994,"PHILADELPHIA—Juliette Comfer, a pink-haired freshman at Temple University, was wild for Bernie Sanders. Now she’s mild for Hillary Clinton. “I don’t love her, but our views are aligned,” she said before Clinton made a pitch for millennial votes at her school on Monday. Orion Tucker, a junior with a nose ring and a hipster goatee, also felt the Bern in the Democratic primary, but he’s also backing Clinton over Donald Trump: “The more Donald runs off his mouth, the clearer the choice gets.” Philip Mattes, a freshman with a scruffy orange beard, is another Bernie Bro who’s transferred to the Clinton train. “If you care about health care, student debt, all the progressive issues, you’ve got to be with her,” he said. Polls suggest that most millennials prefer Clinton to Trump, but especially among college-aged voters who tend to lean left, her margin isn’t nearly as wide as President Obama’s over Mitt Romney. And you could sense why at her speech on Monday. The carefully curated crowd was clearly on her side—there were only about 200 attendees, many of them members of Democratic campus groups who got tickets from her campaign—but the enthusiasm was not exactly overwhelming Story Continued Below In interviews at the event, many of her millennial supporters, especially the former Sanders revolutionaries, talked about her in the could-be-worse tone they might use to describe a boring but socially appropriate romantic partner. They used words like “capable,” “well-informed,” “responsible,” and “qualified.” They dutifully praised her positions on issues like abortion, student debt, mass incarceration, and climate change, while emphasizing the importance of stopping Trump and his inflammatory rhetoric. But most of them did not sound particularly inspired. “Bernie was a genuine grass-roots kind of guy, and he really spoke to the younger generation,” said Nicole Brigstock, a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania who wore a “NO WAR” pin next to her “Ready for Hillary” pin. “He truly cared about progressive issues. I guess I’d like to believe that she does as well.” Clinton’s campaign staff acknowledges that after losing millennials to Sanders by blowout margins in the Democratic primary, she’s still underperforming in that age group in the general. They described the Temple speech as an effort to earn the votes of young people who might not know where she stands on issues like equal pay for women, gay rights, the minimum wage, and college affordability. She also appealed to their sense of tolerance and multiculturalism, attacking Trump as a racist, sexist, and generally divisive figure, repeatedly pushing her campaign themes of Stronger Together and Love Trumps Hate. The conventional wisdom on millennials is that they’re swayed more by passion and emotion than substance—that in politics as well as smartphones, they’re always looking for the shiny new thing. But coming of age with the first black president, very few of them expressed excitement about the prospect of the first woman president. On the other hand, her young supporters here almost all name-checked her more traditional liberal views, in contrast to Trump’s calls to build a wall and undo most of Obama’s work, as well as her knowledge of policy, in even sharper contrast to Trump. In her speech, Clinton admitted she’s not much of an entertainer, but touted her commitment to the “slow, hard business of governing,” pointing out that she knows the interest rate on student loans down to the decimal point. “She’s showing that she’s experienced, she’s reality-based, she cares about policies we care about,” said junior Mike McDermott, a former Sanders supporter who’s on the executive board of the Temple Democrats. “Young people want to see that kind of positive message. It’s not sexy, but it’s about getting the job done.” Margaret Strolle, a graduate student in history at Villanova, said Clinton gets a bad rap from starry-eyed Sanders types who think politics is about waving magic wands and making everything better. She said Clinton is a realist, and like Alexander Hamilton in the Broadway musical, has been in the room where it happens. “People deride her for being part of the system but I like her experience,” Strolle said. “She’s not making big promises about how she’s going to change everything, but she’s committed to getting things done, even if it’s incremental.” Trump is wildly unpopular with millennials, so the real danger for Clinton is that they could vote for third-party candidates or stay home, and she warned Monday that Trump could win if the youth turnout is stagnant. Judging from the students at her event, that might be her strongest millennial message. Tom Quinn, a nursing student and a registered independent who had considered voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson, says he’s now convinced that only two candidates have a path to victory, and that Trump is unacceptable. “We can’t have a racist president,” he said. Bernie Mann, a diehard Sanders supporter—she noted they even share a name—said she’s realized she can vote for his platform by voting for Clinton: “It felt a lot more real from Bernie, but she’s way, way, way better than Trump.” Vicki Gouvalis, a moderate Republican and voted for John Kasich in the primary, said she was undecided before Clinton spoke, then told me after the event she will vote for Clinton. “I was shocked by how much I agreed with her,” Gouvalis said. The good news for Clinton is she has room to grow with undecided millennials who loathe Trump and share many of her views. The bad news is that many of them are undecided because they don’t like her or trust her. Several Clinton supporters who showed up Monday said they’re still concerned about her emails, her support for the Iraq war, and her ties to Wall Street. They said most of their Bernie-or-Bust friends are coming around as the election nears, but not all of them. “Everyone keeps saying she’s a liar, and I’m like, what politician isn’t?” said Jeffrey Fuentes, a junior whose parents are Salvadoran immigrants. “I think people will come around, but they’re not amped up like they were for Bernie.” At Temple, Clinton tried to reach out to reluctant millennials, telling unusually personal stories about her mother and other women who influenced her, urging them to resist the notion that politics is all corrupt and no one ever changes. And there was one group of millennials at the event whose enthusiasm seemed to defy all the punditry: young black voters, who never felt the Bern in the first place. James Walton, a 30-year-old buyer for a Philadelphia manufacturing company, said African-Americans appreciate Clinton’s attention to the minimum wage, police brutality, and gun control; he’s lost three friends to gun violence. “We’re millennials, too,” he said. “And she’s speaking to our demographic.” Jeanmarie Elican, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, said that as a black woman, she appreciates Clinton’s concern about discrimination against minorities, immigrants and gays. But like so many of her fellow Clinton supporters, she said she’s most energized about stopping Trump, a candidate who has dismissed Black Lives Matter, retweeted white supremacists, and argued that blacks should vote for him because their lives are so abysmal they have nothing to lose. “I have plenty to lose,” Elican said. “Donald Trump doesn’t see black people as people. If that’s not a reason to vote, I don’t know what is.”",1,0,0
712,"Before the debate has begun, Clinton has been out-trumped. Apparently Clinton will have billionaire Mark Cuban sitting in the front row of the debate. Some believe this move would intimidate Trump, though the two billionaires don’t really have much of a past together. Cuban recently challenged Trump to a “sit down” to discuss policy for 4 hours with no Clinton-bashing. If Trump accepted, Cuban agreed to donate $1 million to charity. Why Cuban has decided to jump in the presidential fray, since he is as significant in the discussion as navel lint. One might believe that with the ineffectiveness of Hillary Clinton’s “not so secret weapon,” Bill Clinton, that Cuban has become her surrogate. Other than ignore Cuban, if I were Trump, I would have donated $1 million to my own charity, then proclaimed victory over Cuban. My statement would be, “Mark Cuban is a publicity seeker who needs me to be relevant.” As for Hillary Clinton bringing Cuban, this strategy will backfire. To some degree it already has, as in Trump’s response, Hillary Clinton has already been out-trumped. As reported by the Washington Post: Gennifer Flowers, who revealed a sexual relationship with Bill Clinton in the 1990s, is saying she will attend Monday night’s debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as Trump’s guest. Flowers’s assistant confirmed the decision to BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski Saturday afternoon, and Flowers herself told the New York Times in a text message, “Yes, I will be there.” The decision was the latest play in a bizarre bit of gamesmanship between the Clinton and Trump campaigns over the debate. Clinton’s camp confirmed this week that it would invite billionaire mogul Mark Cuban, a Trump antagonist, to the debate. First, Cuban is insignificant. It would be different if Trump hadn’t already marginalized Cuban. Cuban said Trump wasn’t wealthy, then later retracted the statement after more careful examination of Trump’s finances. Cuban is kooky. Sure he’s successful, but not as successful as Trump. Next, by bringing in Cuban, Hillary Clinton opened herself up for LOTS of damage. Trump has already responded by bringing in Jennifer Flowers, a move sure to open more moves. But this may be only the beginning. But Trump has many more “mind-screws” he can do on Hillary and it can all happen before the debate. For example, Trump could invite Anita Broderick, and reference her when Hillary discusses the war on women. He could invite Linda Tripp, and have Linda appear with the infamous “blue dress.” Or Trump could go for the jugular and invite Monica Lewinsky. Perhaps Trump could invite the families of the Benghazi victims, or a few Bernie or Bust supporters. Hillary Clinton has let the genie out of the bottle, and this genie is not her friend. Hillary Clinton has out-trumped herself. ",0,0,1
913,"Viewers of tonight’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  who decide to drink every time Trump tells a lie could very well die of alcohol poisoning, according to the US Surgeon General. After the series of “clown car debates” of 2012, an average of 70,000 additional alcohol poisoning related incidents occurred. Due to the frequently untrue nature of Trump’s comments, first responders are bracing for a potentially more disastrous incident tonight. According to Politico, Trump lied every three minutes and 15 seconds throughout a five day period from Sept. 15 – Sept 20. Medical professionals found themselves in a similar situation last year, before the GOP primary debates. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said “We are anticipating record levels of alcohol poisoning… all across the country, as Americans engage in drinking games while they watch the debate. We can’t impress enough on people about the danger of mixing alcohol and watching the GOP debates, especially with the field the Republicans are giving us this year.” Given the candidate they ultimately chose, the potential for fabrications tonight are higher than ever. The Mayo Clinic reports that signs of alcohol poisoning include vomiting, confusion, seizures, slow breathing (seven breaths a minute or less), blue-tinged or pale skin, hypothermia, and not being able to be woken up after falling asleep. Please do your fact-checking as responsibly as possible.            ",0,1,0
205,"Donald Trump constantly talks about how heâll âmake America great again.â Heâll bring jobs back, put America first, all that populist, nationalist jazz that put him in the position of being the Republican nominee in the first place. However, thereâs one thing Trump can do to help Americans get more jobs: he can actually make his own products in the United States of America. Well, since Trump wonât readily make his manufacturing practices available to the American public on his own campaign website, Hillary has given us a handy guide complete with images, on hers. She calls it âA Buyerâs Guide For Donald Trump.â While Donald Trump says thatÂ âitâs very hard to have apparel made in this country,â orÂ  âthey donât even make the stuff here. Itâs so hard to get.â Hillary proves him wrong right away. Here is a handy map of where Trump can get all of his things made, right here in America, courtesy of HillaryClinton.com:  Hillary then goes ahead to list the individual categories on this map, complete with lists of places that each kind of product can be made. For instance, hereâs all the places Trump can make ties:  Instead, he makes them in China. And that is justÂ example. Go to Hillaryâs website for a full list. In other words, Trumpâs rhetoric is just that: bluster and bombaste for the sake of excusing his anti-American business practices. If Trump wants to bring jobs back to America, he can start with his own companies. Thanks for the handy guide, Hillary! No doubt Trump will never read it. ",0,1,0

The eldest Trump son posted a photo of a bowl of Skittles and a caption that reads, ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?

He was the one to cast the convention floor vote for his father that put the Republican presidential candidate over the top and secured him the nomination. Of the three Trump children active in their father's campaign, Donald Trump Jr. was the first to give a speech at the party convention in Cleveland this summer — which was well received by many in the audience.   ""Donald Trump Jr. was so excellent that my brain was already thinking, ‘What should we run him for?'"" Trisha Turner, the president of the New York State Federation of Republican Women, told ABC News at the convention. He has also played a significant role behind the scenes of his father's campaign. Donald Trump Jr. was extensively involved in the vice presidential selection process, even meeting with V.P. hopeful Christie, along with his siblings Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, without their father present.   In May, Donald Trump Jr. met on his own with Republican officials and the National Rifle Association on Capitol Hill. A registered gun owner and known hunter, he was the one to lead the negotiations with the NRA leading up to the gun rights lobbying group's endorsement of his father, sources told ABC News.",1,0,0
932,"Legendary journalist Dan Rather took to Facebook to give his two cents on tonight’s debate, and his response is a devastating indictment of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s atrocious behavior and obvious inability to stay within the realm of factual reality. Praising Clinton for maintaining her composure in the face of Trump’s aggressive interruptions, he tore into Trump for attempting to force our political atmosphere into a post-truth era and for repudiating the noble values of pluralism and tolerance that our nation was founded on. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever civility once existed in our politics is tonight officially dead. Never in the history of televised debates have we witnessed such a show. And that’s what the Donald wanted. A show. He got it, but will he be seen as the hero or the villain? If you are a fan of Hillary Clinton, I suspect you are thrilled with her poised and confident performance. Perhaps her crowning line was “I prepared for this debate and I’m prepared to be President”. If you are a fan of Donald Trump, his quarrelsome, no-holds-barred approach, often facts be damned, will likely in turn have thrilled you. The question is what does everybody else watching think and how many impressionable voters remain? Taking a snapshot of the debate stage this evening, two candidates behind podiums, each representing one of the major political parties, it would seem to be the latest chapter in our quadrennial dance with democracy. But experiencing the event, in sound and motion, it was of course anything but. From the very beginning, the body language tonight was striking. HIllary Clinton, the first woman ever to be on this stage was calm and substantive. Donald Trump interrupted often and slouched and sneered as he turned to address her. This is what Trump’s fans like about him, playing the alpha male at all costs. Clinton seemed completely unflustered, which is what her fans love about her. How this all plays to the majority of viewers and voters at home will be in the eyes of the beholder. But I was surprised by how much this man who has made so much of the means of television spent not looking into the camera, but preoccupied with his adversary. Trump came across as amped, a pacing tiger ready to pounce on every answer. His Interruptions suggests little regard to the rules. He’s itching for a fight…Wants to swing wildly. Clinton was clearly the policy expert, nimbly jumping from topic to topic, policy to policy. But she was also much more able to paint a big picture than I have seen in times past. I thought she was particularly effective on the issue of race and especially the birther lie against President Obama. She had the facts on her side, but also it was an effective appeal to fire up her base. In the end, more than all of the specifics, I was struck by how unprecedented was the overall tenor – matching that of the campaign. We once held certain truths to be “self-evident” – that “all men are created equal” and “they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” These were the lofty ideals that served as a rallying cry for the founders of these United States to choose liberty over tyranny. The man who wrote these words, Thomas Jefferson, and his compatriots were imperfect and in some cases deeply flawed men. Yet their idealism fixed a North Star in our democratic firmament that has guided our ship of state ever since, with some very noted moral detours. Now I fear that the tide of progress is rapidly receding with the fierce undertow of a looming tsunami. Our Founders believed in reason and the power of intellect. Donald Trump made clear tonight by his wilful ignorance of important issues that he does not. Our founders feared the accumulation of power, they loathed vanity, and tried to build in protections against the demagogues who would appeal to mankind’s basest instincts. Donald Trump relishes in all of these impulses. For him they are instinctual and a prescription for success. To call Trump a con man, as many have, is a disservice to the art of the con. By its definition a con requires deceit. But Trump has not tried to hide his lies or the sheer unrealistic audacity of his cartoonish policy positions. He has asked the American people to bet on him. The fact checkers will certainly weigh in. The pundits will have their say. But the voters have all the information they need. The judgement is in their – or more accurately our – hands. Rather’s words are poetic and nuanced, mixing biting severity with the civilizing admonitions that forged the American journalistic tradition – values that the modern media have abandoned in their ravenous scramble for ratings. We are lucky to have him as a guiding voice during this time of contempt and division. h/t to Dan Rather.",0,1,0
1445,"There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people. The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything. Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension. ",0,0,1
339,"(CNN)Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says he and Donald Trump missed a chance to meet this week due to scheduling problems -- a different version of events than put forward by a Democratic senator. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said Wednesday that Poroshenko sought a meeting with the GOP nominee during the United Nations General Assembly in New York but was ignored. ""Earlier this summer, I led a bipartisan delegation to Eastern Europe. We visited Ukraine in particular, and I know President Poroshenko of Ukraine was seeking a meeting with Donald Trump while he was in New York meeting with the president of Egypt, and was rejected,"" the Delaware Democrat told CNN ""New Day"" host Chris Cuomo. But Poroshenko says that's not how it happened. ""We don't have any refusal,"" the Ukrainian president said in an interview on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" chalking it up to a scheduling conflict during a crammed few days of meeting with 22 heads of state. Poroshenko said he didn't take the lack of a meeting with Trump as a snub, citing bipartisan support in for his country in Congress. Earlier Wednesday a Ukrainian official confirmed to CNN that Poroshenko's office requested a meeting with both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but only received a response from Clinton, who agreed to the meeting. A message left with Trump's campaign Wednesday was not immediately returned. Trump did meet Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, during which the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting. Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko took place just a few minutes before Trump met with el Sisi a short distance away. Before that meeting the Democratic nominee said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts."" Coons -- a vocal supporter of Clinton for president -- was quick to link Trump's decision not to meet with Poroshenko to positive comments Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country, a primary geopolitical antagonist to Ukraine. ""Donald Trump's statements about Ukraine and Putin suggest a dangerous lack of familiarity with Putin's actual record of invading a neighboring country and a dangerous lack of respect for or familiarity with our NATO treaty alliances,"" he said. Coons continued, ""In meetings I had with heads of state in recent days here in New York City, they all expressed real concern or questions about Donald Trump's readiness or fitness to serve as president."" Trump's rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia throughout the US presidential election has prompted criticism and scrutiny, even from members of his own party. The GOP nominee has praised Putin as ""a leader far more than our President has been a leader,"" and suggested that the United States shouldn't automatically come to the defense of NATO allies in Eastern Europe who are threatened by an increasingly aggressive Russia if those countries don't adequately fund their own militaries.

1277,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is planning a “very, very vigorous” travel schedule to campaign on behalf of Hillary Clinton in the weeks leading up to the November election, he said Monday. Sanders, in an interview before Monday night’s first general election debate, told MSNBC’s Brian Williams and Rachel Maddow that he plans to “go all over this country” to advocate for Clinton, the Democratic nominee and his former opponent in the party’s often-contentious primary elections. Story Continued Below “We’re working on a schedule right now, which is going to be a very, very vigorous schedule,” Sanders said. “We’re going to go all over this country. We’re going to go wherever Secretary Clinton’s people think that I am needed, and I am going to work as hard as I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become the next president.” The two are already scheduled to appear together on Wednesday at the University of New Hampshire Field House to discuss college affordability. Clinton has struggled to capture the enthusiasm of some of Sanders’ former supporters, especially the young voters who flocked to his campaign’s promise of “political revolution” and focus on campaign finance reform. When Williams asked Sanders how “hard” he was willing to work to campaign for Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Sanders reiterated his common refrain that “the election of Donald Trump as president would be a disaster for this country.” “I am going to do everything that I can to see that that does not happen,” Sanders said. “When I campaign, I campaign very, very hard.”",1,0,0
1271,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are counting down the hours to their first debate, a heavily hyped and critical encounter that comes as a fresh batch of polls show the race narrowing to a virtual dead heat. The showdown is expected to be a study in contrasts: Clinton, the longtime politician and consummate preparer who has pored over briefing materials in recent weeks, versus Trump, a first-time political candidate who, if aides are to be believed, has eschewed many elements of traditional debate preparation ahead of what could be the most watched political event in U.S history. Story Continued Below The two candidates arrive at Hofstra University in an increasingly taut race, as Clinton’s once-comfortable lead in August has evaporated into a knife’s edge contest well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. “A wheel-to-wheel race,” Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, called it in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt earlier on Monday. Trump and Clinton face two fundamentally different questions headed into Monday night. For Trump: Can the celebrity candidate best known only a few short years ago as the star of “The Apprentice” demonstrate the gravitas necessary for voters to envision him in the Oval Office? For Clinton: Can a woman who has been in the public spotlight for more than two decades — as first lady, senator and secretary of state — ease the electorate’s lingering questions about her trustworthiness? “This debate will have a huge impact,” predicted Judd Gregg, a Republican who played Al Gore and John Kerry in President George W. Bush’s mock debate preparations. Because Trump and Clinton enter the debate with historically high unfavorability ratings, Gregg said, “I think the person who wins this debate is the candidate who is able to increase their likeability and, at the same time, is able to have Americans see them as a leader who will take the country in a positive direction.” TV networks are expecting record audiences with countdown clocks ticking down the hours and minutes in recent days. Clinton’s campaign has prepared for two different Trumps to show up at Hofstra, her aides have said. The first is the insult-throwing bombastic showman who rampaged through Republican primaries. The second is the more controlled and sober candidate who has appeared on the campaign trail of late, someone who might even make a magnanimous gesture toward Clinton on the debate stage. Trump has stayed more disciplined with the help of teleprompters at his rallies and by not subjecting himself to tough questioning in recent weeks, bypassing formal press conferences for 60 days and, for the most part, avoiding extensive interviews with outlets other than Fox News. Neither of those are options on Monday night. But Mari Maseng Will, a longtime GOP debate coach, said Trump has been so outlandish on the campaign trail for the past 15 months that the typical bar for what counts as misbehaving on the debate stage is unusually high for him. “A sigh wouldn’t do it,” she said, referring to Gore’s now-infamous exasperation with Bush in the 2000 debates. “The only thing he could do to turn away people… would be mean,” she said. “That’s a killer in American politics, even for him.” Trump successfully navigated 11 Republican primary debates, but he never had to face one of his opponents one-on-one. Indeed, the smallest crowd he competed against was three other candidates, meaning he will have to fill nearly double the amount of time he ever has before on Monday. That could prove a challenge for a candidate who has mastered the quick sound bite and quip but lacks the depth of knowledge on policy that Clinton has. The debate will last for 90 minutes with no bathroom or commercial breaks. In the hours leading up to the debate, the Clinton and Trump camps sparred less about each other and more about the role of moderator Lester Holt, an NBC anchor. Clinton backers urged Holt to fact-check Trump, whose misrepresentations on the campaign trail have far outnumbered Clinton’s. “We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on CBS on Monday Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, complained about Clinton’s “very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs.” But such pre-game spin and expectations-management end at 9 p.m. eastern. Then the bright lights will shine on Clinton and Trump alone.",1,0,0

At 2 minutes 17 seconds into the video you can see the child’s face. It’s a haunting look of horror and defiance on his face. The Kurdish news source BasNews reported that ISIS has recently opened a child jihadi training center in Mosul called the “Cubs of the Caliphate,” where tiny children are brainwashed with ISIS ideology, taught suicide tactics, and receive instruction on combat training The barbaric Islamic State is doing anything it takes to spread their caliphate across the globe. Child suicide bombers is the new horrific trend of Muslim extremists. In the past 6 months ISIS has trained over 1,000 children to become suicide bombers.

The young boy in the video below was caught by Iraqi police who thought he was acting suspiciously. This footage below is of the police removing the bomb from his body. Anyone who uses children in such a way is going to hell and I am surprised that the Muslim Imams aren’t saying that. This sickening culture is spreading across Europe and the United States as men roam the streets raping women and children as young as 5-yrs-old (that’s been reported) because it’s part of the culture. It is no surprise then that these same ‘men’ would use children to spread their campaign of terror and death.  ",0,0,1
1327,"Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Donald Trump “spiraled out at the end of the debate” Monday night as faced tough questions from moderator Lester Holt and attacks from the former secretary of state. “We saw him to begin to unwind and become unhinged. And as you pointed out, by the end of the debate, that temperament that we're all concerned about, that inability to, you know, think clearly and make good judgments, it just came out,” Mook said of Trump’s performance in an interview on CNN’s “New Day.” Story Continued Below “You know, he just doesn't have the temperament to be president of the United States. You think about if Donald Trump were to sit in the situation room for an hour or 90 minutes and unwind this way,” he added. “I mean, I think it was a huge warning sign. I think that's why, two to one, people think Hillary won this debate.” Perhaps the biggest blow landed by Clinton Monday night came late in the debate, when she attacked Trump’s history of derogatory remarks against women. In a post-debate spin room interview, Trump said he had considered responding by raising Bill Clinton’s history of marital infidelities but opted against it because the couple’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was in the room and Trump though such a comment would be disrespectful. Tuesday morning, Mook dismissed that potential line of attack from Trump, as well as the Manhattan billionaire’s threat that he may use it in subsequent debates. The Clinton campaign manager said Trump was reverting to his primary debate form as a bully because he was lacking on substance on the debate stage. “You know, Donald Trump is a great reality television star, that's where his career really went to the next step. This is -- it's such an obvious dodge. He spiraled out at the end of the debate and so, of course, he wants to bully,” Mook said. “And so he wants to talk about the supposed indiscretions. The American people want to hear how someone's going to create jobs, how they’re going to help them afford education and health care. And he came with no plans. He came with no substance and he had no command of the issues. So this is his way of wallpapering that.” “Trump wants to talk about anything but the actual issues that people care about and that's because he didn't prepare,” he added. “He didn't show up ready to talk about the things that matter in people's lives, and it's unfortunate. We'll see what he does next.”",1,0,0
1027,"Hillary Clinton’s suggestion that Donald Trump’s rhetoric is treasonous and a recruiting tool for the Islamic State is beneath someone who’s running for the U.S. presidency, the Republican presidential nominee said Tuesday. “Her claim that my opposition to radical Islamic terrorism is a recruiting tool — what? How does that have to do with…” Trump began. “I’m being tough. Why is that a recruiting? I’m much tougher than her on this problem, this horrible situation, but she goes around saying it’s a recruiting tool.” Story Continued Below Clinton on Monday hinted that the real estate mogul may be committing treason by “giving aid and comfort to our adversaries” — the constitutional definition of the term — and said that he “is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists.” During a rally in High Point, North Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon, Trump suggested that Clinton was given her recruiting attack line by an advertising firm. “You know, somebody gave her that from Madison Avenue. You know what Madison — that’s advertising,” Trump said. “They gave her that from — they said let’s call it a recruiting tool. But why? Because I’m tough? It’s a recruiting tool?” Clinton’s rhetoric “demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat,” Trump added. “That really is disqualifying for a person seeking the presidency. When she says my opposition to radical Islamic terror provides aid and comfort to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she’s really unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless but beneath the dignity of the office that she seeks.”",1,0,0
430,"Washington (CNN)Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts said Republican nominee Donald Trump's assumption that drugs are a factor in her city's protests is ""presumptuous."" ""It's presumptuous for him to make conclusions like that without having thorough conversations with some of the folks who are here on the ground and are really aware of what's going on and what the reasoning is,"" she told CNN's Carol Costello on ""Newsroom."" Multiple police officers and citizens have been injured this week during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Charlotte police say Scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family said he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. Trump tied the eruption of violent protests to narcotics, telling a Pittsburgh crowd Wednesday that ""drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night."" The GOP nominee offered no evidence to back up that claim but Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, later said it was ""obvious"" that Trump was ""referring to the recent increase in drug related deaths and subsequent news reports, thus making it a hot button issue."" But Roberts said she and Charlotte council members have been in conversations all week with protestors about their motivations. ""We have a much better understanding than Mr. Trump,"" she told Costello. Roberts said frustration with racial inequality throughout Charlotte and the country as a whole over issues such as education, economic development and social justice are the impetus behind the protests. ""We have a history of racial disparity and we are working very hard in our city to bridge that gap,"" she said. ""We're working very hard to make sure opportunity is spread equally around our city."" ",1,0,0
419,"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama vetoed a bill Friday that would allow family members of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, pitting him against Congress and both presidential candidates on an emotionally charged matter. The White House claimed the legislation could expose US diplomats and servicemen to litigation in other countries. Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress say they'll override Obama's veto next week. Obama has now issued 12 vetoes. If successful, Congress' override would be the first of Obama's presidency. Support for the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act"" ran high among lawmakers, who overwhelmingly passed the bill earlier this year after pressure from victims' groups. The bill would end foreign countries' immunity in the United States from lawsuits, allowing federal civil suits to go forward if the country is determined to have had a hand in a US terror attack. In his veto message, Obama wrote he had ""deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously."" But he maintained the legislation would seriously hurt US national security interests and cause harm to important alliances, saying it ""would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks."" He warned that the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism ""out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts."" Obama also said the move would open Americans abroad, especially those serving in the military, to prosecutions by foreign countries, since this would remove the reciprocal agreements that now protect both sides from such lawsuits. He also pointed to complaints that allied nations have made about the measure. This legislation, he said, ""threatens to limit their cooperation on key national security issues, including counterterrorism initiatives, at a crucial time when we are trying to build coalitions, not create divisions."" Demonstrating the difficult political position the White House is in, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, expressed her support for the legislation Friday. ""Clinton continues to support the efforts by Sen. (Chuck) Schumer and his colleagues in Congress to secure the ability of 9/11 families and other victims of terror to hold accountable those responsible,"" said Jesse Lehrich, a Clinton spokesman. ""She would sign this legislation if it came to her desk."" Following the veto, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said in a statement the move ""is shameful and will go down as one of the low points of his presidency."" Trump, too, said he would sign the legislation as president. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was a lead supporter of the bill, called the veto ""a disappointing decision that will be swiftly and soundly overturned in Congress."" Co-sponsor Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said, ""I look forward to the opportunity for Congress to override the President's veto, provide these families with the chance to seek the justice they deserve and send a clear message that we will not tolerate those who finance terrorism in the United States."" White House lobbying effort In recent days, some of the measure's supporters in Congress have expressed misgivings about the legislation, prompting a new effort by the administration to lobby against the bill. The White House indicated Friday that was still working to sway lawmakers against the bill, saying that some had indicated privately they had doubts about the measure's implications. ""If we're focused on the substantive, long-term impact on our nation's national security, that's what's driving the position, that's what's driving the President's decision to veto this bill -- not because it's politically convenient, it's not; it's political inconvenient,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. "" But when it comes to the stakes and the impact that this could have on our national security, the President is willing to take some political heat in order to try to do the right thing."" The lobbying effort on Capitol Hill against the legislation has involved the administration but also representatives for the Saudi government, which denies any involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks. The alliance puts Obama in the unlikely position of defending the same position as the Kingdom, with which he's had longstanding disputes over counterterrorism strategies and human rights. It also puts the President at odds with family members of 9/11 victims, who protested outside the White House this week and spoke alongside lawmakers from New York and Connecticut on Capitol Hill. They, along with other proponents of the bill, say the language is written narrowly to prevent the types of repercussions the administration predicts. ""We are outraged and dismayed at the President's veto of JASTA and the unconvincing and unsupportable reasons that he offers as explanation,"" read a statement from the 9/11 Families and Survivors. ""No matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, JASTA is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades."" Veto override plans Administration officials had been eying a Friday afternoon veto with the hopes of submitting it to lawmakers after Congress adjourned until November's election contests. But prolonged negotiations over a government funding bill and a package to combat Zika virus have delayed the recess, meaning lawmakers are still likely to be in Washington next week to cast an override vote. ""Our assumption is that the veto will be overridden,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul Ryan followed suit Wednesday, saying, ""I do think the votes are there for the override."" But the Wisconsin Republican also voiced his own doubts about the legislation, saying the implications for lawsuits against Americans worried him. ""I worry about legal matters,"" Ryan said. ""I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court."" He was one of several prominent lawmakers who have expressed buyers' remorse for the proposed law. A pair of Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have pushed for changes to make it more difficult for the families to pursue lawsuits but could also make it harder for the US to be sued for alleged wrongdoing. Opponents of the bill gained support Wednesday both from the European Union, which issued its opposition in the form of a ""demarche"" statement to the US Department of State, and from a bipartisan group of former national security officials, who penned an open letter to Obama. ""The harm this legislation will cause the United States will be both dramatic and long-lasting,"" the letter read, citing arguments over weakening sovereign immunity. Its signatories included veterans of Republican and Democratic administrations, including Stephen Hadley, a national security adviser to President George W. Bush; Michael Mukasey, a US attorney general under Bush; William Cohen, a secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton; and Richard Clarke, a national security aide to Bush and Clinton. The letter also noted the law, if enacted, ""will most certainly undermine our relationship with one of our most important allies, Saudi Arabia, and damage our relationship with the entire Middle East.""

414,"WashingtonSince we last updated the CNN battleground map, Donald Trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.  And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. Why two congressional districts could be key to this election With four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. What's changed? -- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican"" -- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican"" -- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" -- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground"" Explore the map and make your choices Road to 270: Electoral College map Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. The state of play Donald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.  That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.  Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.  Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column.  There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump. It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall. Ohio poised to go down to the line on Election Day That's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio. Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.

520,"Washington (CNN)The first presidential debate broke viewing records Monday, but a number of key Senate Republicans getting grilled over Donald Trump's Miss Universe comments say they either weren't watching or don't have an opinion on one of the night's signature moments. ""I didn't get to see it. I was traveling back from Utah. Stupid plane wouldn't let us tie into CNN. So I felt bad about that. I'm going to talk to them,"" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said. ""I didn't see it guys, I was on an airplane,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Trump's former GOP primary rivals, told reporters. Sen. Ted Cruz, who only fully embraced Trump last Friday, didn't want to talk to reporters. ""We put out a statement last night,"" he told CNN, as he ran into the Senate chamber. Those who claimed to missed the debate had it the easiest. As they have all year long, GOP lawmakers have been in a bind as they were forced to confront the latest controversial statement from Trump. Tuesday, the questions were about the debate and his comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Hillary Clinton placed his comments blasting former Machado for putting on too much weight front and center Monday night, and Trump fueled the fire Tuesday morning on Fox News. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton said Monday night. ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" But GOP lawmakers who praised Trump's debate performance ducked questions about Machado. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked about the Machado and Trump's debate performance, he limited his answer to just: ""On the debate, I thought he did just fine."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has openly criticized Trump's remarks he viewed as racist, refused to engage on Machado: ""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it."" Dodging questions about Trump has become old hat inside the Capitol, since Trump first broke through the field of Republican candidates, and then fought his way to the nomination. Trump's accusation that the judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit was impartial because he was ""Mexican"" (the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is from Indiana) -- left lawmakers in a similar lurch this past June. The Trump answers have become almost perfunctory, based on Tuesday's informal survey. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats: ""No comment."" Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander: ""No comment."" Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who is in a tough battle to hold his seat, repeatedly said, ""Not going to talk about it."" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, was one of the only Republicans to weigh in on Trump's Miss Universe comment: ""Well, those are comments I don't agree with."" Other lawmakers had effusive praise for Trump when asked broadly about the debate, but little to say on the specifics. West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito explained that she had been listening to the debate in the car and thought Trump did an excellent job. But when asked about Trump's Miss Universe comments, she said she must have missed that part. Sen. Joni Ernst, who stood on stage with Trump at her ""Roast and Ride"" event last month, said, ""I thought it was good."" But when a reporter tried to ask about specifics, she said, ""That's about all the comments I have. But thank you."" Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina got a question about Trump's answers on criminal justice reform, and said, ""I shouldn't have stopped."" Then Scott got a question about Trump taking donations from the private prison industry and he stood there, mouth shut and smiling. But when asked broadly about Trump's performance, he started talking again. ""About his performance? I think he had high points and low points, and at the end of the day I'm looking forward to the next debate with more high points,"" Scott said, as he searched for an elevator. But when he was asked what Trump's low points were, Scott stood silent for a few seconds, appearing to stall for an elevator.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg looks on during a press conference | Adem Altan/AFP via Getty By Jacopo Barigazzi 9/27/16, 3:22 PM CET Updated 9/30/16, 11:46 AM CET BRATISLAVA — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg struck back Tuesday at Donald Trump over the U.S. presidential candidate’s claim that the Atlantic alliance is now fighting terrorism only because of his criticism. “NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it’s not a result of the U.S. elections campaign,” said Stoltenberg in a press conference during a gathering of European defense ministers in Bratislava. Trump, who has been critical of NATO and even gone so far as to question the U.S. membership of it, said Monday night in a debate with his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton that he now supported the alliance. “I’m all for NATO,” Trump said. “But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they’re going to do that. And that was — believe me, I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.” Also On Politico Zoya Sheftalovich Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO’s track record of fighting terrorism. “We went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,” he said, stressing that it was “our biggest military operation ever.” NATO “has and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism” and the organization has “stepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.” Stoltenberg also said that NATO’s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence “will also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.” But he insisted the role is “something which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

1435,"There is no law against burning the American flag. There is no law against stomping upon it either. However, that doesn’t mean that parents should have to accept a teacher teaching their kids to hate America.   Hatred for America and her history and values is all the rage these days amongst the left. Believing it to be chic and edgy, many liberals are apt to stomp upon the flag that greater Americans than they fought and died to defend. One history teacher at a public school stomped on the American flag to prove some kind of point and now, unsurprisingly, people are upset. A teacher on Monday at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina – home of Fort Bragg and America’s Special Forces – stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the First Amendment. The school district claims that they are investigating the incident. However, with teachers being fiercely guarded by union extortionists, it’s doubtful that this man will see any repercussions unless he dares to mention Christ. “What that teacher did was a gut punch to all the military kids at that school,” one parent said. “More so to the ones with deployed parents and unforgivably so to Gold Star kids who lost a parent who fought under that flag. It is indefensible.” “Clearly there are other ways to teach First Amendment rights without desecrating a flag,” the superintendent said. Students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. Several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. This man should not be thrown into a gulag, but let’s not pretend that teaching kids to hate America and her symbols of freedom is some kind of educational opportunity. Just another day in the far-left educational system…   ",0,0,1
1431,"A Marine family in Michigan said goodbye to its beloved K-9 with a fitting funeral. Rico was a Marine K-9 who served two tours in Afghanistan and was part of more than 240 missions and 30 firefights. He lived just over 12 years by the side of his owner, Marine Staff Sgt. Russ Beckley, Jr. “There was not a moment when it wasn’t his mission or his goal to be by my side. I was everything to him. And he was everything to me,” Beckley told WOOD.  After spending more than a year apart, Beckley and Rico were reunited in mid-June at the sergeant’s parents’ home. The dog was in declining health due to age, and the family had made the decision to have him put down. “Mainly I was thinking about how loyal he was to our family. To my son. To myself. And to our country,” Russ Beckley, Sr. said of his last moment with the dog. “He just kinda melted into my arms and we had a very nice goodbye.” Beckley said he “thanked Rico” for everything he’d done for him. “And I told him that I loved him,” he added. The dog then got a proper military send-off, with Beckley lowering his American flag to half-staff and visitors coming to pay their respects at a memorial set up by the family. Beckley and his father -- dressed in their uniforms -- carried their beloved dog in a flag-draped coffin. Beckley said that while it’s hard saying goodbye his beloved dog, he knows it isn’t the last time they’ll be together. “I can just imagine one day, seeing my great grandfather, my grandfather, my father and my mother, standing there with Rico. And we will all be together again,” he said. ",0,0,1
909,"This Thursday Ohio Republican Representative Warren Davidson reaffirmed his statement that “moochers” and “pretenders” are blocking the Veterans Affairs’ health care system. At a town hall event Monday morning in West Chester, Ohio Boehner’s successor spoke to the Concerned Veterans for America, accusing the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system of buckling under the weight of “moochers.” “Just like workers comp out here’s got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,” said Davidson. “But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they’re clogging up the system. And we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that’s a problem in the vet community too.” In response, the GOP chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL), antagonized Davison for his reductive remarks but took it easy on him by saying, “I can only hope that Rep. Davidson misspoke, and I look forward to him clarifying his remarks.” Joe Davis, a national spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, also responded negatively to Davidson’s comments, saying “honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers.” On the other side of the aisle, Democrats also seized the opportunity to reject Davidson’s remarks, calling them irresponsible and rude. Steve Fought, a Democrat in Ohio’s 8th congressional district who ran an election against Davidson, said Davidson “is the first congressman ever to blame the shortcomings of the VA health care system on the veterans themselves.” The chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, David Pepper, also jumped on the bandwagon saying, “I would like to know just how he intends to decide which veterans are worthy of health care and which ones are ‘moochers’. Perhaps the congressman is frustrated with the system, but the solution isn’t to kick veterans off the health care coverage they’ve earned through service to their country.” Davidson, however was notably unfazed and doubled down on his remarks Thursday saying, “As a veteran, I know the subpar care that many of my brothers and sisters in arms have received, and I will not be content until that is changed. Any effort to suggest I have anything other than a soldier’s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest.” Despite Davidson’s conviction about “moochers” and “pretenders” in the veteran community, only one of the four cases of VA benefits fraud found and prosecuted by the inspector general involved VA health care services. Hardly enough to make a dent in the administration of VA health care services, or make sweeping generalizations about a community that has had to make the most tangible sacrifices for the well-being of the nation.",0,1,0
1035,"NEW YORK — President Barack Obama called on nations to ""welcome the stranger"" on Tuesday during a much-touted gathering on refugees aimed at rallying support for the record 65 million people displaced around the world. He also managed to take a veiled shot at Donald Trump. Story Continued Below The U.S.-sponsored summit, which drew a number of private sector participants, was one of two major refugee-related gatherings this week on the margins of the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting. The events took place as New York-area authorities pursued and caught an Afghan-born bombing suspect, the hunt for whom fueled the debate in the U.S. presidential race over refugees. Trump has slammed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for her openness to taking in refugees and other immigrants. (One of Trump's sons, in a tweet that provoked backlash on Monday, compared refugees to poisonous Skittles.) Clinton has defended her stance, while calling for proper vetting of all who enter the U.S. In a subtle rebuke of the Republican nominee's promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Obama framed the world's response to the refugee crisis as ""a test of our common humanity — whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in one another."" The president also spoke of the cause of one of the biggest refugee crises today: the war in Syria. But he gave no indication he was willing to consider a greater U.S. military role to help end that conflict. ""Wars like the savagery in Syria must be brought to an end,"" he said, adding that it must be ""through political settlements and diplomacy, not simply by bombing."" The White House unveiled a series of commitments from the international community in response to the call for action from Obama and other allies in the United Nations. They include some $650 million, including in-kind contributions, from more than 50 private-sector entities. The largest share was a $500 million investment pledge from billionaire George Soros, who wrote in The Wall Street Journal that he will pump money into ""startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves."" Ahead of this week's summits, the Obama administration announced the United States will take in 110,000 refugees from around the world, including a ""significant"" number of Syrians, in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. That figure disappointed refugee advocates who'd hoped the administration would take it closer to 200,000 refugees. The president is, after all, urging other countries to double their intake, and a growing number of countries have stepped up to take refugees for the first time or expand their resettlement programs. In the fiscal year wrapping up this month, the U.S. will have accepted 85,000 refugees. Still, advocacy groups have expressed overall strong support for the U.S.-sponsored summit, saying it will achieve concrete results. Activists were less impressed with a U.N.-sponsored refugee summit held Monday, which kicked down the road until 2018 many difficult decisions about how the global community should handle migration crises.",1,0,0
396,"(CNN)As Charlotte becomes the latest city to erupt in racial tension, Massachusetts' highest court ruled this week that just because a black suspect flees police, it does not necessarily signify guilt. The Supreme Judicial Court held unanimously that a black male in Boston, when approached by the police, ""might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity."" The court pointed to statistics in a recent Boston Police Department report that revealed that ""black men in the City of Boston were more likely to be targeted for police-civilian encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations."" The case at issue concerned Jimmy Warren, who was stopped in December 2011 by a Boston police officer responding to a break in that had occurred in the neighborhood. Responding police officer Christopher R. Carr saw Warren and a friend and called out, ""Hey fellas."" Warren turned and ran up a hill into a park and Carr observed him clutching the right side of his pants. Carr lost sight of Warren, but eventually caught up with him in the backyard of a house. Carr drew his weapon and yelled for him to get down. After a struggle, Carr arrested Warren and found no gun on his person. Minutes after the arrest police recovered a Walther .22 caliber firearm in the front yard. Warren told the officer that he did not have a license to carry a firearm and he was later charged with unlawful possession. Nelson P. Lovins, brought the case to the state's high court after Warren lost below. Lovins argued that police did not have the reasonable suspicion to issue a stop, and the gun evidence had to be suppressed. He argued that the police pursued his client with the intent of questioning him, but they lacked the basis to do so. ""My client was never charged with a break in -- only with illegal possession of a gun, "" Lovins said in an interview. The court ruled in Warren's favor, noting that a stop has to be grounded in an officers' ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person was involved with a crime. That suspicion, the court said, had to be grounded in ""specific, articulable facts."" ""We are not persuaded that the information available to the police at the time of the seizure was sufficiently specific to establish reasonable suspicion that the defendant was connected to the breaking and entering under investigation,"" the court held, then walking through all of the factors the police had considered including the description of the suspects, the proximity to the crime, and the fact that Warren had run. On the last factor, the court pointed out a ""cautionary note"" pointing to statistics specific to Boston. The court warned that a reasonable suspicion calculus ""cannot be divorced from the finding in a recent Boston Police Department report documenting a pattern of racial profiling"" of black males in the city. The court said it did not eliminate flight as a factor for the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop, but in those circumstances ""flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt."" ""Rather, the finding that black males in Boston are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted"" the Court said, ""suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt."" Lovins hopes that this case will influence trial judges down the road that just because a black man is fleeing that doesn't necessarily mean he is guilty. ""We've demonstrated that there are other reasons for flight, certainly in the case of black males who have been targeted for stops and searches disproportionally,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Boston Police Department issued a statement saying the court's decision was ""very troubling."" ""For it to consider studies that were never introduced into evidence or offered into the record is concerning,"" the statement said, ""At the very least the court should have heard from experts who compiled and analyzed the data."" Matthew Segal, the legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, says that the police and prosecutors invited the data into the discussions because they are the ones who asserted that flight was automatically suspicious. The ACLU used the same statistics from the Boston Police Department to conclude that black people and communities in Boston were not being treated the same as white people in white communities. ""This is a potentially huge decision,"" said Segal. ""The Black Lives Matter movement can change the law in this country, if more courts follow the lead of the Supreme Judicial Court and look at the reasonableness standard from the perspective of the civilian.

1007,"ALBANY — While Donald Trump and his supporters have recently expressed optimism the Republican presidential nominee can carry New York in November, he still has a lot of ground to make up for that to happen. A poll conducted by the Siena College Research Institute last week found Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leading Trump 51 percent to 30 percent in New York with third-party candidates included, a modest change from the 50 percent to 25 lead she enjoyed in August. Story Continued Below While the two most recent Siena polls aren’t perfectly comparable — last month’s looked at registered voters, while the one released Tuesday deals with likely voters — there were some demographic groups among which Trump showed improvement. In particular, voters in New York City’s suburbs seem to have warmed to him. Clinton led there, 42 percent to 31 percent in August; the gap has since narrowed to 39 percent to 38 percent. Trump also appears to be doing slightly better among young voters (those between 18 and 34 years old backed Clinton 51 percent to 18 in August; now they back her 53 percent to 27 percent) and Jewish voters (Clinton’s lead slid from 51 percent to 25 percent in August to 45 percent to 31 percent this month). But Trump’s support plummeted among low-income earners. In August, people earning less than $50,000 a year backed Clinton 46 percent to 29; her lead among that group now stands at 64 percent to 23 percent, the poll found. Additionally, Clinton’s lead among African Americans increased from 79 percent to 5 percent last month to 85 percent to 1 percent in the latest poll. Trump is now running fourth among the state’s black electorate, with his 1percent falling short of Libertarian Gary Johnson’s 4 percent and the Green Party’s Jill Stein’s 3 percent. The new poll also found that U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer’s lead over Republican challenger Wendy Long has grown from 63 percent to 24 percent in August to 69 percent to 23 percent this month. If undecided voters break the same way as those who have already made up their minds, Schumer is on pace to received 75 percent of the vote in November, passing the modern record of 72.2 percent Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand received when she defeated Long in 2012. In other findings, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s favorability stands at 57 percent, up slightly from the 53 percent favorability rating he enjoyed in August. But voters said they “prefer someone else” to Cuomo in the 2018 gubernatorial race by a margin of 49 percent to 45 percent, up slightly from 47 percent to 46 percent last month. The Siena poll has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points. Siena predicts that this year’s electorate will be 50 percent Democratic, 25 percent Republican, and 21 percent “independent/ other.” View the poll’s crosstabs here: http://bit.ly/2cXG8e0",1,0,0
1,"With the Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debates upon us, the quadrennial question comes begging: Do these showdowns matter? The chances for impact seem ripe this year. The two most unpopular major-party candidates in the history of ABC News/Washington Post polls are facing off. Donald Trump's unorthodox campaign style and provocative positions have piqued public interest; the debates may be the single best opportunity for him to allay concerns about his qualifications, temperament and policy promises alike. Hillary Clinton, for her part, needs -– like Trump -– to ease questions about her trustworthiness, as well as to spark greater enthusiasm among her supporters. Can either candidate move the needle? It will be tough: A review of data since 1960 suggests that past debates have almost never directly and measurably changed the candidates' relative standings. That's admittedly a high standard, though, and at least some debates may have had more subtle impacts. Debates have been held in 11 presidential races since 1960. We find just one after which the lead in presidential preference changed hands by a significant margin: In 1980, when Ronald Reagan uttered his ""are you better off?"" line. He gained 7 points in a post-debate poll. Still, there are other cases in which debates (or post-debate evaluations) may have influenced campaign dynamics. Debates are, after all, an essential window on the candidates’ styles and grasp of the issues. They can seem to add or reverse momentum. And polls are only so precise. Consider 1960: After Richard Nixon’s pasty-faced performance, John F. Kennedy went from 46 percent support to 49 percent in Gallup data; Nixon, from 47 percent to 46 percent. Those changes were within the polls' margin of sampling error. Nonetheless, the numerical ""lead"" switched, and collective memory maintains that the debates spelled Nixon's narrow defeat. Nor did Gallup polls show significant movement immediately after the 1976 debate in which Gerald Ford said Poland was free (and news reports pounced on the misstatement); Jimmy Carter gained a single point, Ford lost 3. Still, even if not measurably, the gaffe may have halted what had been a slide in Carter's lead. Then 73-year-old Reagan's teasing jibe in 1984 about 56-year-old Walter Mondale's ""youth and inexperience"" didn't meaningfully change the numbers in ABC News/Washington Post polls, but perhaps helped put aside questions about Reagan's age and acuity. In 2000, Al Gore's wonk-heavy performance saw him go in at +2 and leave at -3, but again, that was within sampling error. There's also the question of missed opportunities, as in Mike Dukakis' bloodless answer, in 1988, to what he'd do if his wife were raped and murdered. He didn't seize on the chance to show a non-technocratic side. And ABC/Post polls did not meaningfully move. ABC News/Washington Post polls in 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2012 also showed no significant movement around the debates. In 1992 there was more movement, including a significant gain for Ross Perot, but never enough to change Bill Clinton’s advantage. In instant reactions, at least, polling has found that debates typically reinforce preconceived notions rather than change them. Most of each candidates' supporters say it's their candidate who won, and precious few say their minds were changed. But post-debate evaluations can shift. In 1992, right after the first debate, 24 percent of viewers said Perot had won. By the next night, amid positive reviews of Perot's performance, that grew to 37 percent among people who'd watched, heard or read about it. And Perot's support did advance, from 6 percent before the debates to 17 percent after them. That shift may have been real, but it also may have reflected the challenges of immediate post-debate reaction polls. Conducted in mere minutes, among individuals pre-recruited to participate, they're subject to considerable sampling and weighting limitations. Further, some ask who ""won,"" others who ""did the better job""; some accept ""tie"" as an answer and some don't. Instant reactions also bypass the role of considered judgment. Hard as it may be to believe in the Twitter Age, sometimes people actually need a little while to think about things. The clearest response to the debates this year may take some days to emerge.  Here's a rundown of the measurable debate effect (or lack thereof) in each election since 1960. There were no debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972. Click here for data tables associated with each election. 1960: Gallup had Nixon +1, but that was 12 days before the first debate; it had Kennedy +3 after it. Twelve days is a long time and 4 points is a small number. Gallup didn't poll between the remaining three debates, but showed Kennedy +4 after the last one. 1976: News reports jumped on Ford's misstatement of Soviet domination of Eastern Europe in the second debate. Carter's lead had been diminishing, and that did stop after this debate. But the measured change after the second debate was tiny -- Carter gained 1 point, Ford lost 3. 1980: This one looks to have mattered: Gallup's pre-debate poll had Carter +8; post-debate, Reagan +3. (John Anderson did not participate.) 1984: Mondale crept up, but Reagan stayed ahead by double digits nonetheless. 1988: We don't have an ABC poll done right before the first debate; in a Gallup poll it was George H. W. Bush +8. Our poll after the second debate showed no meaningful movement. 1992: Perot moved up 5 points in ABC News polling after the first debate and 4 points after the third debate. Before the debates he had 6 percent support; after the last debate he was up to 17 percent. Clinton moved up by 5 points after the second debate, Bush down by 6, then Clinton down by 6 after the third. But Clinton led throughout. 1996: The race looked perhaps slightly tighter after the second debate, but Clinton maintained a double-digit lead throughout. 2000: Gore went in +2 and came out -3 -– a change of lead, but within sampling error. And a week after the last debate it was back to a dead heat, 47-47 percent. 2004: There were some wiggles in the debate period –- a 6-point lead for George W. Bush before the first debate was a dead heat before the third -– but when all was said and done the race after the debates looked a lot like the race before them. 2008: The main shift in vote preference came before the first debate, as Obama seized the reins of economic discontent after the failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September. McCain's +2 in early September, just after the GOP convention, proved to be his best. The race shifted to Obama +9 in an ABC/Post poll completed Sept. 22, four days before the first debate. Obama never trailed again. 2012: Obama was +2 ahead of the first debate in ABC/Post polls, within the margin of sampling error, +3 after the second debate and -1 after the final debate, all within sampling error.",1,0,0
781,"Judge Jeanine Pirro has been outspoken against Hillary Clinton for some time, but never more so when the infamous “deplorable” comment was mentioned by ol’ Hillary. In Pirro’s most recent opening statement, she absolutely UNLOADED on Clinton, and it’s one you’re going to want to play on repeat. “This week, Hillary’s all better, and she and her surrogates call on all Americans—all but us ‘Deplorables’—to stand up and repudiate Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric—through their own divisive rhetoric!” Pirro said in her Opening Statement. “Hillary is so desperate for the black vote that she insists on creating race issues,” she said, playing a clip of Clinton last week accusing Trump of “describ[ing] the black community in such insulting and ignorant terms.” “Isn’t Donald Trump speaking to the problems of the minority communities in inner cities? Maybe your recent health issues have prevented you from grasping the reality of inner city crime,” Pirro said, adding that her criticisms of Trump could easily be an indictment of her own actions. “You choose to create division—you look for a target: the police, Donald Trump, a common enemy. Then you promise the world and you have the gall to actually say “imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world…who sees someone who doesn’t look like him and agree with him, and thinks that person must not be a real America.” “This is exactly what you said when you called us ‘deplorable’,” Pirro said. “I know you have double-vision and memory problems—documented by the FBI—but your hypocrisy is stunning. You’re the ‘hater’. You’re the one who said ‘we are above all that’.”  Hillary Clinton is the one that’s calling racism when it’s the Democrats, PROVEN by the DNC email leak, who are the true racists. They preach tolerance and equality, but they utilize that platform to keep minority populations at bay and not let them thrive. It’s absolutely appalling and we shouldn’t stand for it. This is just another nail in the political coffin for Clinton. Soon she’ll be gone from our minds and Trump will be president. You can make that happen this November. (Source: Fox News) ",0,0,1
702,"In a scathing interview in which he admits he will be cast by Democrats of not being a “team player,” the man who was America’s first black governor, Democrat Douglas Wilder, accused the Democrat Party of taking black voters for granted, said blacks are no better off after eight disappointing years of Obama, and that Hillary Clinton can’t win the White House running on a message that she’s the second worst person in the world (assuming Donald Trump is the first). Perhaps equally embarrassing for Hillary Clinton, Douglas Wilder praised Republican Donald Trump’s recent outreach to black voters, giving him credit for doing it even if it lacks authenticity. “The African American community has not been served,” Wilder, who was elected to be Virginia’s governor in 1989 told the Washington Post on Thursday, a reference to the Obama administration. “Don’t piss on me and tell me it’s raining!” he said, noting that Obama should “admit it” rather than telling black Americans “to quit whining when they’re asked for legitimate grievances to be addressed.” “I’m entitled to my criticism of Obama because I was one of the first people to support him,” he told The Post. In regards to Hillary Clinton, Wilder said that she needs to do more than just paint herself as not as bad as Donald Trump, but used harsh language to make his point. “Let’s assume (Trump) is the worst guy in the world. Fine. What makes you better? Because you’re not considered the worst, but right next to it!” Wilder, clearly no fan of Donald Trump’s either, said that he’s a “huckster” and is “good at it,” but nevertheless applauded his outreach to black voters. “Whether it’s genuine or legitimate or not, at least he’s doing it,” he said. “Either way, I think it’s good.” Wilder said that even after eight years of Obama, the country is still in a “mess” and that Hillary Clinton needs to be much more specific on ideas and policy positions she has to make things better and said that she has “blundered” by making the election a “referendum on Donald Trump.” “When I ran for office, I never mentioned my opponent’s name. I always said, ‘Vote for me for these reasons,” Wilder said. Douglas Wilder has always been outspoken and politically incorrect, which is refreshing. It would be interesting to see what the country would look like if he’d have been the first black president the past eight years instead of Obama.  Email Subscribe",0,0,1
459,"(CNN)Just one point separates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in two states that are critical to both candidates' chances of becoming president, according to new CNN/ORC polls in Pennsylvania and Colorado. In Colorado, likely voters break 42% for Trump, 41% for Clinton, 13% for Libertarian Gary Johnson and 3% for Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Pennsylvania's likely voters split 45% for Clinton, 44% for Trump, 6% for Johnson and 3% for Stein. Those divides are well within each poll's 3.5-point margin of sampling error. Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle The new results in two battleground states underscore the closeness of the race and come as the candidates prepare to square off Monday night in their high-stakes first debate at Long Island's Hofstra University. In both states, sharp divisions among whites by education are evident, with white college graduates choosing Clinton over Trump by 11 points in Pennsylvania and 16 points in Colorado, while whites who do not hold four-year degrees break in Trump's favor by 19 points in Pennsylvania and 22 points in Colorado. Read full Colorado results In Colorado, that education gap is a bigger divide than gender or age, and is even larger than the racial gap in the state. Pennsylvania's likely voters are more divided than Colorado's along gender and racial lines. Johnson's appeal among younger voters appears to be working to Clinton's detriment in both states. While Trump's numbers are significantly lower among voters under 45 than among older voters, Clinton's are roughly the same across age groups, while Johnson's support multiplies among younger voters. Clinton fares better in two-way matchups in both states, topping Trump 50% to 47% among likely voters in Pennsylvania and 49% to 47% in Colorado. Though both results are within the polls' margin of sampling error, the finding suggests she could fare better in each state if third party candidate support dipped. The two polls come alongside tight national polls and neck-and-neck poll results in several other key battleground states including Ohio, Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders In both Colorado and Pennsylvania, the economy stands out as far and away the top voter concern. About half of registered voters in each state, and a similar share of likely voters, call the economy most important out of a list also including terrorism, illegal immigration and foreign policy. And when asked which candidate would better handle the economy, Trump comes out on top in both states, though within each poll's margin of error. Clinton holds broad advantages for handling foreign policy in both states, and she tops Trump by 8 points on handling immigration in Colorado, a state where a Pew Research Center analysis recently estimated that about a quarter of the state's sizable Latino population is foreign born. In Pennsylvania, the two candidates run about even on that issue. And in the wake of terror attacks in New York and New Jersey, voters in both states are about evenly split on who would better handle terrorism. Read full Pennsylvania results The poll suggests Clinton has made an effective case that Trump does not have the temperament to be president -- she is viewed as better suited for the presidency by a nearly two-to-one margin in each state on that score -- and she holds smaller advantages as the better candidate to be commander-in-chief. But Clinton continues to lag behind Trump when voters are asked which of the two is more honest and trustworthy. Trump's contention that Clinton lacks the stamina for the job splits voters in Colorado, 48% see him as having the better stamina, 45% choose Clinton. In Pennsylvania, Trump holds a larger advantage on that, 50% to 45%. Democrats have a narrow edge in the race for Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate seat, with Katie McGinty topping incumbent Pat Toomey 49% to 46% among likely voters, just inside the poll's margin of error, and a broad lead in Colorado's Senate contest, with incumbent Michael Bennet up 53% to 43% over Republican challenger Darryl Glenn. The CNN/ORC Polls in Colorado and Pennsylvania were conducted by telephone Sept. 20-25. The Colorado poll included interviews with 1,010 adult residents of the state, including 784 who are likely to vote in November. In Pennsylvania, interviews were conducted with 1,032 adult residents of the state, including 771 likely voters. Results for likely voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in each state. ",1,0,0
1243,"The race for the White House is essentially tied heading into tonight’s presidential debate, yet another national poll released on Monday shows. According to the latest Quinnipiac national poll, Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump 44 percent to 43 percent among likely voters in a four-way race, with 8 percent supporting Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and 1 percent backing the Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Story Continued Below In a two-way race, Clinton leads Trump by a similar margin, 47 percent to 46 percent. The poll shows little change since Quinnipiac’s September survey, when Clinton led Trump 41-39 percent in a four-way race. While Clinton leads among women 47 percent to 42 percent, Trump holds a similar advantage among men, 44 percent to 40 percent. Independents also favor Trump, as well as white voters, though non-white voters overwhelmingly prefer Clinton. Eight-four percent of respondents plan to tune into Monday’s primetime debate, which 41 percent of likely voters expect Clinton to win (32 percent said Trump will win the debate). The Quinnipiac poll mirrors recent national and swing state surveys that have shown a tightening race, including a national Bloomberg poll in which Trump narrowly leads by 2 percentage points and CNN/ORC surveys of Pennsylvania and Colorado that show a virtual tie. Polling averages still show a slight Clinton lead: RealClearPolitics has her 2.1 points ahead, while HuffPollster has her leading Trump by 4 points. FiveThirtyEight has Clinton up by 1.1 points. According to POLITICO’s average of battleground state polls, Clinton’s lead is 2.8 points in the 11 states most likely to decide the Electoral College vote. For Monday’s poll, Quinnipiac surveyed 1,115 likely voters by landline and telephone from Sept. 22-25, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.",1,0,0
123,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate. But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now. Trump is saying âyesâ to Fox News almost every day but saying ânoâ to most other major networks and news organizations â a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into âFox & Friendsâ on Monday morning, he is booked on âThe OâReilly Factorâ Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidateâs exposure to hard-hitting questions â while fueling frustration among journalists. At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts wonât ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isnât challenged â and thatâs the way he wants it. The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isnât reaching out. It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in âswingâ districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted. On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney âlandslideâ the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

923,"Monday evening during the presidential debates, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to reinstate “stop-and-frisk,” using New York City as an example of how effective it was in in eradicating crime. Responding to Lester Holt assertion that “stop and frisk” was ruled unconstitutional, Donald Trump said, “No, you’re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.” Fact Check: Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional and was neither lawful nor effective. The program, in which police officers arbitrarily decide when to stop and question a pedestrian, then frisk them for weapons and other contraband, was found to be unlawful after evidence provided proved the NYPD engaged in patterns of unconstitutional stops that were more likely to affect African-American and Latino citizens. The program’s defenders claimed high crime rates were the reason behind the disproportionate targeting of minorities, but Jeffrey Fagan at Columbia Law School found after an investigation into the program, that “even if you control for the crime rate, the racial makeup of a precinct is a good predictor of the number of stops” police do in a particular area. “Anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it up,” Fagan says. Others wouldn’t put it that harshly, but the evidence does seem to suggest that stop and frisk is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, purposefully targets communities illegally.    Examining the number of police stops per seizures of illicit goods mapped out by race, it becomes blatantly obvious that not only are African-Americans stopped over 5x more than whites, the disproportionate targeting is ineffective in reducing crime further because it ignores that the numbers suggest there would be more illicit good seizures if police attention was concentrated more appropriately in groups with a lower stop-per-seizure. Moreover, as foreign correspondent for NBC News Katy Tur live-tweeted during the debate, the murder rate in New York City did not drop until after stop-and-frisk was declared unconstitutional and stopped, it also has not risen beyond a level of concern.   ",0,1,0
403,"Washington (CNN)The top Democrats on Congress' intelligence committees boldly blamed Russian intelligence agencies for a series of hacks designed to influence the US presidential election. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking members on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively, released a joint statement on Thursday calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government. ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the US election,"" the Democrats said. ""At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election -- we can see no other rationale for the behavior of the Russians."" Unlike past hedged comments from US lawmakers and officials, the statement was definitive and more forceful than any previous assertions about Russian hacking from top-level government sources. And in tying the hacking directly to Putin and/or senior levels of Russian government, the Democrats were more forceful than the administration or Congress has been in the past. ""We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,"" Schiff and Feinstein said. ""We call on President Putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. Americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. We hope all Americans will stand together and reject the Russian effort."" Kerry delivers blistering attack on Russia at UN Experts have pinpointed Russian government-affiliated hackers as the source of cyberattacks on a number of Democratic political groups, including the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the Russians going by ""Guccifer 2.0."" But analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the Russians to cast doubt on their culpability. Two other hacks -- both of state election boards -- have also been loosely tied to potential Russian hackers. In Illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and Arizona was also targeted. Though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe Russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. Schiff and Feinstein did not explain what in their briefings led to their conclusion. Intelligence Committee members receive classified briefings they can't speak about in public. They also broke with the administration in their condemnation of Russia. The White House has referred to the beliefs of experts on the hacks, but have not discussed any conclusions drawn by US government investigators. The administration has also been navigating a tense relationship with Russia over the conflict in Syria, with both sides pointing fingers over a fraught ceasefire agreement."" No Republicans joined their statement. The hacks have been perceived as a benefit to GOP nominee Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump has spoken favorably of Putin in the past, and Democrats have tried to paint him as friendly to the authoritarian leader. The hacks have been damaging to the Democratic Party, leading to the resignation of then-Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz on the eve of the Democratic convention in July. In return, Democrats have asked Republicans to not use material from the hacks due to the suspect Russian involvement. CNN's Nicole Gaouette contributed to this report.",1,0,0
107,"The city of Flint, Michigan is suffering through a horrible man-made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state Republicans hadnât been so careless. After placing Flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the cityâs drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption. As a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water. Understandably, Flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. But because Michigan Republicans and Governor Rick Snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping Flint of the power to sue. According to the : Though Flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since April 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member Receivership Transition Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder. The board moved quickly to change the rules under which Flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board. This is absolutely outrageous. Itâs like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose CEO raped her. Michigan Republicans should not have the power to take away anyoneâs right to seek redress through the court system. It sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. And frankly, they should be. After all, it was their decisions that led to Flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. The city of Flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. But Republicans took that power away from Flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way. ",0,1,0
873,"Once again, Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s fear-mongering about immigrants is proven false. Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points – vilifying Syrian refugees. “These attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country” yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th. He later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: “Think of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. It’s sickness, and it’s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.” In fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen – and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the man’s face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do. He called the cops. “I did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thing…I’m from Sikh faith. I’ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution” said Bains to CNN’s Chris Cuomo. He’s absolutely right – because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because they’re Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low.  Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.  The chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains’ actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would. For instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateen’s radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaign’s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America – not refugee or immigrants.",0,1,0

Kiev (CNN)He was one of the most effective legislators in Washington, an icon of Democratic politics. Now Barney Frank says the left has been outmaneuvered by the tea party and the populist right. ""To my great regret, the tea party movement has had much more impact on American politics than Occupy Wall Street,"" Frank, former congressman from Massachusetts, said to David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. ""Because the tea party people correctly understood that, for them, what they needed to do was to get control of the political machinery, to register people to vote, to vote in primaries, and influence public policy,"" Frank continued. ""Occupy Wall Street decided that they would bring about great change by smoking pot and having drum circles, and it turns out voting in primaries is a better way to do it."" The key to bringing about political change, Frank believes, is not allowing one's ideals to overwhelm the sense of moral duty inherent in public service. ""I do believe that, clearly, idealism comes first. You don't belong trying to run other people's lives unless you're committed to ideals,"" Frank said. ""But the more idealistic you are, the more morally you are obligated to be pragmatic."" Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle The conversation with Frank was taped in Kiev around the Yalta European Strategy conference, at which Frank and Axelrod participated in a panel discussion on the American election. During his more than 30 years in Congress, Frank had been involved in some of Washington's most consequential policy debates, including the bipartisan federal bailout of the financial industry in 2008 and the subsequent Dodd-Frank financial reform and consumer protection legislation enacted in 2010. Frank, who retired from Congress in 2013, says he can't help but feel somewhat pessimistic when he reflects on the deterioration of bipartisanship in Washington and the legislative paralysis it has spawned. However, if Hillary Clinton is elected president, then Frank, a staunch supporter of her candidacy, is cautiously hopeful that our nation's political gridlock will lessen. ""If Hillary Clinton wins, one of the benefits, I hope, will be that the Republicans will take their party back. That's all that needs to happen,"" Frank said. ""You don't need huge changes. You just need conservatives who believe in governance arguing with liberals who believe in governance.""

This time he lectured the attendees at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. What did he lecture them about? Hillary. Yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn’t vote for Hillary. Here’s what he said: “My name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There’s no such thing as a vote that doesn’t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote!”   We definitely want to give you a sendoff Mr. President. And it can’t be soon enough. But this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. Get over it. If not voting for Hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many Americans of every color who will not be voting for Hillary. And your legacy? You’ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you’ve implemented. No one needs to help you insult your legacy, it’s a mess. The Democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. But the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they MUST vote for.

799,"Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He is after all a well known Hollywood conservative which is hard to come by.   The actor said Donald Trump is, “on to something because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That’s the kiss-ass generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a p***y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.” He went on, “When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he continued. “And then when I did ‘Gran Torino’ even my associate said, ‘This is a really good script, but it’s politically incorrect.’ And I said, ‘Good. Let me read it tonight.’ The next morning, I came in and I threw it on his desk and I said, ‘We’re starting this immediately.’” Well tell us how you really feel Clint! It appears that perhaps, if even in the least bit, that Clint Eastwood and Donald Trump have something in common. They certainly have no filter. Eastwood did say in his statement that he believes Donald Trump occasionally steps out of line. Specifically Trump’s comments about a Mexican judge being unfit to do his job because Trump made derogatory comments about Mexican’s and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result. But he brushes it off as saying that Trump is simply stating what is on his mind. The icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference, “I’d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody—instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don’t spend what you don’t have. That’s why we’re in the position we are in right now. That’s why people are saying, ‘Why should I work? I’ll get something for nothing, maybe.’” He has made headlines over some of his comments about the Republican nominee. When people called Donald Trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already. He made sure to add a curse word in their for effect. One of his biggest criticisms of Hillary Clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests. Which honestly is not entirely inaccurate. Eastwood’s political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of Hollywood. Hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals. You cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status, power, fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes. Eastwood is one of the few A list celebrities who is conservative. Most others are barely known and don’t do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments. Just look at Mel Gibson and Stacey Dash. It is always nice to hear an A lister speak their conservative opinions. Because they are one of the Hollywood elite. Thus, they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed. Certainly not the man, the myth, the legend, Clint Eastwood. ",0,0,1

1143,"Attorney General Loretta Lynch publicly questioned the wisdom of broad-based stop-and-frisk policies as a crime-fighting tool Thursday, in the wake of comments from Donald Trump urging use of the technique to cut down on gun violence. Asked about her views on the practice, Lynch said she would not be drawn into debate about comments made by political candidates, but she clearly disagreed with the GOP presidential nominee by insisting that the use of the tactic had been counterproductive in New York City. ""In New York … that practice was implemented in a way that was not helpful to community trust and to, frankly, public safety and enhancing the relationship between law enforcement and community members,"" Lynch said in response to question from POLITICO at a press conference about a crackdown on mail-fraud schemes. ""The issue with stop-and-frisk in the New York area was the widespread indiscriminate use of that practice, particularly when it was not generating success from a law enforcement perspective, in either leads or tips or firearms, and the resulting lack of trust that it generated,"" the attorney general said. In an interview Wednesday, Trump called for broader use of stop-and-frisk and specifically praised its success in combating crime in New York. ""I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago,"" Trump said in Cleveland during a taping of Fox News' ""Hannity "" ""I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked. And, we had a very good mayor. But New York City was incredible the way that worked. So, I think that would be one step you could do."" Use of the proactive technique, promoted by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has long angered many civil rights activists. In 2013, a judge in New York ruled that it had been carried out in an unconstitutional, racially discriminatory manner. An appeals court halted that ruling, but while the appeal was pending, the city — under new Mayor Bill de Blasio —wound up settling the case. In comments Thursday, Trump revised his earlier remarks, insisting he was only advocating the practice in murder-plagued Chicago. “I was really referring to Chicago with stop-and-frisk,” he told “Fox and Friends” during a phone interview Thursday morning. “They asked me about Chicago and I was talking about stop-and-frisk for Chicago.” Chicago has seen a spike in murders and shootings, with over 500 killings in 2016 and three months still to go in the year. ""I think Chicago needs stop-and-frisk,” Trump said. “Now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about Chicago, and I think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. But you have to do something. It can’t continue the way it’s going.” Lynch, who spent two stints as chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn before being nominated as attorney general, said she wasn't opposed to stop-and-frisk techniques under certain circumstances. ""As with every police procedure we want to empower law enforcement to be responsive to community needs. We want to empower them to protect the community. We want to give them the training they need in order to do it in a way that is constitutional, safe and effective and promotes trust,"" Lynch said. ""It’s not really a yes or no answer.""

1379,"Sharia law is one of the greatest evils of mankind and women are overwhelmingly the subject of this evil. Yet somehow, so-called “feminists” turn a completely blind eye to it. Women can be oppressed and victimized with not even a peep about the injustice of it all. The latest example that will surely not bother today’s feminists comes out of Turkey, where a woman was kicked in the face by a man for committing the crime of wearing shorts. The kicker is that a Turkish court declared that he had done nothing wrong. 23 year-old Ayşegül Terzi works as a nurse in Istanbul and she was riding a bus when her attire caused a Muslim man on board to fly into a rage. So, he did what comes naturally — for Muslim men who follow Sharia law anyway. He violently attacked her, kicking her in the face while screaming, “Those wearing shorts must die!”   Three other men tried to step in and stop the attack. The entire brouhaha was also caught on camera. The 35 year-old man responsible was caught and he confessed to everything. He admitted to police that he attacked the woman, saying, “The shorts she was wearing were not appropriate. That’s why I was angry and behaved so.” Insanely, the Turkish court agreed with him. He was released when the court found that he had done nothing wrong. And while American pretend feminists couldn’t care less about the plight of Turkish women who live in fear and oppression, actual feminists in Turkey have been speaking out about the violence against women. Hundreds of women are killed every year, many times by their husbands.   But of course, why should anyone worry about things like spontaneous violent attacks because of the clothes women are wearing, or the systemic abuse and even murder of wives by their husbands? Clearly, that’s not real oppression. Real oppression is what women in the United States go through, because they have to wait a day or two before they can get an abortion and they have to pay for it themselves. And sometimes, on college campuses, people say things that women don’t like. Why is everyone so worried about Muslim women when it’s American women that have the real problems… right, feminists? This is why modern feminism is such a joke. These harpies whine about utterly inconsequential garbage, while actual women are suffering. They should really be ashamed. ",0,0,1

503,"Well over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates. According to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live. Many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web. Nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers. This means the actual total audience is even higher. On the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks. NBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC. ABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million. The debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo. Trump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate. The debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election. More recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers. Detailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate. The vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday. Earlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high Anticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million. There will be two more debates between the candidates in October. On Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the ""most tweeted debate ever."" Given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well. Various live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people. On both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the ""final share of conversation around the candidates on stage"" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton. On Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%. Being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate. Still, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage. CNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.",1,0,0
198,"Defending Donald Trump is no easy task, but even his most prominent campaign members are struggling to make sense of his behavior and comments. When MSNBCâs had campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on board to talk ahead of the Monday night debate between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Trumpâs righthand woman couldnât have been any more defensive and avoidant. In all honesty, she failed miserably to make her candidate look good, and choked under the pressure. Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin, who was also a guest on with Conway, asked the Trump campaign manager about Trump falsely accusing the debate moderator, NBCâs Lester Holt, of being a Democrat. He asked: âHe said Lester Holt was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and white factually incorrect?â It was a fair question, and Conway wasnât ready for it. Her response was basically that Trump was not a liar; he just spoke without knowing the truth. Conway responded: âI donât know that he knew what Lester Holtâs voter registration is.â Halperin wasnât letting it go. He pressed Conway, repeating back to her what sheâd just said:Â âWithout knowing then, he asserted he was a Democrat?â Conway then tried to use one of her bossâ favorite interview tactics â dancing around questions. She fired back: âFirst of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats, thatâs false.â At this point, Halperin is getting frustrated and tries to keep Conway focused. He points out just exactly what was wrong in Trumpâs comments about Holt: âIâm asking about a very specific thing.Â He made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. And itâs a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.â Again, instead of responding, Conway began talking about the backlash NBCâs Matt Lauer received after being âtoo niceâ to Trump. It then becomes obvious that Mika Bzrezinki is also losing her patience, when she says, âThis is a filibusterâ while Conway rants on. Halperin once again tries to bring the conversation back: âYouâre not answering what I asked you.Â Iâm asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that?â âHe shouldnât have assertedâ he didnât say, âI donât know what he is, but I think heâs biased,â he said heâs a Democrat.â Conway left this topic again to attack Hillary Clinton and the media, andÂ Brzezinski had to refocusÂ her by saying,Â âI donât understand what that has to do with Markâs question. We were asking why he lied about Lester Holt.â Conway finally says, âI donât think he liedâ andÂ Brzezinski corrected her,Â âUm, I think he did.â Conway then gave this moronic reply: âMika, a lie would mean he knew the manâs party registration.â Co-host Joe Scarborough had to cut the conversation short, but not before an exasperated Halperin could ask,Â âSo as president, would he say things that are false without knowing the truth?â You can watch the interview below: .@KellyannePolls: Trump âdidnât lieâ about Lester Holt, âa lie would mean that he knew the manâs party registrationâ https://t.co/dZWTCwpoim â Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 26, 2016  ",0,1,0
1209,"Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday. That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father. Story Continued Below 1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.” “The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’” 2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward” Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.” “It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said. 3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully” “Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said. “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.” 4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women” Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested, were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.” 5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky” In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.” 6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth” Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added: “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.” 7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said “I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said. 8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer” Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered: “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’ And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.” 9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family “I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump. Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.",1,0,0
545,"The scramble to cover-up the Hillary email scandal has come to light. The Platte River IT executives were not ignorant to what was going on. As subcontractors, they tried to distance themselves from what was going on. One executive call it; Hillary’s cover-up operation. It is astonishing that the FBI and the whole of the Justice Department were unable (unwilling) to see this. Read more below.  As Written By Isabel Vincent and Melissa Klein for The New York Post: Computers from China and Russia tried to attack Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server, according to never-released e-mails from the Denver company that set up and maintained the system. And other internal e-mails show the IT executives fretted about being ordered to purge e-mails and scrambled to distance themselves from what they believed was the former first lady “covering up some shaddy [shady] s- -t.” In a gallows-humor message, one called it “Hillary’s coverup operation.” The FBI in July chastised Clinton and her aides over the use of the private server, saying, “They were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” But the agency declined to recommend charges. The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into Clinton’s server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on Clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct‐-Feb? . . .

1501,"Ken E. Nwadike Jr. is part of the much talked about Free Hugs Project. According to the group, they try to be separate in their approach to getting there and explain it as “an initiative that spreads love, inspires change and raises awareness of social issues through motivational videos.”  He’s been a very busy bee this year and who would’ve guessed? That was a joke…he’s been to each party’s rallies and shown the way to healing through love. Now I’m no smelly hippie, but from what I’ve witnessed so far, this movement can go a long ways in changing hearts and minds to peace. Yet, when Nwadike decided to visit Charlotte during the riots and hugged members of the Charlotte Police Department last night, all hell broke loose with the protesters on the other side of the picket line. Nwadike was called a phrase that we won’t repeat in print…by protesters who seemed to be just shocked that he was actually switching ‘sides’ and hugging law enforcement that were posted up at the scene. He then tried to do something rioters are sorely known for and that is ‘reason’ with a few, but to no avail. He stated firmly that he is neither on the side of the cops, nor BLM…but that he is for peace and is staying neutral. He then gives the most reasoned and simple example of how we need to put things into perspective and tells one protester that an officer’s uniform doesn’t make him a killer, or a robot, just like how his (pointing to the man) skin color doesn’t make him a criminal. We are all just brothers and sisters. “This man [pointing to the officer] gave me a hug, and he wants to fight me because of that; how does that make sense spreading more hate into the world?” Nwadike yelled over the crowd. “That’s what’s frustrating me, we can’t love one another?” Nwadike then stated “If I couldn’t find work, if I was not blessed to have a job, guess what I would do—I would join the military, I would be a police officer—I would find work in order to feed my children,” Nwadike is incredibly reasoned and wise, and will no doubt, play a major role in healing this nation from hate.

At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate. But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?  According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.” But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

285,"Washington (CNN)Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid offered an explanation Tuesday for why Donald Trump won't disclose his tax returns: the Republican presidential nominee is ""faking his net worth."" The Nevada Democrat -- and frequent Trump foe -- levied the charge on Twitter, evoking a similar claim he made against the GOP's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. ""Trump is faking his net worth. He's not as rich as he would have us believe + a bad businessman. That's why we can't see his tax returns,"" Reid tweeted. Reid, citing an unnamed source, memorably accused Romney during the 2012 race of going 10 years without paying federal income taxes. Romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 through 2009, and his tax returns from 2010 and 2011. But he did not release additional returns. The Trump campaign did not return CNN's request for comment. Reid on Tuesday then went to the Senate floor to rip into Trump. ""The last thing the American people want or need is a president who will run another financial scam on each of them,"" the Nevada Democrat said. ""If elected, Donald Trump would be the scammer in chief. Trump is a fraud."" ""He's always looking for a mark, some victim for one of his schemes,"" Reid added. ""And now our country is Trump's next target. He wants this to be his biggest payoff ever."" Reid's speech focused what he sees as lies about Trump's money and said the real estate mogul is only wealthy because he was born with ""a silver spoon."" Trump's father was a wealthy real estate magnate who loaned his son money to jumpstart his career. ""Litigation is nothing new to Donald Trump. Over the last decade and a half, Trump and his companies and have been sued in federal court 72 times. That doesn't take into consideration the many times he's been sued in state courts,"" Reid said. ""But Trump being the flim-flammer he is just moves on to another scam."" Reid, who is supporting Hillary Clinton, has repeatedly attacked Trump this campaign. Following Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, Reid attacked Trump's health. ""Take a look at this character that's running for president. He complains about her health. What does he do? He's 70 years old. He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit,"" Reid said last week. And on Thursday, Reid tore into Trump on the Senate floor, calling the Republican presidential nominee a ""spoiled brat,"" ""a con artist"" and a ""human leech who will bleed the country."" ",1,0,0

She doesn't have the stamina, I said she doesn't have the stamina, and I don't believe she does have the stamina,"" Trump said. Fact checking the debate The debate moderator, NBC's Lester Holt, asked Trump to clarify what he meant when he said earlier this month that his Democratic rival didn't have ""a presidential look."" Trump's women problem ""I just don't believe she has a presidential look, and you need a presidential look,"" Trump had told ABC News' David Muir in an interview. Clinton responded: ""As soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina."" The most memorable one-liners from the debate Clinton, the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major political party in US history, pointed out Trump pivoted from saying she doesn't look like a presidential candidate to saying she doesn't have the stamina.

500,"Washington (CNN)Former ""Miss Universe"" Alicia Machado said she cried when she heard Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton talk about her during the first presidential debate at Hofstra University Monday. ""Well, last night I was with my family, with my mom and with my daughter, we were watching the debate and you know, I was really surprised,"" she said in Spanish during a phone call with reporters set up by the Clinton campaign. ""And I started crying. I started crying because I never imagined that such an important person like her would care about my story, know about my story."" Machado was referencing a moment during the debate when Clinton slammed Donald Trump's for his past comments toward women -- which has become a key campaign issue that hits on his vulnerabilities with both Hispanics and women. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton had said. She continued: ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" Trump, seemingly caught off-guard, repeatedly interjected: ""Where did you find this?"" Clinton, according to aides, had been prepped on Machado's story going into the debate and aimed to use it as a way to counter sexism on Trump's part. The Democratic nominee's campaign quickly turned the exchange into what they hoped would be a lasting moment: They published a video about the former beauty pageant winner shortly after the debate, in addition to holding the press call. ""I lament that I could be an uncomfortable person for Mr. Trump, but that's how things were,"" Machado said in the phone call. ""And I know very well what's he's capable of, this man. And that's why I am fighting to make the community understand, now more than ever, that Latinos need to support the US, that we need to return all the beautiful and grand things the US has provided for us."" When asked how the back-and-forth has played with Spanish speaking media, a Clinton aide had a one-word response: ""H-U-G-E."" On Tuesday, Trump refused to back down from his criticism of Machado, telling ""Fox and Friends"" in an interview that Machado had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem."" ""She was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem,"" Trump said. ""Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl -- this was many years ago. And found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Theresa. And it wasn't quite that way but that's OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do."" Beauty queen encouraged to lose weight Machado competed and won the ""Miss Universe"" title representing Venezuela in 1996 when she was 19 years old -- but then she gained nearly 60 pounds, according to a CNN report at the time. ""Some people when they have pressure eat too much. Like me. Like Alicia,"" Trump said at the time. He was then executive producer of the Miss Universe Pageant. In 1997, rumors surfaced that Machado would be forced to give up her Miss Universe crown -- but Trump said he wouldn't let it happen, according to the CNN report. ""We had a choice of: termination or do this,"" he said at the time. ""We wanted to do this."" By ""this,"" he meant encourage her to lose weight. Machado told Inside Edition in May that she actually gained closer to 15 pounds and that Trump called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she is Latina, and ""Miss Piggy."" It made her feel ""so fat"" that it made her ""very depressed,"" she said. Trump told the New York Times that he pushed her to lose weight. ""To that, I will plead guilty,"" he said."" But Machado said that she was affected by the comments. ""After that episode, I was sick, had anorexia and bulimia for five years,"" she said.

A pair of cyberattacks on Illinois' and Arizona's voter registration databases over the summer spurred the Obama administration to ring the alarm bells for states as they prepare for what has already been a chaotic campaign. And top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees publicly accused the Russian government of seeking to alter the election. ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, said Thursday. Russian intelligence agencies behind US election hacks, lawmakers say Cybersecurity experts say the prospect of ""rigging"" the election, and changing the outcome, is practically impossible. Elections are decentralized: 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, run their own operations, not to mention the thousands of counties across the country that play a major role at the local level. Different jurisdictions use different voting machines, It isn't plausible for hackers to breach them all in one fell swoop -- penetrating one election system in North Carolina has no impact on Colorado. Furthermore, most voting machines aren't connected to the Internet, which inoculates them from outside intrusions. But hackers could still cause plenty of havoc in November, with attacks on registration systems or government websites reporting the results on election night. Many news organizations pull their results from those sites. ""Think about the chaos you could cause if you get one TV network calling the election for one candidate, and another network calling the election for the other,"" said Professor Herbert Lin, a cybersecurity expert at Stanford University. ""If your intent is to sow doubt and uncertainty, at least in the short term, affecting the media reporting could be really problematic."" DHS running 'Cyber hygiene scans' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is the Obama administration's point man on election security, holding meetings with elections officials from across the country, and offering help to states that are interested. DHS is offering ""cyber hygiene scans"" that will remotely search for vulnerabilities in election systems like online voter registration systems and election night reporting infrastructure. It is also offering to send cybersecurity experts to states so they can conduct more aggressive in-person testing the final weeks of the campaign. Johnson recently laid out other federal resources for states in a memo last week, including a 24/7 center to respond to cyberattacks, and a list of ""best practices"" on how to secure voter registration databases. Pennsylvania has accepted the DHS help, both the remote scans and the in-person testing, said Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren. Election authorities in Ohio are also accepting federal help. But not every state is happy to have the administration involved. Georgia's secretary of state publicly scoffed at these efforts and accused the federal government of trying to ""subvert the Constitution."" Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, rebuffed the idea, telling Nextgov that the feds might want to ""subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security."" However, his office later walked back the comment, saying they were not flatly refusing the assistance. A call for comment from Kemp was not immediately returned Thursday. Florida officials, whose recount debacle in 2000 led to the federal law which ultimately created voter registration databases, declined to say whether they were accepting help from DHS, citing security concerns. What are the threats? Perhaps the most serious vulnerability is the integrity of voter registration systems. Hackers can break in and delete or alter individual voter registration records, creating confusion on Election Day when voters show up to their polling place and their names are mysteriously missing from the rolls, or their address is changed. This summer, hackers broke into a stash of information for about 90,000 voters in Illinois, breaching a database with voters' names, addresses, sex and birthdays. And officials in Arizona took their voter registration system offline after they learned that a Russian hacker had breached their systems. Once hackers penetrate a voter registration system, ""the scope could be whatever they want,"" said Cathie Brown, who served as Virginia's deputy chief information security officer and is a cybersecurity expert with Impact Makers. ""Deleting an entire precinct of voters -- that's absolutely possible. The grander the scope, the more likely they'll get caught. But they might not get caught until after they've done the damage."" But at least one expert said that state elections directors have been dealing with technological threats for a long time. ""The state and local election officials, this whole notion of security is not new to them this is something they deal with all the time,"" said Tim Mattice, executive director of the Elections Center, which trains state and local elections officials on administering elections. Mattice's organization works with the professional group representing election officials, the National Association of State Election Directors. Mattice said that when DHS offered up help, most people understood them when they said they were making it voluntary and did not want to be viewed as coming in and taking over state-run elections. Ironically, Mattice noted that the focus on technological security got serious after Congress passed the national Help America Vote Act in the wake of the 2000 elections, which mandated that states develop integrated voter registration systems -- effectively placing all the voter data in systems that could be hacked. Asked how hackers got through in Illinois and Arizona despite the layers of security that elections officials already have in place, Mattice said it's the same problem any organization or business faces. ""You could ask Target how they got hacked -- these hackers are getting sophisticated,"" Mattice said. ",1,0,0
1089,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu poked fun at President Barack Obama’s golf obsession Wednesday as he extended an invitation to the president to visit him in Israel. “As you conclude your presidency, I know you’re gonna be busy with many, many things — much more than improving what I hear is a terrific golf game,” Netanyahu said to Obama, as the two appeared before the media, with a backdrop of American and Israeli flags, after meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. “Your voice, your influential voice, will be heard for many decades, and I know you’ll continue to support Israel's right to defend itself and its right to thrive as a Jewish state.” Story Continued Below “So I want you to know, Barack, that you’ll always be a welcome guest in Israel,” the prime minister continued. “And, by the way, I don’t play golf, but right next to my home in Caesarea in Israel is a terrific golf course.” Obama responded in jest, remarking as they shook hands that the pair will “set up a tee time.” “I guarantee you I will visit Israel often because it is a beautiful country with beautiful people, and Michelle and the girls, I think, resent the fact that I have not taken them on most of these trips,” Obama added. “So they’re insistent that I do take them, of course. They will appreciate the fact that the next time I visit Israel I won’t have to sit in bilats but instead can enjoy the sights and sounds of a remarkable country.” While the two heads of state have a strained relationship, both were all smiles Wednesday as they touted the “unbreakable” bond the U.S. shares with Israel. “As Prime Minister Netanyahu mentioned, the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable,” Obama said. “It is based on common values, family ties, a recognition that a Jewish state of Israel is one of our most important allies and a guiding principle throughout my presidency. One that I’ve expressed often to the prime minister is that it is important for America’s national security to ensure that we have a safe and secure Israel, one that can defend itself.”",1,0,0
918,"During tonight’s debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he received a “small loan” from his father to begin his business career. That “small loan” was for over a million dollars, and his father continued to give him financial backing throughout the early years of his career. His “success” is proof of the adage that you “need money to make money,” as he borrowed $14 million from his father and received a blind trust fund which gave him another million. Trump complained to POLITICO that “It has not been easy for me. It has not been easy for me. I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,” Trump remarked. “I came into Manhattan, and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great.” Yes, poor Trump spent his early years in expensive boarding schools and was given start-up money for his “business” career, the success of which has been questionable at best, given his multiple bankruptcies. It’s hard to imagine anyone more representative of the selfish excesses of wealthy America or be more disconnected from the struggles of everyday Americans. It’s mind-boggling to understand how anyone can pretend this man cares or even understands the problems facing the American middle class.  ",0,1,0
111,"In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States, weâre pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties. Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court. Itâs imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but thatâs never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits. This yearâs election is so criticalÂ not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy. Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of , Seth MacFarlane. MacFarlane tweeted: âRemember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year!â Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year! â Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) September 19, 2016  His sarcasm is more a terrifying wake-up call than just witty banter on the Twitter machine. Does this mean you shouldnât vote for Stein or Johnson? No, of course not. However, it needs to be brought to peopleâs attention that their vote for a third party isnât actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump. A âconscience voteâ does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day. So, do what you do. Thatâs your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world. ",0,1,0
1192,"Ted Cruz on Friday said he would vote for Donald Trump for president and that he would encourage others to do the same, reversing months of opposition to his bitter primary rival. ""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. Story Continued Below Cruz said he endorsed both because of his primary pledge to support the party nominee, as well as his concerns about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. ""Last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word,"" Cruz said. ""Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable — that’s why I have always been #NeverHillary."" A Trump adviser said Trump and Cruz spoke after the endorsement. For months, Cruz had avoided endorsing Trump, his primary foe in an intensely personal race. People close to him were sharply divided on Friday over the decision, hours before he made his endorsement. “If he announces he endorses, it destroys his political brand,” said someone who had worked for Cruz's campaign. Steve Deace, a prominent conservative Iowa radio host who was a major Cruz backer, also tweeted Friday that the senator would endorse Trump. A spokeswoman for Cruz did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ""This is gonna be a political disaster,"" Deace texted after Cruz made his decision official. ""Sad. Unavoidable. Entirely self inflicted."" Trump responded in a statement that he was ""greatly honored"" by the nod. ""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent,"" Trump said. ""I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."" Cruz had previously gone as far as to tell Republicans to “vote your conscience” at the Republican National Convention, rather than urging them to get behind the nominee. Since then, Cruz, who may face a primary challenge in his 2018 Senate reelection campaign, has come under mounting pressure to get behind Trump, though many Cruz loyalists see an endorsement as unacceptable. At the outset of the Republican primary, Cruz went out of his way to praise Trump, expecting that the real estate mogul’s support would crumble, and Cruz would be the beneficiary. But as the primary continued and Trump moved into an increasingly strong position in the race, Cruz sought to fashion himself as the conservative alternative to Trump, repeatedly describing his opponent as a liberal who had few differences with Hillary Clinton. The race turned increasingly personal between the two, with Trump attacking Cruz’s wife and seeking to link Cruz’s father to conspiracy theories about assassinating former President John F. Kennedy. On the day that he dropped out of the race, Cruz took his criticism of Trump to a new level, accusing him of being a “pathological liar,” a “serial philanderer” and an “utterly amoral” “bully.” The personal differences between the two of them, as well as Trump’s willingness to flaunt conservative orthodoxy that many Cruz loyalists embrace, has made supporting the nominee a nonstarter for many of the senator’s most committed backers. But slowly, other conservative leaders, including many who backed Cruz in the primary, have gotten on board with Trump, and have made clear publicly that Cruz should do the same. They view the election as a binary election between Hillary Clinton and Trump, rather than accepting the more nuanced stance that Cruz took at the convention. “I think he should give a nod of support,” said Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, who was previously an important Cruz backer. “I think a lot of folks that supported Ted feel that way. Given the choices before us, yeah, I would like to see Ted give his support to Trump at this point.” The initial calculation at the RNC from many who backed Cruz’s decision was that, assuming Trump went up in flames in November, Cruz would emerge from the election respected as one of the last principled conservatives, willing to serve as the final bulwark against a candidate who violated many of the values conservatives hold dear. Supporting Trump would tie Cruz’s fortunes more closely to his, a possible complication for Cruz, whose fans have long wanted him to look at running for president again in 2020. But there is a more urgent need to attend to: Cruz’s unwillingness to support Trump has become an issue in his home state as he prepares for Senate re-election. The morning after he refused to support Trump at the RNC, the Texas delegation breakfast broke out into chaos as delegates split over whether or not Cruz should support the nominee. Since then, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), a possible Cruz primary challenger for Cruz’s Senate seat, has been using the senator’s unwillingness to support Trump as a means of attacking Cruz. McCaul attacked Cruz on the Laura Ingraham Show this week for breaking his pledge to support the nominee, declaring he was “very angry” about the dissension. “He broke his word,” said McCaul, the wealthy chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. The Texas senator has been gradually making moves to soothe his often poor relations with fellow senators since his primary loss, helping raise money for at-risk Republicans and donating $100,000 to the Senate GOP’s campaign arm. But many Republicans on Capitol Hill have prodded him to go further and hold his nose with an endorsement. While several Republicans said Cruz’s bloc of conservative voters could make the difference for Trump, others said any endorsement would be more about helping secure Cruz’s own political standing than Trump’s. “I don’t think endorsements matter,” said one Republican senator. Agreed Perkins, “At this point, I think it’s probably more beneficial to Ted than it is to Trump, to show that Ted is a team player. And look, there’s a lot of folks, like myself, [for whom] Donald Trump was not our first choice. But he is working hard to gain the support and confidence of conservatives, and the alternative is clear.” Of people close to Cruz who disagree with any indication of support for Trump, some say that voting for Trump — but attempting to distinguish between a vote and an endorsement, as senators such as Kelly Ayotte have done — might be forgivable. But a full-on endorsement, especially one that would entail campaigning for the Republican nominee, would be harder to stomach. Cruz’s move toward his former rival takes away the most prominent anti-Trump holdout in Congress, leaving Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Mike Lee of Utah as the remaining senators who either oppose or haven’t supported Trump. Few have shown any inclination to follow Cruz’s lead. “I’m against Hillary Clinton for president, that’s where I am,” Heller said Thursday. “We’ll go through the debate and see how it plays out.” Lee, Cruz’s strongest defender and closest friend in the Senate, indicated he has no plans to follow Cruz’s lead. In a statement, Lee said he is watching “each candidate's grasp of — and willingness to work tirelessly to restore — federalism and separation of powers. “I am always eager to support any candidate willing to make those structural constitutional protections a priority. In this race and in every other, I will continue to use the same criteria,” Lee said. But Trump has made some overtures to Lee, on Friday including him on a list of his potential choices for a Supreme Court nomination. Lee was not interested. Asked about a possible endorsement of Trump, Jason Johnson, Cruz’s chief strategist on the campaign, responded with what appeared to be a photo of himself, with his hand over his face.

46,"Former President Bill Clinton slowly walked toward the podium, newly repositioned at the center of the stage under the spotlight. He diligently thumbed through the pages of a farewell defense, which he had been working on moments before he addressed the Clinton Global Initiative one final time. “It’s been one of the great honors of my life,” Clinton said as he addressed crowd. “You are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows. Now, I have spent the last 15 years of my life working to advance that idea.”   Emails released by the State Department show that some Clinton Foundation donors received meetings with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which prompted Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to accuse the Clinton Foundation of being a “pay for play” organization.       But Bill Clinton today shied away from engaging in the politics surrounding his foundation and instead used his platform as an attempt to change the negative narrative that has been seen as a liability to his wife’s presidential bid. Clinton proudly recalled trips around the world, partnering with governments, corporations and influential people to deliver HIV/AIDS medication, fight childhood obesity and provide homes for Haitian families following the devastating 2010 earthquake, among countless other initiatives. The CGI Annual Meeting runs at the same time at the United Nations General Assembly, hoping to attract world leaders who can only attend if they pledge to commit to a cause. “Everybody who comes has to actually make a commitment to do something to make the world a better place. We won’t say there’s a minimum dollar amount, we won’t say there’s a minimum time amount, but they got to do something,” explained the former president. And then he joked, “And I thought we’re about to have a meeting and nobody will come.” Attendance at the annual meeting has dragged a bit since Hillary Clinton announced her presidential bid, as some donors have tried to keep space between the Clinton Foundation and her run for president. In previous years, President Barack Obama has attended and presidential candidates on both sides have come, but not this year. But Bill Clinton did not allow the scrutiny to keep him from giving CGI members a charge to continue their work, even if it would be without him. “Don't give up on what brought you here. You have done something good and noble and worthy and it’s all just beginning,” said the former president. “If we embrace our common humanity over our interesting differences and get up tomorrow in knowing that just if we get caught trying and we do it with somebody else, chances are it will work out better than it ever dreamed. CGI worked out better than I ever dreamed.” Today’s meeting was the twelfth and final CGI convocation, and Bill Clinton announced last month that he would resign from the board of the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election.",1,0,0
624,"As WikiLeaks reports, the plan was to make Abedin Secretary of State. As President, Hillary Clinton will appoint Huma Abedin as Secretary of State. This according to leaked e mails between Abedin, Mrs. Clinton, and Clinton’s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills. Abedin, 40, would be the first Moslem Secretary of State, and one of the youngest ever. She would not, however, be the first foreign born Secretary of State. Henry Kissinger, 93, has that distinction, having been appointed by Richard Nixon. Huma Mahmood Abedin, 40, served as vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign for President. Prior to that, she served as the deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013. ABedin parlayed a 1996 Whitehouse internship into a role as Mrs. Clinton’s Right Hand Man, or Woman. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is listed as the supervisor certifying Abedin’s designation as a “special government employee. This classification allowed Abedin to work for an outside consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, at the same time that she advised then Secretary of State Clinton. The Clinton campaign reiterated Sunday that Clinton did not personally sign documents for Abedin, or other employees. Hillary Clinton’s name was listed in print, but the signature underneath was redacted by the State Department. The document caused a stir and led to media reports Clinton had lied about not having been involved.. As you can see, the Clintons play “cover your ass” at every turn. They do whatever it takes to get what they need to accomplish without getting their own hands dirty. ",0,0,1

Special Report: US election By Joseph J. Schatz and Benjamin Oreskes 9/22/16, 5:33 AM CET Updated 9/23/16, 9:15 AM CET Hillary Clinton with Barack Obama at the Democratic convention | Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images When Hillary Clinton resigned as U.S. secretary of state in 2013, Beijing wasn’t sorry to see her go. In her four years in office, the former first lady and senator had gained a reputation in China as a source of hostility in an administration that had otherwise tried to be accommodating. In particular, Clinton rankled Beijing by rallying China’s neighbors against its maneuvers in the South China Sea. Shortly after she was succeeded by John Kerry, China’s state-controlled Global Times wrote that “for the Chinese people, the hard line of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been unforgettable.” To fans of Clinton’s tough-minded approach to foreign policy, the description was a badge of honor — and an example of how her approach to the world will differ from U.S. President Barack Obama’s if she is elected in November. “If you ask the Chinese or the Japanese or the Australians, they’ll tell you Clinton is the realist, the balance-of-power person,” said Michael Green, who served as senior director for Asia on George W. Bush’s National Security Council. Green, now senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, briefed Clinton and her team twice on Asian affairs and came away impressed. He is also one of 50 Republican foreign policy experts who signed a letter this summer denouncing the party’s nominee, Donald Trump. Clinton has long described her Iraq vote as a mistake, but she has since taken a series of other stands that have bolstered a reputation for hawkishness. A Clinton White House would undoubtedly provide U.S. foreign policy with a dose of continuity — especially when compared to the wild-card uncertainty of a Trump presidency. But the former top diplomat would also bring an alternative approach to statecraft. And she would also face a different set of domestic and geopolitical limitations, particularly when it comes to trade and the relationship between the U.S. and Europe. Where Obama is cerebral and deliberative, the narrative goes, Clinton does her homework but is quicker to make decisions. Where Obama points out the United States’ historic failings and missteps, Clinton, a child of the Cold War and an advocate of NATO expansion, is firmly in the “American exceptionalism” camp. “I believe we are still Lincoln’s ‘last, best hope of Earth,’” she said in an August 31 speech in Ohio. “We’re still Reagan’s ‘shining city on a hill.’ We’re still Robert Kennedy’s ‘great, unselfish, compassionate country.’” At a time when most Americans seem averse to putting boots on the ground just about anywhere, Clinton’s team has described her approach as “more muscular” than Obama’s — with its reliance on drones and special forces operations — and perhaps better suited to the current international environment. And, of course, there’s the 2002 vote in Congress authorizing military action in Iraq. Her “yes” vote probably cost her the party’s nomination in 2008. Clinton has long described her Iraq vote as a mistake, but she has since taken a series of other stands that have bolstered a reputation for hawkishness. She argued against a drastic drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and supported an intervention in Libya, decisions that put her at odds with many in her party. Clinton has pledged to keep U.S. ground troops out of Syria. Chinese officials are thought to be wary of a Clinton presidency. Her adversarial approach to Beijing dates back to 1995, when, as first lady, she famously said that “women’s rights are human rights” at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. And during her tenure as secretary of state, her team pushed back during bilateral negotiations when Beijing sought to expand the number of issues it deemed to be Chinese “core interests,” along the lines of Tibet and Taiwan. Also On Politico Ryan Heath Also On Politico Ryan Heath Also On Politico Matthew Karnitschnig Also On Politico Janosch Delcker Also On Politico Julia Gillard It is important to note, however, that many of Clinton’s top officials are likely to be holdovers from the current or previous administrations, making sharp breaks in policy unlikely. Her top foreign policy aide and likely national security advisor is Jake Sullivan, who played a key role in the U.S. opening up to Myanmar and advised on the Iran nuclear deal implemented after Clinton left office. Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul has served as a high-profile surrogate when it comes to Russia, and observers expect him to play a role in a Clinton administration. On Asia, former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell, an architect of the Obama administration’s so-called Asia pivot, is likely to play a large role in a Clinton presidency. Many expect to see former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michelle Flournoy, who worked on Russia and Ukraine, in a top job. The biggest difference between Obama and Clinton is likely to be less about military deployments or diplomatic showdowns than about economic policy. Historically, Clinton has been a proponent of free trade. But in the last year, the anti-trade sentiment that helped boost the candidacies of Trump, and Clinton’s primary opponent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, has pushed her to the left on the issue. That could leave her far more constrained than her predecessors, including her husband and Obama, when it comes to trade deals. She’s already disavowed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the free-trade agreement for which she helped lay the groundwork during her time in Foggy Bottom. And her statements on the campaign trail call into question whether she would rush to strike a deal on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which she described as an “economic NATO” in 2012. As with all presidents, however, Clinton’s foreign policy would less likely be governed by grand strategy than by the geopolitical landscape and unfolding events. And the world, to put it lightly, looks different than it did when Clinton last held office. “It’s not the Europe of the Clinton era of the 1990s and it’s not even the Europe of the beginning of the Obama administration” — Fiona Hill, director at the Brookings Institution The war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State have dramatically destabilized the Middle East. China’s president, Xi Jinping, is re-asserting the country’s dominance in East Asia. North Korea is widely believed to be on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon that could threaten the continental United States. Russian President Vladimir Putin has annexed Crimea and is intent on being a player, or at least a spoiler, in Syria — and perhaps in the U.S. elections themselves. But nowhere has the landscape been more drastically altered than Europe. Obama’s detached nature, combined with controversies over the U.S. spying on its allies, left many Europeans disappointed. But since then, much has changed, as a spate of terrorist attacks, a worrying refugee crisis and the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union upended the status quo. “It’s not the Europe of the Clinton era of the 1990s and it’s not even the Europe of the beginning of the Obama administration,” said Fiona Hill, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution and a former national intelligence officer on the National Intelligence Council. The question, experts say, is whether Clinton would see the EU as an ally, or as a problem to be managed. Patrick Cronin, a senior advisor at the Center for a New American Security and a top official at the U.S. Agency for International Development under George W. Bush, expects a greater emphasis by her on personal relationships with EU leaders than Obama. “She’ll be stronger on the transatlantic relationship than Obama was initially,” said Cronin. Added Hill, “Clinton is coming in at a moment where she’s going to have to be much more of a leader with respect to Europe.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

1066,"President Barack Obama and Donald Trump are alike in at least one regard, according to former CIA Director Michael Hayden. ""You know, last week I mentioned there was difference in language between Mr. Trump and President Obama. You know, there's not a whole lot of difference between the Obama administration's retrenchment and Mr. Trump's America First. There are common themes there,"" Hayden said Wednesday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" during a discussion of Obama's final United Nations address. Story Continued Below Hayden, who served as CIA director under George W. Bush from 2006-2009 and briefly under Obama, remarked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that the last Republican president ""probably would have been challenged to make a speech so eloquent as President Obama’s yesterday,"" while adding that Bush ""would have done so much behind the scenes."" ""I sat in the Oval Office. We had a meeting and he would just turn over his shoulder and say, ‘Get me [former Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf.’ He actually worked on the issues and invested his personal energy and I should add personal prestige and political capital in risking that in order to make things different in the world,"" Hayden said. ""And sadly, I just don't think we're seeing much of that in the last half a dozen or eight years."" Former Bush aide Nicolle Wallace offered her own criticism of Obama's speech, noting that she heard from Middle Eastern leaders would likely describe the president's address as ""probably decent and perhaps elegant analysis, but he's not an analyst."" ""What they heard was the complete lack of any connection to any world leaders. He didn't give a speech in that room as though he were in constant contact with anybody else in the room,"" Wallace said. ""He gave a speech as if he never talked to these people, as though the only contact were public ones and that that was so different not just from George W. Bush, who had better private relationships than some of the conflicts that erupted in public, but ... there hasn't been an American president with fewer or weaker relationships with world leaders."" As co-host Joe Scarborough went on to say that history would judge Obama to be a president with few friends on Capitol Hill regardless of party, Wallace chimed in, ""He didn't have any friends.""",1,0,0
1240,"The New York Times on Monday urged undecided voters to rethink their consideration of Donald Trump for president, warning them of supporting a candidate “far more consumed with himself than with the nation’s well-being.” Days after endorsing Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, the newspaper issued a scathing rebuke of the Republican presidential nominee — hours ahead of his first one-on-one debate with Clinton. Story Continued Below In an editorial published Monday, the Times’ editorial board reminds voters that the real estate mogul began his campaign 15 months ago offering “wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a list of fearmongering about Mexican ‘rapists’ flooding across the Southern border.” “From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics,” the board wrote. “Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.” Now is the time for undecided voters — as well as those “hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance,” the board said — “to take a hard look and see Mr. Trump for who he is. They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. Otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nation’s well-being.” From his business “record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures” to his refusal to release his tax returns to his embrace of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and potential business ties to the Kremlin, the Times outlined “how Mr. Trump is selling himself and why he can’t be believed.” The list includes Trump’s waffling on policy issues, his intimation that he might try to persuade creditors to accept less than the U.S. government owes and a tax-cut plan that would cost trillions of dollars in revenue, among others. The Times mocks what it calls his ludicrous secret plan to destroy the Islamic State, noting that Trump has no national security experience and bobs and weaves on whether he would commit ground troops, and insists his heart lies “with the anti-immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base.” “A change agent for the nation and the world?” an italicized subhead reads. “There can be little doubt of that. But voters should be asking themselves if Mr. Trump will deliver the kind of change they want,” the Times cautions. Adding that voters should be wary of Trump’s “silence about areas of national life that are crying out for constructive change,” such as schools, poverty and racial progress, the Times concludes: “Voters attracted by the force of the Trump personality should pause and take note of the precise qualities he exudes as an audaciously different politician: bluster, savage mockery of those who challenge him, degrading comments about women, mendacity, crude generalization about nations and religions. Our presidents are role models for generations of our children. Is this the example we want for them?”",1,0,0
1234,"There is a moment at every Donald Trump rally when Donald Trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he’s created. “Is there any place in America as fun as a Donald Trump rally?” he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming “TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!” That’s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas. “Donald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,” a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally. Story Continued Below When Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn’t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama—“We call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?”—and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they’re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual. His opponent does not. Clinton’s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world’s most famous and polarizing woman, but she’s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual. Tonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven’t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you’re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game—rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency—and when 2016 is over, it’s not clear whether those rules will still apply. Whatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who’s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like “Love Trumps Hate” or “Stronger Together.” The small venues are selected to target niche groups—millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando—and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive. “I thought it was very substantial, very specific,” Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a “Hil Yes!” pin to Clinton’s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. “The purpose wasn’t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We’re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.” Clinton had better hope not. There’s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can’t match. It’s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you’re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It’s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (“It’s 100 degrees in here. And that’s considered cool for an auditorium.”) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell—the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world—then moves onto another before the last fully explodes. Clinton doesn’t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump’s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn’t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic. Nobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton’s campaign, like his accusations that it’s “policy-free,” when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there’s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches—he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long—with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in. “Bom. Bom. Bom. See ya!” Trump smirked. “See ya! I’m going home.” Many Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump’s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he’s shredding every day. *** Before attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I’m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz’s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet. Trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the “bad, dishonest, very bad people” in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word “sir” to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as “a big fat bubble,” and predicted a collapse that would be “beautiful to watch.” He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: “I didn’t put him there! I’m not paying him!” He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself “more militaristic than anyone in this room,” complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year—actually the president’s salary—and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled. “Whoever the hell brought this mic system—don’t pay the son of a bitch!” he seethed. “Don’t pay em. Don’t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn’t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they’ll pay, they don’t care. So we’re not going to pay. I guarantee, I’m not paying for this mic.” So I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola’s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: “Tyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!” The crowd started chanting “LOCK HER UP!” before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and…well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected. “He’s freeing up our speech,” said one Trump supporter. “We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty… Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.” Trump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichés and Republican talking points about “encrusted insiders” and “turning the page.” He said the kind of things regular politicians say: “The history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.” And: “Once again, we’ll have a government of, by, and for the people.” He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd—during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: “What about white people?”—but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall—but really, who still thinks about them? Afterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn’t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing “all the problems in the world,” including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that “personally, I think she’s an unstable person,” and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone “right smack in the middle of the heart—and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, OK?” He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin—and then he had cozied up again: “He’s been nice to me, and if he’s nice to me, that’s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that “the country is collapsing.” Those all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We’re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military “incredibly weak,” defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community—which endured slavery and Jim Crow—was “in the worst shape they’ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!” Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline “Restraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.” Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton’s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn’t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn’t make it through one. That sort of behavior just hasn’t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it’s that defiant you-can’t-tell-me-what-I’m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. “He’s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people’s feelings, always watching our P’s and Q’s, so it’s cool to see him speak his mind,” said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing—he doesn’t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn’t stumble around like she did on the video—Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: “He’ll call a spade a spade, and if you don’t like it you can shove it.” Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs. “He’s freeing up our speech,” said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. “We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we’re offensive. Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.” It’s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off—at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn’t want hate in their state: “Lazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!” He explained to me that America was under siege, with “thousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,” and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered “deplorable.” The Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition—and they seemed less anxious than pissed off. One of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: “We want our state rights back!” “We’re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,” says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don’t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. “Trump is saying what we’re all thinking: ‘Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don’t end where your feelings begin!’” Trump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as “the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.” And he’s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it’s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: “I’ll say it openly, and some people don’t like it, I don’t really care: What do you have to lose?” His long riffs about how he’ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can’t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don’t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent—the real rate is about one third of that—he’s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya—and many I spoke to believe he’s also a Muslim who supports ISIS. One notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. “A lot of us who like him don’t like the stuff he says about race,” Cohen said. “Obviously, some do.” This really isn’t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal—a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams—she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak. I remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it. In 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She’s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn’t been about standard anything. *** Nearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton’s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an “Inclusive Economy,” to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters—a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse—about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton’s concern about a worthy issue. It did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show. “I thought it was a nice speech,” Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. “Not very exciting, but I believe she’ll do what she says.” The speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer’s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators. The rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: “Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.” Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. “In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,” Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value. Clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children’s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department’s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she’s known—including the “unbelievably good-looking” actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that “family values” should mean that every family has value—and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the “sub-minimum wage” that is currently paid to some disabled workers. The audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a “really slow, vicious death” to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn’t feel bad if they’re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton’s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton’s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn’t even mention Trump’s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics. Geannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter. “Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.” In fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down’s Syndrome and lead a productive life. “What Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,” Kilsheimer said. “I know a lot of people don’t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she’s got heart.” Geannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton’s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. “Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.” Political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they’re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren’t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it’s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump’s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. “My daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We’ve got plenty to lose,” said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. “There’s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.” Many Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump’s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. “He thinks we’re all Mexicans, and we’re all bad,” Gutierrez said. “People aren’t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they’ll come out to stop Trump.” Clinton’s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. “She’s OK, I guess,” said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. “My main worry is Trump’s fingers on the nuclear code. But I’d say she knows what she’s doing.” In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they’re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she’s a typical lying politician, so they’re voting for Trump—and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they’re staying home. “She’s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,” he said. “She’s great on the issues, but it’s hard to get people to focus on that.” Clinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband’s administration and recovery during Obama’s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. “When Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,” said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. “Man, Hillary should talk about that.” But Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn’t focused on his policies, because they’re so insubstantial and flexible, because he’s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It’s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump’s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump. So Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They’ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it. *** Tonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump’s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump’s political brand is all about breaking the rules. What is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president’s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can’t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight’s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won’t be normal, but it won’t be the first time, either. And yes, even though she’s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo—not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She’s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn’t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn’t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they’ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event. But the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren’t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they’re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values—showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren’t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences—that have constrained politicians in a good way. It’s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they’re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.",1,0,0
1366,"As far as terrorism is concerned, yesterday was a good and a bad day for Americans. In addition to a knife wielding Allah chanting attacker in a Minnesota mall, who injured 7 before being shot dead by an off duty police officer, there was an undetonated bomb found in Seaside Park in NJ and 2 bombs found in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, one undetonated and one detonated, which injured 29 people. At this juncture, police are saying that all three devices appear to have been made by the same person. It was a good day in that no intended victims died. And it was a bad day in that these incidents expose how vulnerable Americans are to these kinds of attacks, especially in urban areas with large numbers of people in them. Terrorists in America look like regular people. They are not wearing all black outfits and masks, or marching in groups down the middle of the street. They look like shoppers, coworkers and fellow subway riders. It is difficult to identify terrorists and that makes it difficult to discover their plans and stop therm. What we need to remember is this; these are not random attacks. They are, most times, planned out and carried out by radical Islamic terrorists who absolutely hate western civilization. When or if we see something odd or suspicious, we must say something. If a guy is standing in line at Walmart buying 4 pressure cookers, that’s something odd. We cannot assume that everyone around has our best interests in mind. If you see something, say something.  We need a President who will get serious about vetting immigrants, stemming the tide of refugees and illegal immigrants and keeping Americans safe. We know which person will do that if elected and it isn’t Hillary. If Hillary wins, she will bring more refugees in. She has said it. If Trump wins, he will put an end to our destructive immigration policy. And that is what he has said. The safety of Americans on our own soil must be paramount. It is time to get serious about which people we let in and which ones we don’t. There are 7 knife victims and 29 bombing victims who deserved better. They deserve a government that puts them first. While the knife attacker in the mall was thankfully taken out by an armed officer, New York City Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said “I am concerned, we have a bomb that detonated and no one apprehended.” That’s right, the bomber is still out there. If you see something say something…before you can’t.   ",0,0,1

330,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this."" RELATED: Charlotte police shoot and kill man, sparking growing protest ""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards."" Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer. Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. ""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said. Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America. ""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

76,"Eastern Aleppo saw what witnesses describe as an unprecedented and relentless offensive as United Nations diplomats demanded a halt to the violence Sunday. This morning airstrikes continued to hit the rebel-held part of Aleppo, say locals. “Six have died at the hospital so far since airstrikes started to hit this morning,” Abu Rajab, a radiologist and managing director of an Aleppo hospital, told ABC News. Sunday's airstrikes were heavier than anything he had seen or heard since the Syrian war started over five years ago, he said. “It felt as if the ground was shaking under you, like an earthquake,” he said of the strikes. “The explosions sounded loud and strange, like nothing we’ve heard before in five years of war. It was a bloody day. No words can describe what happened yesterday.”   He said the hospital received about 180 injured people from Sunday's attacks and had to refer some of them to other clinics because it didn’t have the capacity to treat all of them. About 40 percent of the wounded were children, and 20 percent were women, he said. The intensive care unit was so filled up with patients that one surgeon had to conduct an operation on a floor. Since midnight Saturday, at least 27 people were killed by strikes from warplanes and government helicopters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday. At least 70 people have been killed in airstrikes on eastern Aleppo from Friday to Sunday night, activists in Syria told ABC News. The United Nations said the recent attacks on Aleppo could amount to war crimes.    “Repeated airstrikes and the use of bunker-busting and incendiary bombs in densely populated areas could well prove to be war crimes,” David Swanson, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told ABC News. The U.N. has 40 trucks with aid ready to enter eastern Aleppo. The aid has been sitting by the Turkey-Syria border for about two weeks and is still waiting at a Syrian customs area. Once the U.N. gets the green light, the first convoy carrying a month's worth of wheat flour for more than 150,000 people will be sent to Aleppo, according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The shipment will be followed up by a delivery of enough food rations to feed 35,000 people for a month. The distance from the border to eastern Aleppo is only some 40 miles, but the journey could take about four to five hours. While up to 275,000 people in eastern Aleppo are still waiting for the aid they need, humanitarian assistance entered the four besieged Syrian towns of Madaya, Foah, Zabadani and Kefraya on Sunday.    On Wednesday evening, one of two water pumping stations in eastern Aleppo was destroyed by airstrikes. In retaliation, rebels turned off the second water pumping station, which mainly serves the government-held western part of the city. That means that close to 2 million people in Aleppo are living without running water. At an emergency meeting Sunday, Western U.N. diplomats condemned the recent escalating violence in Aleppo and blamed Russia and the Syrian government. Samantha Powers, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., accused Russia of committing barbarism under the guise of counterterrorism. “Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and [Syrian President Bashar al-]Assad make war. Instead of helping get lifesaving aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing humanitarian convoys, hospitals and first responders who are trying desperately to keep people alive,” Powers told members of the Security Council Sunday. “It seems the only items that make it into eastern Aleppo these days are barrel bombs and incendiaries that witnesses report seen dropped by Assad's forces and Russian forces. Russia, of course, has long had the power to stop this suffering. Even now, we will continue to look for any way possible to restore the cessation of hostilities.” Powers walked out of the emergency session along with the French and U.K. ambassadors to the U.N. in protest when Syria’s ambassador was called to speak. The U.S., the U.K. and France requested the emergency meeting after the Syrian military on Thursday announced a new offensive on eastern Aleppo.",1,0,0
768,"Legendary athlete Michael Jordan made a statement about the racial violence and tension with there law enforcement community.   Jordan said, “As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement. And angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.” He went on, “I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers—who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all—are respected and supported.” Jordan went on to talk about and praise law enforcement and how they have helped and protected him and his family in the past. But, he also acknowledged the fact that many African Americans do not feel the same way and have had a tremendously different experience with police that is not necessarily positive. The most touching part of his statements was when he called for change and for everybody to work together to attain that outcome. The star finished by saying, “To support that efforts, I am making contributions of $1 million each to two organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Although I know these contributions alone are not enough to solve the problem, I hope the resources will help both organizations make a positive difference.” People on Twitter and social media were quick to call him an Uncle Tom saying that his money was not needed and won’t make a difference. What he did though is highly profound. Not only did he acknowledge that yes, there is a problem in which African Americans are disproportionately discriminated against by police, he also acknowledged that most police officers are good people and deserve to be safe, healthy, and respected. He is able to come at it from both angles. And he put his money where his mouth is by donating a significant portion of money. A man of talk and action. Which is what is missing. Everyone talks but no one takes action. He did just that. Unlike another person who shall remain unnamed.. cough cough (Colin Kaepernick). He is able to see both sides and as an African American man who says that he will likley have a far greater impact than if a white man said it. It’s the voices of our friends we listen  to most. Whether we want to admit it or not, black people don’t want to hear white people preaching about racism. But when a black man says something they are more apt to listen. ",0,0,1

641,"“I’ve never seen anything like this. He’s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising.” — A Senior GOP operative about Donald Trump Across the Internet many political observers are wondering if Donald Trump has become the Republican version of Barack Obama. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump stood up to decry the obvious acts of terrorism in New Jersey and New York. For his efforts he was attacked, criticized, and derided by liberals and their partners in the media. As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D-NY) refused to call the terrorism what it was, Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for his “rhetoric.” Arguing that by talking tough, Mr. Trump was somehow giving “aid and comfort to the enemy.” “I don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,” Clinton said. “We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“ Clinton says Trump's rhetoric has ""given aid and comfort"" to terrorists. Phrase is definition of treason. — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 19, 2016  In fact, the left, almost as one, decried Trump’s comments as problematic and insinuated that he was encouraging Muslim terrorism by condemning the attacks. However, most Americans seem to have agreed with Mr. Trump, and by Monday most liberals in and out of the media had also come to realize that Trump’s early comments were correct. We don’t yet know how the weekend’s events will play into the upcoming election, but we can look at a few other indicators that give Trump and his supporters reason to be optimistic. Fundraising for example. Donald Trump has already, with 7 weeks left before Election Day, outraised both John McCain and Mitt Romney among “small donors.” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has raised as much as $100 million from small-dollar donors contributing $200 or less to his campaign — in less than three months. Trump’s campaign has surpassed a “threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign,” according to Politico, which looked over Federal Election Commission filings and spoke with operatives familiar with the campaign’s fundraising efforts.

146,"As we know, the final United Nations General Assembly of President Obama’s presidency is occurring in New York City this week. That gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year’s very strange presidential election. Many seem rather rattled about the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, while others merely poked fun at Trump’s buffoonery. One diplomat mocked Trump, saying, “he’s a clown.” Another said, “He’s nuts.” Yet another said that Trump is an “untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator.” Well, it’s too bad so many American citizens can’t see these traits in Trump. An Ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in America has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the Trump Train. That in and of itself is very telling. Dennis Jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs, says that Trump’s behavior has “made many diplomats nervous and worried about American leadership, America’s role in the world.” Also curious is the fact that the American people have succumbed to the belief that Hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the Ipsos poll say that they find Hillary to be “somewhat” or “very much” in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. On the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust Trump “a little” while the rest said they don’t trust him as far as they can throw him. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says that Trump is a “hate preacher” and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. French President François Hollande says that the GOP nominee’s “excesses make you want to retch.” One lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of Trump making it to the White House. Speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: “Foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. This is less about Democrat versus Republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis-à-vis the rest of the world. With a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the West, there is a real concern it will take hold in the United States and in what form it might show itself post-election. Whether it’s immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the U.S. is teetering on closing.” Even more alarming, the diplomats say, is Trump’s “America First” and isolationist demagoguery. Stephen Walt, who works as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, says of the situation among diplomats: “First and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-November situation, and I think they regard Trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark. Whatever Hillary Clinton’s strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, people don’t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she’s elected.” Of course, another source of more than a little concern is Trump’s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the United States, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of World War II. In other words, the entire world is afraid of Donald Trump. Why aren’t the American people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? Donald Trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency. ",0,1,0
349,"Orlando, Florida (CNN)Hillary Clinton's aides wanted their candidate to start talking more about policy and less about Trump. On Wednesday, Clinton did just that. The Democratic presidential nominee forcefully argued in favor of giving people with disabilities an equal chance at success during an event here, saying defending the disabled would be ""a vital aspect of my presidency."" The speech offered implicit contrast with Trump -- who last year memorably mocked New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in his arms. But Clinton entirely ignored the Republican nominee during the event, never using his name in the roughly 30-minute speech. Wednesday's speech was Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton's past ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families have been far more focused on Trump. Wednesday's address, instead, lived up to what Clinton's aides had hoped the series of speeches would be: More policy than politics. Clinton said people with disabilities are ""invisible, overlooked and undervalued"" and that the United States is ""falling short"" in protecting their rights. ""We've got to face that and do better -- for everyone's sake,"" Clinton said. ""Because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans."" Clinton added that as president, she would do away with the subminimum wage, urge Congress to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and launch a program to help with autism in the workplace. ""People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past,"" Clinton said of laws that allow employers to pay people with disabilities less than the minimum wage. Some advocates for the disabled, however, have feared that the elimination of the subminimum wage would diminish hiring of disabled workers. Jennifer Mizrahi, the president of Respect Ability, an advocacy organization for people with disabilities, said the speech was the first time a presidential candidate has dedicated an entire campaign event to the disabled. People with disabilities are usually the ""poorest of the poor,"" Mizrahi said, noting that around 400,000 disabled people work in ""sheltered work shops where they can pay subminimum wages, as little as 20 cents an hour."" The activist also suggested the Clinton's struggles would be helped by focusing on people with disabilities. ""We span every demographic,"" she said. ""A lot of white people with disabilities."" Clinton is beating Trump with Latino and African-American voters, but lagging behind the Republicans with white voters, especially those without a college degree.

1540,"Yet another black female sailor declared that she would sit during the National Anthem. Janaye Ervin posted on Facebook her intentions and declared the Navy was punishing her for exercising her constitutional rights. The military is a realm unto its own. It is governed by military law and procedure. This woman has served in the Navy for eight years… she damn well knows that and is using a Marxist/terrorist tactic… she’s using our own freedoms against us. Ervin is in violation of Navy regulations. They require all uniformed personnel to stand at attention and face the ensign while the anthem is played. You do not get an exception because you are black. As John Bloomer pointed out, anyone has a right to protest, but action conducted as a protest does not grant immunity from the law or a pass on any social consequence. The discipline within the naval ranks is warranted on her actions or lack thereof.  From the Independent Review Journal: The national anthem protests — inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick — were just gathering steam when the first American military member raised eyebrows by joining in. Facebook community, US Army Military Police WTF Moments, posted video of the sailor, who said that she would not stand for the anthem “until the U.S. proves that they’ve got my back as a black woman”:   Although the Navy did speak to the sailor in the video, officials made it clear that she would not be separated from the service for her actions. Last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well:  Ervin also said that she intended to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to spread freedom and democracy around the world.” But she would do well to heed the observation of fellow African American Martin Baker who was reminded of something he was told in training: “I was told in basic training the simplest of phrases: we are here to preserve and defend democracy, not practice it. When you put the uniform on, you must put aside your personal feelings and remember at that moment you are a direct representative of the United States of America. You are, if need be, the advanced diplomacy of the American way of life. If at any time you feel you cannot stand and represent our flag and our nation even in something as simple as the anthem, you forfeit the right to wear that uniform.” That is exactly right and it goes right to the heart of her transgression. Ervin’s actions could also be considered ‘political speech’, which is also against military regulations. Because of these two incidents, the Navy has issued new guidelines: According to Navy Regulation 1205, personnel in uniform must stand at attention and face the flag when the national anthem is played. Navy active-duty personnel in civilian clothes will face the flag, stand at attention, and place their right hand over their heart. Additionally, Sailors will receive training on the appropriate usage of social media, and must not use it to discredit the Naval Service, and should be reminded it could potentially be used as evidence against them. While military personnel are not excluded from the protections granted by the First Amendment, the US Supreme Court has stated that the different character of our community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections.” Neither of the sailors has been discharged… yet. But the new guidelines state that such actions will be punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ and will be considered serious offenses — grounds for involuntary separation from the service. As they should. Don’t enlist if you can’t follow the military’s rules, regulations and laws.

1601,"PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials. The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be. The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say. [A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned] Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change. In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines. Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers. Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban. “We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.” Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates. The ban was then postponed until 2020.",0,1,0
1324,"Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner who Donald Trump once called “Miss Piggy,” was “the worst we ever had,” the Manhattan billionaire said Tuesday morning, because “she gained a massive amount of weight.” Hillary Clinton called attention to Machado’s case towards the end of Monday night’s presidential debate, recalling that Trump had not only called her “Miss Piggy” but also “Miss Housekeeping,” a reference to her Hispanic heritage. Addressing Trump’s name-calling directly, Clinton said “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a U.S. citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" Story Continued Below Trump said that while nothing Clinton did throughout the debate to that point had managed to get under his skin, the former secretary of state’s decision to bring up Machado did frustrate him. “That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” Trump explained during a Tuesday morning appearance on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.” Clinton’s discussion of the former Miss Universe winner came amid a larger attack against Trump’s history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women. Of her GOP opponent, Clinton said “This is a man who has calling women pigs, slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said that women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.” Trump said he had considered replying by raising former President Bill Clinton’s history of infidelity as a response but opted against it because the couple’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was in the room. The Manhattan billionaire said he might opt not to hold back such an attack at the next debate. “Well, I may hit her harder certain ways,” he said. “I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. So, I may hit her harder in certain ways.”",1,0,0
1063,"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has no qualms about the strength of Donald Trump as president of the United States. Sitting down with CNN’s Erin Burnett in an interview set to air Wednesday night, Sisi had two words when asked whether he thought Trump would make a strong leader: “No doubt.” Story Continued Below Asked whether he and Trump discussed the Republican nominee’s past proposals and remarks about Muslim immigration, Sisi made note of the U.S.’ existing “very strict security measures for everyone who wishes to visit it which has been in place for quite a few years.” “It’s also important to know that during election campaigns many statements are made and many things are said, however afterwards governing the country would be something different,” Sisi told Burnett. “And will be subject to many factors.” Burnett pressed, asking whether Sisi meant to say that Trump “is saying what he needs to say to be elected but that he might not follow through with the plan.” “I don’t want to be unfair to anyone here. During election campaigns there is a perception based on a certain vision and a point of view,” Sisi remarked. “Then that vision or point of view gets corrected and develops as a result of experience, reports and advice from experts."" As far as his separate meeting with Hillary Clinton, Sisi suggested the Democratic nominee would make a good president as well. “Political parties in the United States would not allow candidates to reach that level unless they are qualified to lead a country the size of the United States of America,” Sisi replied. Asked about Clinton’s comments in a past debate in which she referred the “army dictatorship” under Sisi, the Egyptian leader hedged his response. “I will answer this question in two ways. I believe that that statement was not made after our most recent meeting between myself and Mrs. Clinton,” Sisi said. “But also in Egypt there will not be a chance for any dictatorship because in Egypt there is a constitution, there is law, and there the will of the people which will refuse to allow any leader to stay in his position for any period longer than his term which is four years.""",1,0,0
1374,"Hollywood loses yet another one of their dearest actresses, and we are heartbroken. She was born in Chicago Illinois on December 27, 1942 and loved by anyone and everyone who came in contact with her. Many of you probably remember the legendary actress as Liesl Von Trapp from “The Sound of Music.” Charmian Carr definitely left an imprint on Hollywood, and she will never be forgotten. TMZ reported the death of the 73-year-old on Sunday September 18, 2016. Carr’s rep stated that she died from complications from dementia. Apparently she was battling a rare form of the disease.  Carr’s story was a very unique one, which makes her acting journey so special. At the time that she auditioned for “The Sound of Music” she was a student at the San Fernando Valley State College. She was studying speech therapy and philosophy, and was also working for a doctor. “I was going to college and getting extra spending money by modeling in fashion shows in one of the stores. One of the girls who modeled with me knew that Robert Wise, producer-director of The Sound of Music had been conducting a four-month search for someone to play the part of 16-year-old Liesl. My friend, without my knowing it, sent in my picture and explained in a note that I sang and danced. I received a call from Mr. Wise to come for a tryout. It took me completely by surprise…”  After completing “The Sound of Music” and several other acting parts, Carr left her career in acting and pursued another life-long dream of hers. Charmian started her own interior design business “Charmian Carr Designs” and surprisingly it took off a lot easier than she expected – especially after being hired by Michael Jackson. Carr married Jay Brent who was a dentist in 1967 and 24 years later the couple got a divorce. They had two beautiful daughters together. She is survived by all of her siblings, her daughters and her grandchildren.  She brought joy to everyone around her and even still today she is known and loved by those who watch her shows. Her smile lit up every room she walked into and her positive personality was contagious. Please continue to keep this family in your prayers as they mourn the loss of their loved one. I can’t help but watch this over and over and think that there will never be anyone who could replace this woman!  RIP CHARMIAN CARR.",0,0,1

1071,"Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested that Oklahoma police officer Betty Shelby may have choked when she shot dead Terence Crutcher on the side of a highway last week in Tulsa. Speaking at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee said, ""This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very, very troubled by that. I'm very, very troubled by that. And we have to be very — we have to be very careful."" Story Continued Below He added, ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? They can't be doing what they're doing."" On Crutcher, he said, ""I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man."" Trump called, via Twitter, for an ""immediate end"" to the unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, that broke out after a police shooting of a black man on Tuesday, the latest in a string of such fatal shootings that also included last week's shooting of Crutcher. ""Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, also writing, ""The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again."" Violent protests have rocked Charlotte in the past 24 hours, as demonstrators demand answers as to why Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday night in a parking lot of an apartment complex. Police said Scott was holding a gun, while his family said he was sitting in his car reading a book. That shooting follows the fatal incident in Tulsa, in which Crutcher was shot dead by Shelby on the side of a highway, after she claimed he was behaving strangely and feared he was reaching for a weapon. Trump, who has positioned himself as the ""law and order candidate,"" has been criticized in the past for what some see as opportunistic reactions to tragic events. Last month, he sparked outrage when he tweeted in response to a Chicago shooting which killed Nykea Aldridge, Dwyane Wade's cousin. He was accused of being insensitive, and using the incident to further his political agenda, tweeting, ""Dwayne [sic] Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!"" The Republican presidential nominee has, in recent weeks, been trying to appeal to black voters. Many denounced his comments Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, when he said that black communities in the United States are ""in the worst shape ever."" He raised similar controversy last month in another appeal to black voters when he said ""what the hell do you have to lose?"" by trying something new like Trump. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who on Tuesday called Crutcher's shooting ""intolerable,"" also weighed in on Wednesday morning, tweeting, ""Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher.

1046,"You can choose one or more of the explanations for what has happened to Hillary Clinton in recent weeks as Donald Trump has closed in on her in the polls. The “fundamentals” of this year—economic and political data—have pointed to a close race for more than a year; Trump has (until his recent birther nonsense) offered a more temperate version of himself; Clinton has been haunted by her emails and her health; Republican holdouts have been returning to the fold, another sign that the electorate will vote more and more along lines of party preference. But what is especially bedeviling the Clinton campaign is that, at least until now, constituencies most critical to her campaign seem to have no sense of urgency about keeping the Donald Trump out of the White House. While Hispanics, who backed Obama in 2012 by a more than 2-1 margin, support Clinton by a similar margin, they seem far less inclined to vote than they did four years ago. Story Continued Below That is what could change now that Trump threatens to actually take the White House. Younger voters, who not only backed Obama by landslide margins but turned out in record percentages in 2012, have until now expressed relative indifference to the campaign or have turned to the alternatives: Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. If last week’s Quinnipiac poll is right, the race among 18-to-34-year-olds looks like a four-way split: She wins only 31 percent to Trump’s 26 percent. In fact, Johnson runs second, with 29 percent; Stein, running in low single digits nationally, pulls in 15 percent of 18-to-34 year olds. And remember: without massive support and a heavy turnout among younger voters, Obama’s margins in Florida and other key states would have been wiped out. Yes, support for minor party candidates tend to fall when the leaves do; yes, the Clinton campaign has a get-out-the-vote machine whose reputation—yet untested—is formidable. But what may be their most powerful weapon is the clear possibility that Trump could win, which is why Clinton’s very bad few weeks could, in the end, be very good for her. Trump’s climbing numbers could finally motivate her complacent Democratic base and other voters who have never been crazy about her and not especially motivated to come out to the polls, especially if she were running away with the race. Here is where Hillary Clinton might think about channeling the arguments of two historical figures you might not normally think of in the same paragraph: Oliver Cromwell and John McEnroe. Back in 1650, the first (and last) non-royal ruler of Britain tried to dissuade the Scots from declaring Charles II as king. Saying, in a famous appeal: “I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, consider it possible that you may be mistaken.” Three hundred and eighty one years later, in the midst of another British field of battle—Wimbledon—John McEnroe saw one of his serves ruled a fault and screamed incredulously: “You cannot be serious!” Somewhere between Cromwell and McEnroe lies the Clinton campaign’s most plausible argument to its wavering voters: Get real, folks. “You’re looking at Johnson and Stein as a way of rejecting a corrupt, unresponsive two-party system,” England’s Lord Protector might say to millennials, sounding a lot like Bernie Sanders, “because there’s no difference between the two parties. But please be willing to consider that you might be mistaken. Look back 16 years, and see what a similar vote—for Ralph Nader—did. His 94,000 voters in Florida would have wound up giving Gore a net of about 20,000 votes—more than enough to make butterfly ballots and hanging chads irrelevant. Now, between launching the Iraq War and the two Supreme Court justices Bush appointed, did it really make no difference?” McEnroe—looking and sounding remarkably like Elizabeth Warren, who’s now out there stumping for Hillary—might then chime in: “You cannot be serious if you think you have the luxury of a ‘protest’ vote for Johnson or Stein. If you vote as a Libertarian for Johnson, you will materially increase the chances of a Trump presidency. Look at the list of potential judges. On everything from gay rights to abortion to his own views of the First Amendment, Trump is on record as rejecting core libertarian principles. If you vote for Jill Stein as a progressive, you are helping to put in power a president whose tax plan makes the rich richer, who thinks climate chance is a hoax, who wants to abolish whole swaths of environmental protection laws. So voting for Johnson or Stein means you’re voting for a label—a ’libertarian,’ or a ‘progressive’—without realizing that the consequence of that vote could lead to a president who rejects everything you claim to hold dear.” There’s no guarantee that any of these arguments will work. They come, after all, at the end of a 15-month-long Trump campaign that was guaranteed to collapse at countless moments (I’d list them, but anyone following this campaign has likely committed them to memory). And it still requires, as its ultimate point, an insistence that these voters summon themselves to vote for a candidate for whom they have little or no enthusiasm. Obama’s supporters turned out in significant numbers because they were hungry and saw in his presidency a feast; the voters Clinton must summon are being told “eat your peas because you have to.” That’s an emotional detachment that a dozen speeches heavy on policy, like the one she delivered Monday, won’t repair. Of course, it’s possible that Trump’s own character and temperament, revealed on the debate stage or in his bizarre-world campaign appearances, will convince voters that in the end , he is a risk they are not prepared to take. But for voters unsure about Clinton, relying on Trump to self-destruct after what he has survived is a risk they cannot take. So, even though the Scottish Presbyterians rejected Cromwell’s plea, and even though the officials at Wimbledon did not change their call, their pleas still suggest that Trump’s rise in the polls could be a powerful argument for Clinton.",1,0,0

The April 24, 2016 death of 38-year-old Terrill Thomas has been officially ruled as a homicide, with the cause of Thomas’ death being attributed to “profound dehydration,” after an autopsy by the Milwaukee County medical examiner. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, inmates heard Thomas plead with jail guards for water while being held in connection with a shooting. Marcus Berry, who occupied the cell across from Thomas for the last six days of his life, said guards were purposefully denying him water due to Thomas’ erratic behavior in his previous cell. However, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment on whether or not inmates were denied water due to disciplinary reasons. “I could tell he was getting weaker,” Berry said. “One day he just lay down, dehydrated and hungry.” When Berry asked if Thomas needed water, he said it sounded like Thomas tried to say “yeah” but couldn’t fully speak. Berry said he urged a correctional officer to bring Thomas water, but said he was told it would have to wait until another officer was on duty. “You can’t punish someone by depriving them of the nourishment they need to survive,” said Erik Heipt, an attorney specializing in wrongful death lawsuits for inmates, in an interview with the .

49,"Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs. ""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today. On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound. The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity. ""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others."" He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training. ""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""     But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed. Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime. During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,"" Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty. Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence. ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago. In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community.

Clinton reacted this morning aboard her campaign plane, saying, ""Anyone who complains about the microphone is not having a good night."" Asked by reporters whether she thinks Trump will skip the remaining two debates next month — as he and some of his surrogates have suggested — she said she'll be there, no matter what. ""Well, I'm going to show up. He gets to decide what he's going to do,"" Clinton said. ""But I will be there in St. Louis and then after that in Las Vegas. She added, ""If I'm the only person onstage, well, you know, I'm the only person onstage."" At her campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina, today Clinton took a veiled swipe at Trump's wealth. ""One of my guests was Mark Cuban,"" Clinton said, referring to him as ""a real billionaire.""",1,0,0
735,"Donald Trump has economic advisers that have helped him develop a plan that will grow the economy. It is in great contrast to the socialist economy the Hillary has planned for you. It addresses the current regulatory burden, energy, and trade in a manner that will meet your approval. Read some of the specifics for yourself.    As Written By Newsmax: Donald Trump’s economic plan will “significantly increase America’s real GDP growth rate” – resulting in trillions of dollars of additional revenues, according to a new study authored by investor Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, a top economist at the University of California. “When evaluated as a single integrated whole, the Trump plan is revenue neutral and fiscally conservative,” Ross and Navarro write in the study. Ross, one of the nation’s most respected private equity investors, and Navarro serve as senior economic policy advisers for Trump’s campaign. “It grows the economy much faster than Hillary Clinton’s plan to raise taxes, increase regulation, stifle our energy sector, and perpetuate chronic trade deficits,” the study finds. Meanwhile, Trump’s economic plan “proposes tax cuts, reduced regulation, lower energy costs, and eliminating America’s chronic trade deficit,” Ross-Navarro say. The authors conclude that “Hillary Clinton’s economic plan will inhibit growth.” Hillary Clinton “proposes higher taxes, more regulation, and further restrictions on fossil fuels that will significantly raise energy and electricity costs,” the report states. “Clinton will also perpetuate trade policies and trade deals she has helped put in place that have led to chronic trade deficits and reduced economic growth.” The economists write that Trump’s reforms in trade, regulations and energy would result in revenue gains of $2.374 trillion, making the ….

1187,"Top Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills received an immunity deal from the Justice Department in the FBI’s investigation into the former secretary of state’s private email server, records shown to Congress revealed Friday, re-injecting the email controversy into the presidential campaign just days before her first debate with Donald Trump. In addition to Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff at State, grants of partial immunity were also extended to former Clinton aide Heather Samuelson, who worked as State's White House liaison and later as a private attorney for Clinton and to John Bentel, who was director of the the Information Resources Management section in the secretary of state's office, lawmakers said. Story Continued Below The newly disclosed information brings to five the number of individuals known to have received some form of immunity in connection with the FBI probe, which ended with the bureau recommending that no charges be brought against Clinton or her aides for mishandling classified information. ""This is beyond explanation. The FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy,” House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Friday in a statement. “I've lost confidence in this investigation and I question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. Immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the FBI."" The immunity grants to Mills and Samuelson were narrow, covering only their handover of laptops used in 2014, after Clinton left State, to conduct a review of the former secretary's emails to separate work-related messages from those purely personal in nature. The immunity came after the women were interviewed by the FBI and did not cover any of their statements. People familiar with the immunity offer said it was not related to the lawyers' testimony, noting that FBI Director James Comey said in July there was no evidence of a deletion aimed at frustrating the investigation. A lawyer for Mills and Samuelson, Beth Wilkinson, said she requested the immunity grants because of inter-agency disputes about whether some information in Clinton's emails was classified. ""As the government indicated in these letters, the DOJ and FBI considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more. Indeed, the Justice Department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. At all points my clients cooperated with the government’s investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the FBI and DOJ,"" Wilkinson said in a statement. ""The letters released to the Hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work,"" Wilkinsion added. ""Because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies’ positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, I advised my clients to accept this letter from DOJ."" Bentel, however, received immunity before speaking with the FBI, people familiar with the situation said. Former State employees told agency investigators Bentel brushed back their concerns about Clinton's email setup. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee stressed in a statement emailed to reporters that the immunity offers to Mills and Samuelson were ""very limited."" ""These very limited immunity agreements did not extend to any testimony before Congress, statements to the FBI, or assertions to any other investigators,"" they said. The Clinton campaign attributed the information's release to the proximity of Monday's presidential debate. ""House Republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a Justice Department investigation that was closed months ago without any charges whatsoever, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement, noting that Mills and Samuelson cooperated fully with the FBI's inquiry and ""had already given full interviews to the investigators."" A top aide to Donald Trump's presidential campaign said word of the additional immunity grants underscored the recklessness of Clinton's conduct. ""Revelations that three additional individuals, including Cheryl Mills, were granted immunity from prosecution in Hillary Clinton’s email scandal shows this was without a doubt a criminal scheme,"" Trump aide Jason Miller said in a statement. ""At its heart, Clinton’s secret server was an end run around government transparency laws designed to hide corruption between the Clinton Foundation and her State Department, an arrangement which ultimately put our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts at risk. No one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as president of the United States or hold any public office."" Miller also suggested that the immunity grants were aimed at preventing Clinton from facing justice in the case. ""What has become abundantly clear is that the Obama administration is protecting Hillary Clinton from accountability at all costs because she will keep the rigged system in Washington in place. In light of this development, Hillary Clinton must immediately come forward and promise the American people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration,"" the Trump aide added. For weeks, House Republicans have been seeking the FBI's full file in the probe and, last week, issued a subpoena demanding the records. Republicans disclosed the immunity agreements just after learning about them in investigative records shown to congressional staff by the Justice Department on Friday. Immunity offers to witnesses are not made by the FBI, but by the Justice Department. A department spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FBI had no immediate comment. It was previously disclosed that prosecutors granted immunity to former State Department computer specialist Bryan Pagliano and to a computer technician Clinton hired through a private firm, Paul Combetta of Denver-based Platte River Networks. The immunity deals for the two appear to be broader than those given to Mills and Samuelson, although no one in the probe is known to have received full immunity.

Cadets vote at a polling station. Vladimir Putin's United Russia party won a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party | Vasily Batanov/AFP via Getty Images By Oliver Carroll 9/19/16, 3:14 PM CET Updated 9/20/16, 6:08 AM CET MOSCOW — Two years of economic recession, Western sanctions and wars in Ukraine and Syria haven’t shaken Vladimir Putin’s grip on power. Instead, Sunday’s election to the Russian state Duma saw the president’s United Russia party win a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party. There was never any doubt about the outcome, and many Russians didn’t bother to turn out. Nationwide, only 48 percent voted compared to 60 percent in the previous elections for the lower house of parliament. The numbers were even worse in Moscow and St. Petersburg, bastions of the educated middle classes and traditionally more protest-oriented. This time, despite some reports of voter fraud, there were no signs of demonstrations. “They did everything [so] that people would ignore the elections, from holding them just after the summer break, to the most low-key election campaign I can remember,” said political expert Grigorii Golosov. On Monday, with 93 percent of the votes counted, United Russia had 54.2 percent of the vote, up from 49.3 percent five years ago. Russia’s new electoral system, a mix of party lists and single mandate districts, means that Putin’s party wins a huge constitutional majority of 343 seats in the 450-seat Duma — compared to 238 seats in 2011. With its super majority, United Russia will have free rein over parliament, dropping the need to bargain with friendly opposition parties. It can also change the constitution at will. In southern Russia a CCTV camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. On the latest figures, the Communist Party will likely finish second, slightly ahead of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, with the center-left Just Russia fourth. They were all in the previous parliament, and traditionally support the government on many issues and refrain from attacking Putin. While there is some pressure for the Communists to be more independent— their leader Gennady Zyuganov at one point refused to recognize the results — all three can be expected to remain loyal. All in all, it was a terrible election for Russia’s liberal fringe, which now faces the prospect of obliteration. They’re down from one seat in the previous Duma to none. Their best hope, the liberal opposition Yabloko party, scored less than 2 percent of the vote, and will now lose out on government funding. The liberal-democratic PARNAS party failed to get 1 percent, and most of the candidates supported by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky were wiped out. Also On Politico Oliver Carroll Also On Politico Kristen East Also On Politico Vince Chadwick The centrist opposition also failed to break through in any of the single-mandate districts. The closest candidate, Yabloko’s Dmitry Gudkov, lost in the Moscow suburbs. As he faced defeat, Gudkov told POLITICO he had battled the full might of the government machine, but said that the result was ultimately down to the passivity of Russian democrats. “Voters didn’t turn up,” he said. “Russia’s middle class now is about to get what it deserves.” Only one independent and two right-wing populist candidates made it into the Duma, but they won’t give much support to the liberal opposition. One of the nationalist winners of the single-mandate run-offs was Vitaly Milonov, a former deputy of the St. Petersburg city government who has campaigned on an anti-gay rights platform. Although the outcome was never in doubt, the Kremlin made sure that the voting procedure was cleaned up from 2011, when voter fraud sparked anti-Putin protests. However, there were still questionable incidents, the most obvious being in Rostov in southern Russia where a CCTV camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. In other places, voters were lured to the polls with free sausages and other goodies. Denis Korotkov, a correspondent for the St. Petersburg news portal Fontanka, managed to vote several times. He immediately wrote about the incident and brought it to the attention of the authorities. Law enforcement subsequently detained Korotkov — who is now threatened with prosecution for electoral violations. While the opposition faces being wiped out, the upshot for Putin is that his control of Russia is stronger than ever. He is likely to decide to run for a fourth term as president in 2018. As part of the preparations for yet another run, Putin recently reshuffled his closest advisers, weeding out those who might dare to challenge him and replacing them with lesser-known men completely dependent on his favor. The election also means there is likely to be little change in Russia’s policies on Ukraine and Syria, or in its economic program. “In practical terms, little will change with the new parliament,” wrote Capital Economics, an analysis firm, in a post-election note. “United Russia already held a majority in parliament, and didn’t face effective opposition. The strong showing for United Russia (and disappointing results for the opposition) suggests that the direction of policy will be largely unchanged.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

573,"On January 20, 1961, newly elected and duly sworn into office President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, ended his memorable and stirring inaugural address with the words “asking for God’s help, here on Earth, God’s work, must truly be our own.” Despite his obvious moral failings in his private life, President Kennedy’s personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people. That said, we also know he was a Democrat, and the last Democrat to serve as President, whose efforts as Chief Executive were meant to build up America, rather than to tear America apart. Following the tragic assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, up to and including the present, there have been four more Presidents from the Democratic Party: Lyndon Johnson, (1963-69); Jimmie Carter (1977-81); Bill Clinton (1993-2001); and Barack Obama, (2009-?). Under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership, the United States of America and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled, fragmented, weakened, and mercilessly abused. During these past 50 years, thanks to the national Democrats and the left-wing allies in Congress, the White House and our Federal Court System, the national Democratic Party has become America’s largest and most powerful “hate group.” Lyndon Johnson, also known as “LBJ” took America into the malicious morass of the Vietnam war, and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the “Great Society,” spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty, especially in our cities and our minority communities, in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency. At the same time, we fought an undeclared war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia for a decade, resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the U.S. Military, only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of North and South Vietnam into one Communist nation. LBJ partnered with another, degenerate member of the Kennedy clan, Ted Kennedy, to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the “open borders” mess that brings in terrorists, America-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival. James Earl “Jimmie” Carter, sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one January evening and told Americans that we were in a “malaise,” or more directly expressed, Americans were in a foul mood, anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation, as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering but dormant radical Islam, with the takeover of the American Embassy and the “triumphant” return from French exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran and leadership in 1979. Carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed Americans for a mood of “malaise” that Carter created. Jimmie Carter’s primary accomplishment in four years as President was the humiliation of America before the rest of the world, as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of Americans. William Jefferson “Bill” Clinton began his Presidency on January 20, 1993 with his “gratuitous” attendance at the “Gay and Lesbian Inaugural Ball” in Washington, beginning on day one of his Presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the LBGT Lobby. Soon after, Clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy permitting Gays to serve without fear of discharge. He put “Hillary the Horrible” Clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people, and Bill Clinton, with the successful enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or “NAFTA”, accelerated to “warp speed” the exodus of American businesses, jobs, and wealth to foreign nations such as Mexico, that had begun in the 1970s. Later in his Presidency his womanizing caught up with him and, after having one or more sexual affairs in the White House, was impeached by Congress, not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to Congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities. Three previous Democratic Presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening America, by the time the notorious Barack Hussein Obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th President on January 20, 2009. His eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history. Half our entire national debt ($10 Billion of the $20 Billion) was created in just the past eight years of Obama’s tenure. Yet Mr. Obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending. The economy is in shambles, the infrastructure of highways, bridges, and public lands is crumbling, while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled. Meanwhile tens of millions of Americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls, food stamps, forced early retirements, long term unemployment, and social security disability fraud. Mr. Obama, whose sworn duty along with Congress under the Constitution is to “promote the General Welfare, has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable, in response to their collective loud potty mouths, collective asinine demands, and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas. Mr. Obama has used the “bully pulpit” leadership tradition begun by Teddy Roosevelt, not to uplift, inspire and unify, but instead to berate, lecture and divide Americans. To Barack Obama, “(radical) black lives matter”; “gay and lesbian lives matter”; “radical Muslim lives matter”; “illegal alien lives matter”; convicted criminals lives matter”; meanwhile, the lives of ordinary, law-abiding, responsible working Americans, do not matter; the lives of Christians, foreign and domestic, do not matter; the lives of American military servicemen and women do not matter; the lives of our veterans do not matter; the lives of the “thin blue line” of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter; and, with all certainty, the protections due to Americans under our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, in the mind of Mr. Obama, do not matter at all. In the half century since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under the Presidency of the four Democratic Presidents that followed, as well as the years of Democratic control of Congress, and Federal Courts, the national Democratic Party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent, hardworking and law abiding majority in America, while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars, to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups, to the severe detriment of the much earned and deserving general welfare of the vast majority of our nation’s citizens. The national Democratic Party has become nothing short of America’s most powerful “hate group.” The American left wing, socialists and Democrats are the party that despises, attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within America. This “hate group” called the national Democratic Party demonizes: (1) law abiding morally upright American citizens; (2) unborn children; Christians; (3) Constitutional Conservatives; (4) legal gun owners; (5) job-producing energy businesses in oil, gas and coal production; (6) rural and small town America; (7) the ranching and farming West, including the “horse culture “ of wild mustangs and ranchers; (8) small business owners; (9) our police and our military, including veterans; and (10) above all, the Democratic party despises God, the Bible, Christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to Judeo-Christian foundations cited by the Founding Fathers 240 years ago. Although the Judeo-Christian, moral and ethical, Constitutional Conservative American majority is clearly despised by the “hate group” called the Democratic Party, we the American majority do not hate, because Jesus Christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another, and not to hate the sinner, but to instead only hate the sin. The vast majority of Americans should, and indeed do, hate sin. However, the Democratic Party clearly despises us. To paraphrase John F. Kennedy’s words from 1961; Americans who are Constitutional Conservatives, Christians and law abiding, ethical citizens must “help every friend, and oppose any foe.” We must love and support each other, but at the same time, we must band together and fight the Left Wing. We must fight the evil of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. We must fight the immorality of communism, fascism, radical LBGT groups, radical Islam, collectivist Socialism, radical Atheism, and every foe of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Ronald Reagan’s “Shining City on the Hill.” A famous aphorism states, “All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing.” Above all, therefore, righteous, conservative and patriotic Americans must fight evil, so that the good may once again prevail in America in the historically prevailing form of “Liberty, Justice and Virtue.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",0,0,1
1452,"Hillary Clinton has just postponed a high-dollar fundraiser, indefinitely! The event, called “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” invited donor levels between $2700 and $100,000 to attend. No reason was given for the change of event, originally scheduled to take place at the home of Michael Warner and Betty Craven. Clearly, Hillary Clinton’s serious health issues are why her campaign is imploding! This indefinite postponement couldn’t come at a worse possible time, as the campaign reportedly spent $50 million just last month trying to defeat Donald Trump. As WNCN reports: A small Eastern North Carolina town is preparing for Donald Trump’s appearance Tuesday just as a Hillary Clinton event in Chapel Hill on Tuesday was postponed. Trump will hold a rally in Kenansville Tuesday just two weeks after making a stop in Greenville. The rally will be held at the Duplin County Event Center and it is likely to be the largest event ever held in Kenansville, with a population of about 855. Duplin County Schools announced on Monday they would be closing at noon Tuesday in anticipation of Trump’s visit. High amounts of traffic are expected in the area, school officials said. Meanwhile, Clinton campaign officials said Monday afternoon that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed. The Clinton event was billed as “lunch with Hillary Rodham Clinton” and had four donation levels to attend. Those contribution levels were described as $100,000, which featured “chair reception with Hillary,” $33,000, which included a “host reception with Hillary,” $5,000, which included “preferred seating” and $2,700. While Hillary was unable to make an appearance, Trump is planning rallies in Kenansville, just weeks after a stop in Greenville.

Story Continued Below Kaine said Trump didn’t answer basic questions, such as about his tax returns, and he “showed that he was easily rattled.” He said Clinton’s best moment came when Trump was challenged on whether he said Clinton has the “look” to be president. During Monday’s debate at Hosftra University in New York, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about previous comments he made that the Democratic nominee doesn’t look presidential. Trump responded that Clinton doesn’t have the stamina, at which point Clinton shot back that as secretary of state she had traveled to hundreds of countries and testified for 11 hours on the Benghazi killings before a House committee, among other things. “She looked like she was ready for another 11 hours of debate, and he looked like he was running out of gas and leaning on the ropes,” Kaine said.",1,0,0
1491,"An officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies in the liberal media. Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them. But according to Tulsa World, evidence was discovered in Crutcher’s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man’s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon. Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users. In fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect. Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher’s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time. It is also noteworthy that Crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use, so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison. All of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated Crutcher looked “like a bad dude” who “could be on something.” It was expected that the medical examiner’s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether Crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident, along with the rest of the broader autopsy report. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that PCP was found in Terence Crutcher’s vehicle, which may explain why his actions prompted a Tulsa police officer to shoot him.

1247,"Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager. Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative. Story Continued Below “He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?” Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network. Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.” “So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked. “You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.",1,0,0
64,"A video capturing the moments leading up to and following the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has sparked days of protests across the city of Charlotte, was released by the man’s family today. A woman identified as Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott, recorded the incident with her cellphone. The footage was provided to ABC News by attorneys for the Scott family today. In the cellphone video, an SUV is seen parked in the street as police repeatedly yell at Scott to ""drop the gun."" Scott's wife, who is standing several feet away from the scene, pleads with the officers not to harm her husband. ""Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him,"" she says. ""He has no weapon. He has no weapon."" Police continue to scream at Keith Lamont Scott: ""Drop the gun! Drop the f---ing gun!"" Rakeyia Scott yells back at police, insisting her husband is harmless and doesn't have a gun. ""He doesn't have a gun,"" she says. ""He has a T.B.I. [traumatic brain injury]. He's not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine."" One officer can be heard saying, ""Let me get a f---ing baton over here."" Rakeyia Scott then yells to her husband anxiously, ""Keith, don't let them break the windows. Come out the car!"" Police order Keith Lamont Scott to ""drop the gun"" several more times as his wife screams, ""Keith! Keith! Don't you do it!"" That's when multiple gunshots ring out. The actual shooting is not shown on the video as Rakeyia Scott points her cellphone at the ground and screams, ""Did you shoot him?"" She then runs closer to the scene, angling the cellphone camera again at the spot where her husband was shot. “He better not be f---ing dead. He better not be f---ing dead,” she yells at police. “He better live. I swear, he better live.” Scott's body is seen lying in the street surrounded by several officers. ""Did you all call an ambulance?"" Scott's wife asks, before the video cuts out.     According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, Scott was treated immediately and later pronounced dead. The video is the first footage of Scott's encounter with police to be publicly released. Investigators have not released the dashboard and body camera videos. The footage is ""not great"" for investigative purposes because you don't see the officers and you don't know whom Scott's wife is speaking to or what she is referring to when she says, ""Don't do it,"" said former FBI Special Agent In-Charge Rich Frankel. ""You need a lot of information before you can make an informed decision,"" Frankel told ABC News. ""You have a lot of people putting out their opinions on what happened. Until you more information, it's all hyperbole and guesses."" One of the attorneys representing the Scott family, Charles G. Monnett, said they released the video ""in the name of truth and transparency."" ""The family is still hopeful that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and city of Charlotte will release all available video of the incident to the public so that people can draw their own conclusions about Keith's death,"" Monnett said. ""We encourage everyone to reserve judgment until all the facts are known. This is simply one step in our quest to find the truth for this family."" Police say Scott was holding a handgun, which investigators recovered from an apartment complex in Charlotte, and posed a threat because he was not obeying police orders to remain in his vehicle and drop the weapon. An officer subsequently fired his gun, striking Scott. Police have identified that officer as Brentley Vinson, who has been employed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department since July 21, 2014, and is currently assigned to the metro division. He has been placed on paid administrative leave as the investigation continues. Vinson was not wearing a body camera at the time, but the other officers who responded to the incident were, police said.   Scott’s family has said he was not armed and was holding a book while waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said the video evidence alone does not establish probable cause. But the ""intent"" is to publicly release the video along with other supporting evidence once it's been fully gathered. Still, the timing has to be right, he said. The probe into Scott's death has now been officially handed over to North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation, which will be in charge of providing updates and releasing further information on the status of the investigation, according to Putney.

863,"On Monday, Congressman Lee Zeldin (R-NY) took to Twitter to use the apprehension of lead suspect in the NYC bombing investigation, Ahmad Khan Rahami, to take a shot at San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in an exceptionally clumsy attempt to connect his police recent brutality protests with terrorism, writing “You are welcome” after noting that Rahami was taken into custody:  Zeldin obviously thought the tweet would give him the final say in the matter and a chance to say he thought Kaepernick was ungrateful, but the Internet had other plans. After firing off his passive aggressive swipe at  the football player, Twitter would declare open season on him and continue to to roast him after declaring his ridiculous comment the new, “Thanks, Obama.”  Like “Thanks, Obama” in which Democrats mocked how Republicans went out of their way to link extremely remote events as outcomes of President Obama’s presidency, “You’re welcome, Kaepernick” could now be used to illustrate how absurdly far the right would stretch to manufacture a situation Colin Kaepernick should be grateful for.   The tweet made it to several verified accounts, most notably reaching host of Matter of Fact TV’s Soledad O’Brien. All in all, we can probably guess this is not how Congressman Zeldin planned on this tweet working out for him. Lets hope this bully learns his humiliating lesson, and stop trying to exploit a national scare to increase his national profile.   ",0,1,0
695,"Hillary Clinton appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Monday evening, an appearance which was precipitated by Donald Trump’s appearance with the late night comic last Thursday. Both programs were ratings bonanzas with Trump’s program averaging a 2.6 rating share and Clinton’s program averaging a 2.8 rating share, the best rating The Tonight Show has had in five months. Clinton also scored higher ratings than Trump among adults who are between 18-49 with a 0.9 rating vs. Trump who garnered a 0.7 rating with this age group. While Hillary Clinton’s Tonight Show visit may have marginally defeated Trump’s in the ratings war, the program featuring the Democratic nominee for president was far less entertaining than that of her Republican challenger. With the exception of few moments, such as Fallon’s opening the interview by wearing a surgical mask and using hand sanitizer in reference to Clinton’s recent bout with pneumonia, the interview was not that funny. Fallon also had another good moment when he handed Clinton the bag which Trump “left in his dressing room” which contained a picture of Vladimir Putin in a heart shaped frame, a CD of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” and an actual bag of softballs, a reference to the media accusing Fallon of doing a” softball interview “with Trump. Why the media expects a late night comic to conduct hard hitting interviews is a question for another day. While Fallon certainly was trying, Clinton did not appear to want to stay within the confines of a humorous exchange for very long. Clinton quickly steered a conversation that started off about the importance of her legacy as the first female nominee for president to one where she was attacking Trump. She went after Trump for “refusing to admit that President Obama is an American.” She also criticized him for his past comments where he referred to a Federal Judge, Gonzolo Curiel, who is an American of Mexican descent as a Mexican. Clinton also brought up Trump’s exchange with the Khans, the Muslim Gold Star family who criticized Trump’s immigration policy. The irony of Clinton’s Trump rampage was that she opened her conversation with Fallon by saying that she wanted focus on the issues and dispense with the rhetoric. Politicians and political candidates appear on entertainment programs to showcase their human side. Bill Clinton famously played the sax on The Arsenio Hall Show over twenty years ago. Clinton missed a tremendous opportunity to connect with the American people on a different level, to show them that she has a sense of humor and that she doesn’t take herself too seriously. Last fall, she appeared on Saturday Live as a bartender in a humorous skit. Recently, she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live where she famously opened a jar of pickles to demonstrate her health. Of course the pickle jar episode is not that funny anymore now that we know that Clinton could have been suffering from pneumonia when she taped the program. No one is saying that Hillary Clinton needed to mess up her hair, but she would have done herself a better service if she treated the Jimmy Fallon interview as exactly what it was, entertainment. Clinton will have an opportunity to go after her opponent in an appropriate forum, namely the upcoming September 26 debate.

1017,"Seeking to shake up a tight presidential race, Sen. Harry Reid declared Tuesday on the Senate floor that Donald Trump is a “swindler” who is “not as rich as he would have us believe"" — as the Nevada Democrat moved to reprise the 2012 strategy that saw him hammer Mitt Romney repeatedly over his tax returns. Several times on Tuesday, the Senate minority leader called out Trump for declining to release his tax returns, suggesting that it’s because those documents would show that Trump has far less wealth than he’s claimed. Trump has said his net worth is $10 billion. Story Continued Below “He was born with an inheritance but lost his daddy’s wealth. … That’s why Donald Trump won’t release his tax returns. That’s certainly one of the reasons, of course: He is not worth nearly as much as he claims to be. That’s a secret he doesn’t want anyone to know,” Reid said in a scathing speech. “He wants everyone to think he’s this big, rich, rich man.” With just a handful of congressional days in session before the election, Reid is unleashing increasingly heated attacks on Trump and Senate Republicans supporting him. Last week, he called Trump a “human leech” and suggested the business mogul is overweight, dropping the kinds of political bombs that most pro-Hillary Clinton Democrats wouldn’t touch. For Reid, there’s less downside than for almost all other high-profile Democratic surrogates: He’s retiring in September and is looking to make as much of a mark on the race as he can. In a sit-down interview on Monday, he emphasized that Trump cannot sustain a charge in the polls that now has him closer than ever to catching Clinton, declaring that “American polling is such a joke.” “I’ve always been a pessimist; that’s just my nature,” Reid said in his office. “Despite my base pessimism, I’m convinced that this election is turning. What Trump has done in the last couple weeks, you can’t overcome that. You can’t do it.” While Reid has previously lit into Trump for his business dealings, his comments about income taxes on Tuesday are reminiscent of Reid’s efforts to paint Romney as a tax dodger in 2012, when Reid repeatedly came to the floor to declare that Romney did not pay any income taxes. Although his claims were ultimately unproven, Reid has never shown any remorse for his attacks on Romney, and in fact on Tuesday showed that he believes the tactics are effective enough to use again on Trump. Quoting Trump, Reid said that the GOP presidential nominee’s personal wealth fluctuates with the financial markets — which Reid said is cover for a man he said would be “scammer in chief.” “Simply put, Trump is faking his net worth because he doesn’t want us to know that he’s not a good businessman,” Reid said. “Since 2008, Trump has not donated a single penny to his own charity … does he have money to donate? He says he does, but he doesn’t.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And Republicans aren’t exactly rushing to shield Trump from Reid’s attacks; many, in fact, have said that Trump should release his tax returns in accordance with presidential tradition. “I’m not going to comment about the presidential race or what our nominee should or should not do,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said Tuesday morning. Last week, Trump responded to Reid’s months-long string of attacks on him from the Senate floor, telling The Washington Post that Reid should “start working out again with his rubber workout pieces,” a reference to the devastating eye injury Reid sustained while exercising in 2015. Reid then went on a parade of media hits to strike back at Trump last week. In the interview on Monday, Reid said that because of his injury and his use of a cane, he is “pretty sensitive” to Trump’s mockery of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a disability. “He denigrates people who are handicapped. He says that he thinks I should go out and do some more exercise, suggesting that I should blind myself in my other eye,” Reid said. “I don’t think that’s really so good.”",1,0,0

1604,"Elizabeth Warren’s epic takedown of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf may be her finest moment yet. Stumpf, who is being pressured to resign from his post in the wake of a massive scandal involving the bank’s intentional fleecing of millions of customers, was just thoroughly embarrassed during a senate hearing. Every time Stumpf tried to deflect Warren’s questions, she interjected and refused to let him off the hook. Throughout her line of questioning, she used the Wells Fargo mission statement and Stumpf’s own words to shame him.  WARREN: “Since this massive, years-long scam came to light, you have said, repeatedly, ‘I am accountable.’ But what have you actually done to hold yourself accountable? Have you resigned as CEO or chairman of Wells Fargo? STUMPF: “The board I serve– WARREN: “Have you resigned?” STUMPF: “No, I have not.” WARREN: “Alright. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars you were paid while this scam was going on?” STUMPF: “Well, first of all, this was by one percent of our people, and–” WARREN: “That’s not my question. It’s about responsibility. Have you returned one nickel of the millions of dollars that you were paid while this scam was going on?” STUMPF: “The, the board will take care of that.” WARREN: “Have you returned one nickel of the money you earned while this scam was going on?” STUMPF: “And, and the board will do–” WARREN: “I’ll take that as a no, then. And have you fired a single senior executive, and by that, I don’t mean a regional manager or branch manager. I’m asking about the people who actually led your community banking division or your compliance division.” STUMPF: “We’ve made a change in our regional, to lead our regional bank.” WARREN: “I just said I’m not talking about regional managers, I’m not asking about branch managers. I’m asking if you have fired senior management. The people who actually led the community banking division, who oversaw this fraud, or the compliance division who was in charge of making sure that the bank complied with the law. Did you fire any of those people?” STUMPF: “No.” WARREN: “No. OK. So you haven’t resigned. You haven’t returned a single nickel of your personal earnings. You haven’t fired a single senior executive. Instead, evidently, your definition of ‘accountable’ is to push the blame to your low-level people who don’t have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves. It’s gutless leadership.” Wells Fargo was fined nearly $200 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau earlier this month for perpetuating an ongoing scam of opening accounts and credit cards on behalf of customers without their knowledge or consent, then proceeding to fine those customers late fees and overdraft charges in order to drive sales numbers higher. As of this writing, CEO and chairman John Stumpf has not been criminally charged for his bank’s actions.        ",0,1,0
886,"GQ journalist Drew Magary just penned a brutal takedown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and all of his supporters in an amusing and accurate – if rather profane – fashion. With fury and wit, Magary uses to article to exorcize the Trump demons in his heart, admitting that “Nothing’s gonna take down Trump at this point, so I’m not gonna bother. No no, this post is for ME. I am preaching to the sad little choir in my soul here.” The torrent of abuse he pours upon Trump and his far-right supporters are things that we all would love to scream at every car with a Trump sticker on it, at obnoxious Twitter handle with a smug Pepe The Nazi frog winking at you hurling racial slurs at you, every relative who launches into Benghazi conspiracies at Thanksgiving, at your jaded friend who just “can’t bring himself to vote this year,” at the sycophantic pundits that cut away from the President to a Trump rally…this is for all of them. Because while Trump is a miserable bastard, YOU are the people who have handed him the bullhorn. YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit. YOU are the people who want to revolutionize the way America does business by voting for its worst businessman, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when he causes problems for other people instead of solving them. YOU are the thin-skinned yokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs at you (“deplorables”), while cheering Trump on as he leaves a bonfire of truly hateful invective everywhere he goes. YOU are the people willing to overlook the fact that Trump is an unqualified, ignorant sociopath because DURRRR HILLARY IS BAD TOO DURRRR.   Trump is human waste. He is the worst of America stuffed into a nacho cheese casing, and he is emblematic of the kind of arrogant, flag-waving, trashy, racist moron that the rest of us have to DRAG kicking and screaming into the 21st century: Cliven Bundy, Sean Hannity, Kim Davis, and on and on and on. Trump voters are the people who have spent the past decade or so voting insipid obstructionists into office, sending death threats to anyone who even mentions the idea of gun control, demanding 100% tax cuts on millions of dollars they can only daydream about making, and getting suckered in by any Oil Party candidate waving a NO GAYS flag. Fuck them. These are needy hillbilly loons who are just as starved for attention as Trump himself. And voting for Trump is their way of emulating him, of saying FUCK YOU to everyone else as a mission statement, with no regard for the fallout.  If you vote for him, you’re not making America great again. You are killing it. You are telling the world that America isn’t worth it. You are telling the world that all of our big talk about freedom and unity and ideals is just a load of shit, and that you would prefer a smoldering dystopia where freedom is just a flimsy cover for evildoing, led by a man who believes that strength is measured only in killing people. You are handing the most important job on Earth to Napoleon from Animal Farm. And you are revealing your breathtaking ignorance to everyone except for yourself. I can’t believe you can’t see this. I want you to see this. I wanna shine a big fucking light in your face and scream at you that Trump isn’t even qualified to be human, much less President. How are you gonna change the system if you elect some corrupt idiot who has no clue how to DO IT, huh? Can’t you see this? Haven’t you heard this asshole talk? THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

1228,"Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton. “The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents.

I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody.” “Nobody should be fooled!” she snidely added in a voice so ear-splittingly loud that even deaf laborers most likely heard it. Throughout the rest of the video, she maintained that same flair — the unnecessary indignation for her opponent, GOP candidate Donald Trump.

485,"Washington (CNN)Two decades later, Hillary Clinton is still haunted by the ghosts of NAFTA. Labor unions and liberal activists are preparing to highlight free trade — an issue central to Bill and Hillary Clinton's political brand in the early 1990s — if she opts to run for president in 2016. Driving their anger: The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive new pact that that would usurp the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement's place as the biggest-ever free trade agreement. President Barack Obama's administration has been negotiating the Chile-to-Japan deal for years, and it's increasingly drawing scrutiny from the Democratic base as the talks near completion. The new deal has reminded labor halls across the country of the old one — and that it was their biggest problem with the Clintons. Compounding the problem is that free trade, particularly NAFTA, is an issue that Clinton has vacillated on since her husband's administration. As first lady, Clinton backed NAFTA and spoke highly of it at stops for the administration. But once she was elected to the Senate and later ran for president, her support of free trade -- and her husband's landmark agreement -- began to wane. On the campaign trail, Clinton acknowledged that NAFTA has ""hurt a lot of American workers"" and advocated for broad reform of trade policy. President Barack Obama's campaign even used the flip-flop against Clinton during the 2008 primary. But after Clinton lost the nomination and agreed to serve as the President's Secretary of State, she began to warm up to free trade, and particularly the TPP. In her memoir, which Clinton's spokesman said was her most updated statement on the TPP, Clinton wrote, ""It's safe to say that the TPP won't be perfect. No deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be - but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers."" That history worries some labor leaders who are prepared to hold Clinton to a standard that includes her support of free trade agreements. Hillary Clinton: Dodging tough questions should be 'disqualifying' in Iowa AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told CNN the issue of free trade could hang over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont says he'll make it a centerpiece of his campaign if he runs for president. And union workers across the country - including some who lined up to see Clinton speak at a labor hall in 2014 - are talking about it, too. ""I think NAFTA itself will be remembered for as long as this generation draws a warm breath,"" Richard Trumka said in an interview. ""When I talk to people about it, they don't remember that it was a Republican majority that passed NAFTA. They remember that it was President Clinton."" Labor leaders see Clinton's 1994 signing of NAFTA, which created a free-trade zone with Canada and Mexico, as the moment when blue collar wages began to stagnate. Trumka said that free trade -- especially the TPP -- is one of the biggest priorities for the AFL-CIO and something that the group will use to gauge their support of candidates in 2015 and 2016. The issue is part of the group's ""Raising Wages"" priority plan which looks to raise the wages of all Americans. The longtime labor leader, whose relationship with the Clintons goes back decades, said it was up to Hillary Clinton whether the legacy of NAFTA will hurt her campaign. ""It all depends on what her position is on trade. If her position on trade is that NAFTA is really a good thing and I want to continue it, it will definitely hurt her,"" he said. ""All politicians, Democrats and Republicans, take about raising wages. But you can't be for raising wages while being for the same old trade policies."" That's where the Trans-Pacific Partnership — which liberal activists have taken to calling ""NAFTA on steroids"" — comes in. 7 things Hillary Clinton says at almost every speech Free trade won't go away in 2016 It isn't only Trumka, though, that will likely apply pressure on Clinton regarding free trade. Two outspoken liberal senators -- both of whom have been followed by 2016 speculation -- have come out strong against the TPP. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, came out against the TPP earlier in 2014 and recently wrote a letter that accused the White House of crafting the deal in secret. In an interview, the outspoken senator that while the concept of trade ""is a good idea,"" trade agreements like NAFTA and TPP have been raw deals for American workers. ""It was very clear to me that any agreement that forces American workers to compete against desperate, desperate people who are working for pennies an hour is grotesquely unfair,"" Sanders said, recalling the 1990s when he traveled to Mexico to see the working and living conditions of workers producing goods sold in the U.S. Unlike some labor and liberal leaders, Sanders does not hang NAFTA on Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton was not the president. Bill Clinton was the president,"" he said. ""Hillary will have to speak to her own views on trade."" That said, though, Sanders has brought free trade up on every trip he has made to Iowa -- the first-in-the-nation caucus state -- and when asked whether he would make the issue a key part of his possible presidential run he bluntly said: ""I will give you a three letter answer to that - the answer is y-e-s."" Why many liberals don't trust Hillary Clinton Joining Sanders is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who told an AFL-CIO audience recently that liberals ""believe in trade policies and tax codes that will strengthen our economy, that will raise our standard of living, that will create American jobs because we will never give up on these three words: made in America."" Warren has also written a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Mike Froman questioning the deal. The fact that Warren and Sanders are involved means this issue is not going away, especially for Clinton. Both represent the former first lady's left flank and are politicians who don't even need to run for president to dictate some of the issues that become big campaign issues. Clinton is a moving target on NAFTA Bill Clinton still defends NAFTA as a good deal for America. Just last November, at the 10th anniversary of the Clinton Library, the former President said, ""NAFTA is still controversial but people will thank me for it in 20 years."" Hillary Clinton has waffled on the issue, though. As first lady, Clinton backed NAFTA. ""I think that everybody is in favor of free and fair trade,"" she said during a meeting with union workers in 1996, ""and I think that NAFTA is proving its worth."" In her 2003 memoir, ""Living History,"" Clinton also writes glowingly about NAFTA, including it among her husband's ""legislative victories"" and noting it would ""expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization."" But when she entered the Senate in 2000 and ran for president in 2008, Clinton's tune on free trade began to change. She conducted a study as senator that found the agreement hurt New York workers' ability to sell goods in Canada and spoke out against NAFTA during her 2008 campaign. ""NAFTA and the way it's been implemented has hurt a lot of American workers,"" Clinton said at a 2007 forum with the AFL-CIO. ""Clearly we have to have a broad reform in how we approach trade. NAFTA's a piece of it, but it's not the only piece of it."" Clinton lost her race for president, though, and went on to serve as Barack Obama's secretary of state. In the role, she oversaw the President's much noted pivot to Asia. At the center of that move was the TPP. ""One of our most important tools for engaging with Vietnam was a proposed new trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property,"" Clinton wrote in her 2014 memoir ""Hard Choices."" As secretary of state, Clinton also talked up the benefits of the TPP and during a trip to Korea in 2011, she advocated for ""as few barriers to trade and investment as possible."" When asked for Clinton's current position on free trade and the TPP, a spokesman pointed CNN to what the former secretary of state wrote in her book. Iowans 'absolutely sure' Hillary Clinton is running Republicans have picked up on the problem for Clinton and have started to point out her changes in opinion. Before Clinton went to Michigan last year to endorse candidates, America Rising PAC, an anti-Clinton communication and research group, questioned Clinton's ""phony populism on free trade."" ""A peculiar thing happens every time Hillary Clinton decides to run for President,"" the group said in a blog post. ""Her views on free trade start sliding left and she calls for a 'time out' on free trade agreements."" These Republican attacks - and more likely to come - show the political problem Clinton faces. If she runs for President, she will either have to woo labor and liberal leaders by blasting agreements like TPP and NAFTA and risk looking like she is backtracking on her State Department years. Or she can embrace deals that she made at State and risk what has become eager liberal anger. TPP likely to be left for next president For all the comparisons, though, the TPP would actually be a much different -- and more comprehensive -- trade deal than NAFTA was. Older pacts have mostly dealt with moving goods into and out of countries. But in the 12-country Pacific Rim deal, U.S. negotiators are pushing for rules that would help companies -- especially pharmaceutical drug-makers -- extend their patents and copyrights for much longer periods, keeping generic medicines off poorer foreign countries' markets. They're working to create a tribunal that would give corporations a venue to challenge whether governments' rules and regulations are in line with their obligations under the trade deal. And they're crafting chapters on environmental protections, labor rights and the digital economy. They're trying to prevent countries from restricting where data servers can be located, or what data companies can move across international borders. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, like NAFTA, includes Canada and Mexico. But the deal's real pearl is Japan -- a potentially huge market for U.S. food, natural gas and more. It's a wealthy economy that American businesses haven't been able to crack. But Japan is bogged down by its own political challenges. The country's agricultural interests are especially influential in its legislature, and they've resisted opening their ports to American rice, beef, pork and wheat -- which, in turn, has infuriated U.S. farmers. For more than a year, it's been a huge sticking point that has delayed progress on the deal. That's why the Trans-Pacific Partnership debate isn't going away. Trade agreements take years to come together. Even after the presidents and prime ministers announce they've struck a deal, the wording must be scrubbed and translated into each country's language -- a process that takes months. Then legislatures, where anger about their lack of a role in the negotiations has often simmered for years, might insist on changes. Different countries' elections and changing political tides can complicate things even more. For some senators, the minority will be more fun The best-case scenario for Obama is that the Trans-Pacific Partnership could be approved by Congress at the very end of his presidency. And that's if a deal can be struck soon -- which is unlikely. Negotiators already blew their goal of reaching an agreement in 2012. Then they missed their own deadline in 2013. And again in 2014. Much more likely is that the next president will have decisions to make about whether and how to finalize the negotiations -- or, at least, whether to sign the deal. ",1,0,0
303,"Greensboro, North Carolina (CNN)Donald Trump declined Tuesday to answer reporters' questions about his sudden shift on the issue of President Barack Obama's birthplace. Trump ignored reporters' questions during a stop at a restaurant here, the first opportunity journalists covering his campaign have had to ask the Republican nominee about his reversal on the issue. In a brief statement on Friday, Trump asserted that he now believed Obama was born in the US and then refused to answer reporters' questions after the press event, which campaign aides told media members would be a press conference. For years, Trump was one of the most prominent and vocal pushers of the ""birther"" conspiracy theory that falsely claimed Obama was not born in the US. Obama produced his long-form birth certificate in 2011 that proved he was born in Hawaii. While Trump surrogates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have falsely asserted in recent days that Trump dropped his birtherism in recent years, Trump declined numerous opportunities to disavow his previous support of the conspiracy theory. In the two weeks before his sudden statement on Friday, Trump was asked four times about his birther beliefs -- and Trump declined each opportunity to disavow the falsehood or his role in pushing that conspiracy theory. Trump spent Tuesday campaigning in the battleground state of North Carolina, where the latest polls show him in a dead heat with Hillary Clinton. ",1,0,0
997,"Donald Trump’s campaign is claiming vindication after one of Hillary Clinton’s longtime confidants was accused last week of spreading false rumors about Barack Obama’s origins during the 2008 Democratic primary. But the real story turns out to be a little more complicated, and does nothing to prove Trump’s argument that Clinton and her campaign “started” the so-called birther controversy. Story Continued Below Last Thursday, after former McClatchy editor James Asher tweeted that Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal “told me in person” that Obama was born in Kenya, the Trump campaign pounced. “SIREN: Former McClatchy DC Bureau Chief speaks out,” senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted. McClatchy followed up with a story that quoted a statement from Asher, “During that meeting, Mr. Blumenthal and I met together in my office and he strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of President Obama’s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya. We assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and that reporter determined that the allegation was false.” Blumenthal swiftly denied pushing any birther rumors. And Asher, when pressed for more detail, was less definitive in an email to POLITICO. “To the best of my recollection, these are the facts about my interaction with Sidney Blumenthal in late winter of 2008,” Asher said. “Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy, where he and I met in my office. During that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to Obama. He encouraged McClatchy to do stories related to Obama and his connections to Kenya.” “On the birther issue, I recall my conversation with Blumenthal clearly,” Asher said, but acknowledged having “nothing in writing memorializing that conversation.” “This story is false,” Blumenthal reiterated in an email. “I never spoke to Mr. Asher about this. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the inescapable fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and is responsible for it.” “Well I still have his biz card. So it's his word against mine,” Asher tweeted on Friday after other news outlets published Blumenthal’s initial denial. But two other former McClatchy staffers, including McClatchy’s Nairobi correspondent at the time, Shashank Bengali, said they were aware that Asher and Blumenthal were in touch. “Sid was definitely speaking to Asher,” Bengali said. Bengali, who is now a Los Angeles Times correspondent based in Mumbai, said he had been asked to investigate “Obama’s Kenya ties” at Blumenthal’s behest, but couldn’t remember whether anyone had asked him “to check out the birther angle specifically. No one in Kenya took that seriously."" “What I remember is that you told me to look into everything about Obama's family in Kenya. I can't recall if we specifically discussed the birther claim, but I'm sure that was part of what I researched,” Bengali said in an email to Asher that was shared with POLITICO. Bengali interviewed Obama's siblings and friends of his father, but came up empty. “There was nothing there. We didn't even publish a story,"" he said. Blumenthal won’t say if the meeting with Asher ever happened, but did not deny urging him in an email to have Bengali report on whether Obama had offended Kenyans by making disparaging remarks about his late father, an economist who once worked for the Kenyan government. The email, which was dated March 17, 2008, and shared with POLITICO, reads: ""Jim, on Kenya your person in the field might look into the impact there of Obama's public comments about his father. I'm told by State Dept officials that Obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing and crossing the line by Kenyans for whom respect for elders (especially the father, especially a Muslim father, in a patrilineal society) is considered sacrosanct. Sidney"" Asher says he also asked Bengali, after discussing the matter with Blumenthal, to look into “any connections between Obama and Raila Odinga, who had described himself as Obama’s cousin and would run for president of Kenya; and, second, possible relationships between Odinga and unspecified controversial Muslim groups.” Asked about the email, Blumenthal would not clarify the nature of his interactions with Asher. But he wrote, “What you sent has nothing to do with birtherism at all. It is untrue I had anything to do with birtherism. Obama's relationship with his father is at the heart of his memoir, ‘Dreams of My Father,’ and has been a commonplace subject of interest for everyone.” Nor would Blumenthal say if he had discussed ties between Obama and Odinga with Asher. “I can say with certainty that I never trafficked in birtherism,” he repeated when asked. Blumenthal sent along an email he sent to friends in February 2011, pointing to POLITICO’s write-up of a poll showing that half of Republican primary voters at the time that Obama was born abroad. He said his subject line -- “It's official: they're nuts” -- “reflects my constant view of the matter.” He also pointed to a series of tweets Asher made in which he attacked Clinton in strident terms and used a pro-Trump hashtag. ”#Snowden should be pardoned since #hillary wasn't #indicted. Only fair! #wikileaks #Election2016,” one tweet reads. “#HillaryClinton #Election2016 #TrumpPence16 Note Colin #Powell's reference to #HRC's #‘character,’"" reads another. A third tweet reads: “What is really going on with #HillaryClinton? #Election2016 #HillarysHealth.” Asked about those tweets on Monday, Asher said, “I support neither Trump nor Clinton. It would be incorrect to read support for Trump into my tweets about Clinton.” The conflicting accounts came after Trump on Friday accused Clinton of starting what he called “the ‘birther’ controversy” -- a campaign of scurrilous rumor-mongering that he did more than anyone to stoke, only to concede last week that he was mistaken. The Clinton campaign’s response to Trump’s charge came fast and furious, and POLITICO found no evidence to suggest that the former secretary of state or her 2008 operation ever trafficked in birther rumors. ""As multiple, independent fact checkers have affirmed in the years since, neither the 2008 campaign nor the candidate ever questioned the president's citizenship or birth certificate,” Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said when asked about Blumenthal, who was never paid by the 2008 Clinton campaign. Indeed, Clinton’s former campaign manager, Patty Solis Doyle, told CNN on Friday that she fired a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who had forwarded a birther-esque email, calling it “so beyond the pale of the campaign Hillary wanted to run.” Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of both Bill and Hillary Clinton, emerged as a frequent correspondent in the former secretary of state’s email records, peppering her with hundreds of notes offering advice, sharing tart observations about her administration rivals, or passing along articles and “intelligence” reports from his contacts. He also sometimes boasted of having planted articles in the press on her behalf, though there is no evidence that she ever asked him to do so. Blumenthal’s relationship with the Clintons dates back to their battles with the right-wing media during the 1990s, in which he was a sharp-elbowed participant. After writing a well-received book about those years, “The Clinton Wars,” he returned briefly to journalism before playing an informal advisory role during the 2008 campaign. He sought a job in the State Department when Clinton was named secretary of state, but White House aides blacklisted him due to his role in pushing negative stories about Obama during the Democratic primary. He remained in the Clinton orbit, however: In 2009, the Clinton Foundation put him on its staff and paid him $10,000 per month, though the arrangement ended in March 2015. Blumenthal then did consulting work for American Bridge, Correct the Record and Media Matters, three groups that support Clinton’s presidential bid and are run by another close Clinton ally, David Brock. In a portion of a deposition that was accidently put online, Blumenthal told a congressional committee that he was paid around $200,000 by the Brock groups. Hillary Clinton has never repudiated Blumenthal, though she has distanced herself from him, while he has continued to be her ardent defender. As recently as May, he described himself as a “friend” of Clinton’s, though he did not say whether they still exchange emails. In her testimony before the House Benghazi Committee last year, Clinton described him as a “personal friend” but downplayed the extent to which she relied on him for advice as secretary of state. ""He was not advising me,"" Clinton told the committee. ""I did not ask him to send me the information that he sent me,"" she said, though the emails show that she did sometimes thank him for the information or ask him to “please keep them coming.” She also sometimes forwarded his emails and asked State Department officials to look into his findings. During her subsequent interview with the FBI, Clinton described him as “a prodigious writer whose information was sometimes accurate and sometimes not,” according to the bureau’s report summarizing its investigation into her private email server. When Blumenthal’s emails first emerged, Clinton was slightly less circumspect. “He sent me unsolicited emails, which I passed on in some instances, and I say that that’s just part of the give and take,” she told reporters last year. “I have many, many old friends and I always think that it’s important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what’s on their minds,” Clinton said. “And he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.”",1,0,0
745,"To anyone paying attention last night it was clear that Hillary did not win the debate against Trump. Sure, Trump was brash and he’s not your normal politician, but the fact of the matter is he demolished her on her record in front of the entire country. Nevertheless, CNN did their best to make it look like Trump lost the debate by publishing rigged polling data. From Infowars: A CNN/ORC poll released shortly after last night’s debate found that Hillary Clinton scored a clear victory over her rival Donald Trump. One problem – the survey sample included 41% Democrats compared to just 26% Republicans. Asked, “Who do you think did the best job in the debate – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?”, 62% of respondents said Hillary while 27% said Trump. This immediately gave the impression that Hillary trounced Trump in the debate, and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the Republican candidate. However, 33% of the people surveyed in the poll identified as Independents, 41% identified as Democrats, while just 26% identified as Republicans. This represents a disparity of 15% between Democrats and Republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of Democrats before the question about who won the debate was even asked.  Almost three quarters of the respondents were not Republicans and 57% more Democrats were asked than Republicans. If the sampling was flipped, with 41% of respondents being Republican and just 26% identifying as Democrats, the outcome would almost certainly have been in Trump’s favor.              I think you get the point by now…Donald crushed Hillary in last night’s debate! ",0,0,1

1049,"WILLIAMSBURG, Va. — Mike Pence stood with no umbrella before about 650 die-hard supporters in an at times torrid rain Tuesday night, and delivered his stump speech over the chants of protesters less than 100 yards from the stage. It was a dramatic scene here in this colonial village/college town, as the skies opened up but did not deter Donald Trump’s running mate. Story Continued Below “You people are awesome,” Pence told the crowd as he took the stage while a steady rain poured down. He acknowledged it was a “moist evening.” When he prepared to leave the stage just over 20 minutes later to work the rope line, he conceded the night was “soggy.” “Tonight, we’re showing the media and showing the world this is a movement that’s going to elect Donald Trump as the next president of the United States,” Pence told the crowd. The outdoor rally meant vulnerability not only to the weather, but also to local permitting ordinances. A throng of about a dozen protesters with Clinton-Kaine signs stood just behind the press pen and sought repeatedly to disrupt the speech. “Pro women, pro choice!” the group chanted at one point. “Monica!” a man yelled at them. At another point the group shouted, “We are all immigrants!” “You’re all idiots!” a man nearby retorted. A chant of “You are racist!” morphed seamlessly into an “America’s already great!” chant. But whenever Pence, in a soaking wet suit, hit his applause lines, the crowd drowned out the protesters. Pence stuck to the message he has been hammering since the weekend, accusing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of a foreign policy that opened the doors for the kinds of terrorist attacks that hit New York, New Jersey and Minnesota on Saturday. “You know, theirs is narrative of denial,” Pence said of the administration and the Democrats. “Truth of the matter is we need a president who understands we are in a real fight against terrorists, against radical Islamic terrorism, against the ISIS caliphate. And when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we will take the fight to the enemy, we will destroy ISIS at its source and we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism wherever it emerges.” After the speech, Pence got a change of clothes and delivered towels to damp reporters on the back of his plane. He spoke with Trump by phone after the rally, he said. “Six hundred and fifty people standing in the pouring rain,” Pence said. “I told him, we’re going to win Virginia.”",1,0,0

1558,"Like father like daughter. Just sayin’. On the day that Al Sharpton is due here in Tulsa to try and gin up riots, I read that his daughter has run into a snag on her $5 million lawsuit against New York City. You see, once upon a time, two years ago, Dominique Sharpton decided to cross the street in the Big Apple. She claims she stepped into a pothole and heard a loud snap. And so commenced Sharpton Jr’s lawfare. There seems to be a number of problems with Dominique’s lawsuit and her attempt at becoming an instant millionaire. First off, when she went to the emergency room, nothing was broken. Drat! But she sued anyway citing physical therapy and emotional distress. She had to exist in a therapeutic boot and have ligament surgery… allegedly. But of course, that’s not the end of the story by a long shot.  From the Independent Review Journal: Nearly two years ago, on October 2nd, 2014, Sharpton said that she suffered an injury while crossing the street in New York City. She says that she stepped into a pothole in the street at the intersection of Broome St. and Broadway, at which point she heard “a snap.” Soon afterward, Sharpton pursued a lawsuit against the city, citing continued pain and suffering. Her medical records showed a visit to the emergency room (nothing was broken), physical therapy, some time in a therapeutic boot, and ligament surgery. But as the details of her $5 million lawsuit came out, people began to notice that she wasn’t exactly behaving like someone who was in constant pain: Sharpton was dancing at her father’s 60th birthday celebration just hours after her horrific accident… in high heels. She’s made constant trips to Miami to be with her love interest and best of all… she went hiking in Bali. A judge has now ordered she cannot delete the photos that she stupidly posted to Instagram. Double drat!! It’s getting harder and harder for a budding shyster to make a living these days. Dominique claimed that she could only wear heels for a very short period of time. On her hike in Bali, she claims you couldn’t see that she was helped constantly by comrades and had to take frequent breaks. My heart breaks, I tell ya. She also lamented her inability to “dive off a diving board, go skiing, or go run marathons.” Now comes the hysterical part… When city attorney Michelle Fox asked Sharpton if she had been a marathon runner prior to her accident, Sharpton replied: “Not necessarily. But if I, you know, if I needed to do it and I was exercising or something like that, I was capable of it. Now, I can’t.” It sounds like a very bad joke, but unfortunately it is not. The judge should dismiss this frivolous lawsuit and send Sharpton a bill. Tell her daddy he can pay for it… he won’t. He never does pay his bills and corruption is a family pastime.   ",0,0,1

As a Conservative and Republican, I live in the real world, where I deal with statistics. The math around black teen criminality would make me a fool not to cross the street when I see black teens. Liberals suspend reality, because they must in order to rationalize their nonsense.

5,"Donald Trump's surrogates and leading supporters on Sunday were pushing a narrative that the Republican candidate started two days earlier when he declared that Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign ""started the birther controversy,"" meaning the false notion that President Obama was born outside the United States. On CBS News’ Face the Nation on Sunday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway pushed the claim that so-called ""birtherism"" began with the Clinton 2008 campaign by invoking the words of former Clinton campaign manager Patti Sollis Doyle. “Even Patti Solis Doyle, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2008 ... until she was fired by Hillary Clinton, admitted on Friday ... that she said, yes, these are her words: There was a volunteer in Iowa who was pushing this,” Conway said. Sollis Doyle, in an interview on CNN, said a volunteer coordinator had forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy. But she said that person was immediately fired and that the birther conspiracy theory was never promoted by Clinton herself.     Conway also mentioned a memo circulated by Mark Penn when he was chief strategist for Clinton’s 2008 campaign that talked about Obama’s lack of American roots. Penn wrote a memo in 2007 saying that Obama’s foreign background could present a weakness for him and that Clinton should emphasize her middle-class Midwestern upbringing. ""His roots to American values and culture are at best limited,"" the memo says. ""I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and values."" But it does not say that Obama was foreign-born. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a prominent Trump supporter, also invoked Sollis Doyle’s comments and then downplayed Trump's role in promoting the idea that Obama wasn't born in the U.S. ""It's not true that he kept it up for five years,” Christie said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “It wasn't like he was talking about it on a regular basis."" Similarly, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus in an interview on ""Face the Nation"" said he thinks the ""birther"" movement ""was something that got started in the 2008 presidential campaign ... By the preponderance of evidence before us, Hillary Clinton, or her campaign, were definitely involved in this issue."" Trump himself gave a short statement on Friday morning, at an event under the glittering chandeliers of his newest hotel, in an attempt to reverse his long-held assertion that there is uncertainty surrounding the location of President Obama's birth. “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,” the Republican presidential nominee said. Trump's statement Friday came just a day after he refused to acknowledge to the Washington Post that Obama was born in the U.S. And for years, Trump had helped perpetuate conspiracy theories about whether the first black president is wholly American and in fact born in Hawaii -- as his public birth certificate says, an attack many, including Clinton, have said is racially charged. In an August 2013 interview with ABC News' Jon Karl, for example, Trump stood behind his push to reveal Obama's ""true birth status."" Karl asked, ""You don't acknowledge that you went overboard on this whole birther stuff?"" Trump replied, ""Actually, I think it made me very popular, if you want to know the truth, OK? So I do think I know what I'm doing.""",1,0,0
466,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are still hours away from squaring off in the first debate of the 2016 race, but the pre-debate spin between each campaign is already well underway. Here's a glimpse at the expectations game waged by campaign surrogates who made the television rounds Monday morning. Trump 'can't hide' - Clinton running mate Tim Kaine at a rally Monday ""The thing about 90 minutes is boy, you can't hide. Now Donald Trump likes to say, you know, 'I'm going to build this wall, then I'm not taking any questions,' but okay, when you've got 90 minutes and there's just a moderator and two of you on stage, you can run but you can't hide."" Moderators on notice - Trump running mate Mike Pence on Hugh Hewitt's radio show ""My confident hope in the debate tonight and our debate and the other two presidential debates (is that) the moderators will ask the questions and they'll allow the candidates to answer the questions. And the rest of you people afterwards can do all the commentating and let the American people decide."" Fact-checker - Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon on CNN's ""New Day"" ""There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone should be able to call him out -- (debate moderator) Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too. But I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching, that are grading the candidates' performances should take it into account."" He'll 'be himself' - Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller on CNN's ""New Day"" ""Mr. Trump is going to be very prepared for this evening, but the key point to make about Mr. Trump is that he's going to go in there with the clarity and conviction of a candidate who knows exactly what his vision is, exactly how he wants to help the country. And so he's going to go in there and essentially be himself. And that's something that's really easy to prepare for. Secretary Clinton has a much bigger challenge, she's trying to program all of her lines and figure out what poll-tested methods are going to work tonight."" Just the facts - Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, appearing on NBC's ""Today"" show: ""All that we're asking from Donald Trump is that he stick with the facts, that he give clear plans and that he have a command of the issues. That's how we think the candidates should be judged. ""That's how they've been judged in the past. What we don't want to have is some kind of double standard where Donald Trump can get the most improved award but Hillary Clinton is getting judged on the fine points of policy."" Lowering expectations - Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, appearing on NBC's ""Today"" show ""Robby and I are living in parallel universes. Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been talking to the media for a week now saying it's your job to make sure that Donald Trump is checked -- fact-checked in real time. I'm just surprised the campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. ""Look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot.

99,"Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban sat down with 88 WABCâs Bernie and Sid on WednesdayÂ and questioned whether Donald Trump was even a billionaire. Talk about hitting the Donald where it hurts the mostâ¦. And â Cuban is even âwilling to betâ he knows how much cash Trump has on hand, while stating heâs a lot wealthier than him: âItâs not even close, I do,â Cuban said. âBefore all the Trumpians jump on me on who has more money, the reason I know is when you file your federal election campaign reports, you have to list all your cash and liquid securities and bonds. You have to list them one by one. So we know without any question that as of May 27, Donald doesnât have more than $165 million in cash and securities and bonds.â âAnd trust me, Iâve got a lot of more than that in cash, securities, and bonds,â he continued. âAnd so you know, Iâm willing to bet dimes against dollars that thatâs pretty much what heâs got.â  Cuban then went on to say he thinks Trump is acting like a âdesperateâ man trying to make money by putting his name on anything and everything. âI asked, âwhat the hell are you doing?â Are you that desperate for money?â Seriously. So when youâre putting your name on steaks, and youâre putting your name on water, youâre putting your name on playing cards, youâre putting your name on all this nonsense, right? Youâre not gonna make big bucks, no matter what. Itâs not like Trump Steaks were gonna make him $100 million. Itâs not like it was gonna make him $5 million.â Cuban does have a point. If Trump is really that successful at real estate, why then does he find himself needing to do all these other little things, half of which have gone bankrupt? Featured Image via Getty Images.

1253,"On the night of September 26, as the house lights dim in the Mack Complex at Hofstra University and the TV cameras go live, millions of Americans will be riveted to the scene. Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton’s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president? Experience suggests it’s hard to make a positive breakthrough—especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error. Story Continued Below Over the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe—a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate. Despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don’t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters’ impressions—which matters on Election Day. For both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds—which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump’s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into. 1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK Famously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation. On September 26, at the candidates’ first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked. From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question—here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history. During their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn’t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor. 2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis A more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia’s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems. Neither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that “Saturday Night Live” could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates “stood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,” wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post. Years later, Ford admitted that “I suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren’t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.” In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights. 3. 1980: Carter’s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious In politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn’t get that lesson. In front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right—someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964. While Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: “There you go again,” he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter’s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man. 4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan’s one-liner negate a serious weakness During 1984’s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer “that he had flopped.” The Wall Street Journal’s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: “New Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?” Fortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: “I will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” The audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge. 5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question Perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988. Dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” Reporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said “No, I don’t Bernard, and I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.” It was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. “It was a question about Dukakis’s values and emotions,” his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. “When he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.” 6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question During the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. “Only 10 more minutes of this crap,” Bush would later say he was thinking at the time. Checking the time would’ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did—during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates—it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him. 7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush Entering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president. During the first debate, Gore’s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush’s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat’s plans for their “fuzzy math,” Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration. At the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore’s action look odd as the audience laughed. Donna Brazile, who ran Gore’s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but “on mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing … many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.” 8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry After the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn’t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush’s record. Though Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren’t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn’t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, “Faces of Frustration,” viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush’s angry looks on the right side. *** Appearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event. And on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we’ll see what happens.",1,0,0
68,"Election Day may be more than six weeks away but, starting today, some voters can cast votes at a physical polling place as statewide in-person, no-excuse voting gets underway in Minnesota and South Dakota. With more than two-thirds of states offering some kind of early voting, the practice will trend upward in 2016, as it has in recent decades, and will play a major factor in battleground state ballots, some election experts predict. An estimated 34 percent of voters will vote early, according to Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida and fellow at the Brookings Institution. The steep climb in early voting has resulted from states’ making early voting more widely available, along with incremental year-to-year increases as voters become more familiar with early-vote procedures, McDonald told ABC News. Watch the first presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. ET. on Monday.     While all states offer absentee voting, 37 states and Washington, D.C., will allow some form of early in-person voting this year before Election Day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Early voting comprises both early absentee voting and early in-person voting. New York, South Carolina and Michigan are among the states that don't allow early, no-excuse voting. Voting early offers flexibility and convenience to voters who may not be able to show up to the polls on Nov. 8, or prefer to avoid long lines on Election Day. Whatever the motivation, early voting is likely to make up a significant chunk of the total vote in some key battleground states, Josh Putnam of the election blog Frontloading HQ told ABC News. He expects large early turnout in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina. High early-vote turnout in battleground states is borne out by data from the previous elections. In 2012, early voting made up more than half the overall vote in Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. In Georgia, early voting accounted for 48 percent of the overall 2012 vote, and in Iowa that percent grew to 43 percent in 2012, up from 35 percent in 2008. While Ohio traditionally does not have a big early vote, more than 524,000 absentee ballots had been requested as of this week, according to The Associated Press. That marks an 8 percent increase of 40,000 compared to this time in the last presidential election. Early voting in Ohio in 2012 and 2008 comprised some 30 percent of the overall vote.

406,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's rebound in national polls extends to four swing states in which he has either narrowed the margin by which he trailed Hillary Clinton or extended his lead over her, according to a new poll. A Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday shows Trump trailing by just 2 points in Colorado, a state where Clinton had opened up a wide lead and where Democrats had halted advertising. Clinton is ahead 44% to 42%, within the poll's margin of error. It's a similarly tightened race in Virginia, where ads had similarly stopped, as Clinton leads by 6 points, 45% to 39%. In Georgia, Trump is now up by 7 points, 47% to 40%, putting some distance between himself and Clinton in what is typically a reliably Republican state. And in Iowa, which has leaned in Trump's direction for the entire general election, he is also up by 7 points, 44% to 37%. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, earns 10%, 8%, 9% and 10% in Colorado, Virginia, Georgia and Iowa, respectively. ""Leads for Donald Trump in Georgia and Iowa and a virtual tie in Colorado plus a 6-point lead for Clinton in Virginia represent a major improvement overall for him in these states,"" Peter Brown, the director of the poll, said in a statement. After August, during which Clinton was posting at times double-digit national leads over Trump, the Republican nominee has closed the gap considerably and most surveys show a tight single-digit gap. Yet Clinton still has an easier path to 270 electoral votes, due in no small part to Virginia and Colorado, two states expected to be battlegrounds that Clinton had been thought to have put away early in the race. Trump would have more paths to the White House should those states become more competitive. Quinnipiac surveyed likely voters from September 13 to September 21, and the margin of error is 3.9 percentage points in Colorado and Georgia, 3.8 points in Virginia and 4 points in Iowa. Six hundred and forty-four individuals were polled in Colorado, 638 in Georgia, 659 in Virginia and 612 in Iowa. ",1,0,0
317,"Washington (CNN)Republicans are preparing for the penalty phase of the 2016 election. The next Republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman Reince Priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former GOP 2016ers who haven't yet endorsed Donald Trump: ""Get on board"" or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again. The nudge -- aimed at Republicans such as John Kasich, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush -- was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. Several Republican party chairs in early voting states told CNN that Priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 GOP candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee. Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcast ""I can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'What are you going to do about these candidates that are not keeping their promise?'"" Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann told CNN Monday. He said the Iowa state GOP receives 10 to 20 calls per week from rank-and-file Republicans wondering what, specifically, the party will do to force Kasich, Cruz and Bush to stick to their pledges and back Trump. ""If I'm hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in DC,"" said Kaufmann, who has spoken with Priebus and other Republican officials about enforcing the pledge. ""There's no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored."" A representative for Priebus didn't comment on the conversations. But his call for penalties wasn't widely embraced -- with the No. 2 House Republican breaking with Priebus Tuesday morning. ""There's a better way to unite people. I'm not a big believer that punishment unites people,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the Capitol. The California Republican added, ""If Hillary (Clinton) can't unite Republicans, I don't think anything can."" Premature conversation? Of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if Trump wins. The race between Trump and Clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the Democratic nominee still has more paths to the White House. But the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the GOP if Trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction. The anatomy of a white, working-class Trump voter ""We're watching the trailer for the GOP civil war, out in theaters November 9,"" said a top Republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with Priebus. The penalty talk spilled into the open Sunday, when Priebus told John Dickerson on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that members of the 2016 Republican presidential field who haven't yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed Trump need to ""get on board."" And for those who don't, he said future presidential bids won't ""be that easy."" ""If a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don't follow through with the promises that they made in that process,"" Priebus said, ""what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?"" Kasich's camp quickly zipped off a response accusing Priebus of putting party over principles. Kasich strategist John Weaver said the Ohio governor ""will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" Cruz brushed Priebus off Tuesday evening. ""These are serious times. I think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between Republicans,"" he said. ""My focus is on defeating Hillary Clinton and helping preserve a Senate Republican majority."" The RNC's leverage Penalties, several Republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the Republican National Committee's data and voter files -- and potentially bans from primary debates. Individual states, though, likely couldn't keep candidates off their ballots. Still, Republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging Kasich, Cruz, Bush and others to support Trump in 2016 -- not to handicap the party's presidential candidates in the future. Some said it's not even clear the RNC would have authority to impose the crackdown Priebus discussed. ""Reince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet -- and I'm not sure that the question deserves an answer. That's to be determined,"" said Matt Moore, the South Carolina GOP chairman. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn't abide by their pledges to support Trump. ""We are focused on winning back the White House and maintaining our majorities in the House and Senate,"" Walters said in an email. Donald Trump opens the personal insult vault (again) While some party honchos like Kaufmann backed Priebus' warning shot, others -- including Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges -- bristled. ""No. This is not what we are all about as a party. Besides, let's stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days,"" Borges tweeted Sunday night. Top Mitt Romney 2012 strategist Stuart Stevens tweeted: ""So idea is most popular recent Republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? Great plan."" RNC's handling of Trump The RNC's handling of Trump under Priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair -- or extends the Wisconsin operative's tenure -- shortly after the election. Then comes a swing-state governor's race in Virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where Trump's brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. And in 2020, the early stages of the Republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated Trump. It would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like Mike Pence, the Indiana governor who became Trump's running mate and chief defender, and Cruz, the Texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse Trump at his own nominating convention. ""Assuming Trump loses, there'll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party,"" said Weaver, the Kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to Priebus on Sunday. ""You're going to have off-year elections, you're going to have midterms -- some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. But you won't have any new definition of it until there's a new nominee,"" Weaver said. ""There's a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go."" Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOP Many Republicans still fault Priebus for failing to criticize Trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all Muslims from entering the United States, and believe the party could have done more to slow Trump's rise. They point out a particular irony: The party that insisted it couldn't intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who helmed Cruz's state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that ""circumstances change"" -- a reference to the pledge's creation as a tool to keep Trump from launching an independent campaign. He said he doesn't see how Priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. ""There's no provisions in the RNC rules that allow anybody to punish anybody,"" Anuzis said. ""The idea of doing that, I think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1150,"Donald Trump has taken the lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa and narrowed the former secretary of state’s advantage in Colorado and Virginia, a new Quinnipiac University poll shows. The Quinnipiac poll of likely voters in the four swing states, released Thursday, asked respondents about a four-way presidential race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Story Continued Below Trump, who trailed Clinton by 2 points in Iowa in an August Quinnipiac poll, now leads by 7 points, 44 percent to 37 percent. He also leads in Georgia, where likely voters also preferred him by a 7-point margin, 47 percent to 40 percent. Stein earned the support of 2 percent of respondents in Iowa and did not register any support in Georgia, while Johnson polled at 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Both the Clinton campaign and Priorities USA, a super PAC backing the former secretary of state, stopped airing advertisements for her in both Virginia and Colorado over the summer amid a seemingly insurmountable polling advantage. But the fresh Quinnipiac poll shows that advantage narrowed in both states. In Colorado, Clinton’s lead has shrunk from 8 points in mid-August to just 2 points in the most recent poll, 44 percent to 42 percent, with Johnson polling at 10 percent and Stein at 2 percent. Clinton's lead in Colorado falls within the poll’s margin of error, putting the two candidates in a statistical tie in the state. In Virginia, the 9-point advantage Clinton held over Trump last month has shrunk to 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent, in the poll released Thursday. Johnson earned the support of 8 percent of respondents from Virginia while Stein polled at 1 percent there. The new polls are the latest in an array of positive swing-state news for the Manhattan billionaire, who has polled well in purple states of late. A Fox News poll out Wednesday showed Trump with leads in Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada and a Suffolk University poll released earlier in the day Thursday put Trump narrowly ahead of Clinton. The news has been better for the former secretary of state in nationwide polls. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday afternoon put Clinton ahead of Trump by 6 points among likely voters across the country. But even if likely voters nationwide prefer Clinton, Trump could still carve a path to the White House with wins in key swing states. The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from Sept. 13-21 via landlines and cellphones. It reached 644 likely Colorado voters and 638 Georgians likely to vote, both with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points. The poll also reached 612 Iowans, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 points, and 659 likely Virginia voters, with a with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.9 points.",1,0,0
1338,"Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches. In a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an ""iron-clad commitment"" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects. Story Continued Below Late Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint. ""The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,"" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday. Pelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill. With Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans. Earlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure — which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 — because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint. McConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold. ""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,"" McConnell said. ""That's certainly an option worth discussing."" Informed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint. But other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. ""If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,” said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin. “There's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,” Durbin added. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. “I doubt that we would turn that down,” he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction. Senate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month. “Why do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood — sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out — for Flint when there’s a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?” argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana. Still, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical. Meanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint. McConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly. Among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly. Thirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank. Heather Caygle, Rachael Bade and Annie Snider contributed to this story.",1,0,0
439,"Washington (CNN)US and allied warplanes have sunk over 100 ISIS boats, destroying 65 of them in September alone, according to the international military coalition. While Iraq is nearly entirely land-locked, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that cross that country are navigable, and ISIS has been using watercraft for a variety of purposes, including transporting fighters and conducting improvised explosive attacks.\ The US-led anti-ISIS coalition provided CNN with video of a September 10 airstrike against an ISIS tactical unit aboard a boat near Bayji, Iraq. Barges, skiffs and motorized watercraft have been observed operating along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for the purpose of ferrying ISIS fighters and equipment across the rivers, Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Col. Joseph Scrocca told CNN, adding that it happens often when anti-ISIS Iraqi troops control the area's bridges. Coalition bombs have also targeted bridges used by ISIS, thereby further necessitating the terror group's reliance on boats. ""They have also been used by Daesh for waterborne improvised explosive device attacks,"" the spokesperson added, using another name for the terror group. A US Apache attack helicopter in July destroyed one such waterborne IED, a boat full of explosives. The vessel was attempting to remove a newly built Iraqi bridge spanning the Tigris River, according to the US military. ""It destroyed the boat so it didn't go attack the bridge,"" US Army Col. Christopher Garver, a spokesman for the military coalition against ISIS, told reporters in August. But while the US and its allies have been striking ISIS boats for months, the last few weeks have seen a major uptick in the number that have been sunk, with over 50 destroyed on September 16 and 14. Those strikes occurred near the towns of Qayyara and Sultan Abdallah, which lie along the Tigris River south of the ISIS-held city of Mosul. Experts think that the increase in the rate of strikes is tied to the upcoming effort by the US and Iraq to retake Mosul, which military officials have said could start as early as October. As part of its defensive efforts, ""ISIS is going to try and move fighters up and down the river,"" retired US Navy Cdr. Chris Harmer told CNN. Harmer thinks the US is attempting to scuttle the ISIS vessels in particular so that the group can't position its forces via the water. The Tigris River runs directly through the heart of Mosul, dividing Iraq's second-largest city in two. He also called the boats an ""easy target in terms of avoiding civilian casualties"" for the US. ISIS, he said, might try to destroy bridges to slow the Iraqi military's assault on Mosul, noting that ""a speedboat with 1,000 kilograms of explosives going into a bridge"" is a lot harder to defend against than a conventional IED that would have to be set by ISIS operatives on foot. Historically control of the two rivers has been critical to Iraqi military campaigns. During World War I, the British used small armed river boats traveling up the Tigris and Euphrates in its campaign against the Ottoman Turks. Harmer, now the senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, said that the Iraqi military had never really mastered riverine warfare -- fighting on the river -- making the coalition's support all the more essential. And despite the large number of boats sunk, Harmer thinks ISIS may have no trouble seizing additional vessels from Iraqi fishermen, farmers and others who have used the river for thousands of years. ""There's always been a steady state of traffic flow on the river,"" Harmer said. ",1,0,0
1545,"The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.   Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children. “Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”   Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting. Officials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in Charlotte.   ",0,0,1
1160,"Police robots are all over the news. Early Monday morning, FBI agents and New Jersey police officers used a bomb-squad robot to try to defuse the makeshift bombs found near a train station in Elizabeth. (The explosives ended up detonating after police used the machine to try to cut a wire.) Earlier this month, sheriff’s deputies from Los Angeles used a robot to disarm a violent suspect who had barricaded himself inside a berm in a Southern California desert. And last Friday, another robot was used to force doors open as police searched for a gunman hiding out in an Amtrak train. But perhaps the most ground-breaking—and potentially unnerving—case of robot-enabled policing took place in July when officers in Dallas used a robot to subdue a gunman, and ended up killing him. The man, later identified as Micah X. Johnson, had shot and killed police officers at a protest in the city’s downtown. His rampage left five officers dead and at least nine other people injured. The suspect fled into a local community college (not a parking structure, as had initially been reported) where he barricaded himself in an alcove at the end of a corridor. The police on his tail couldn’t approach because Johnson was still firing at them periodically, and there was nowhere to take cover in the corridor. During the standoff, Johnson told the officers he wanted to kill more people, and he said he had planted bombs in the area. With about 58 students and college staff still locked down inside the building—including eight people sheltering in a room on the floor below the shooter—the officers decided they could not wait Johnson out. Instead, they placed plastic explosives on a robot and sent it down the corridor. When it got to the alcove, they detonated the explosives, ultimately killing Johnson. Story Continued Below The news that the Dallas police department had killed a suspect using a robot shocked the country. It struck many as ruthless and excessive, if not downright illegal. To many, the killing seemed like an extra-judicial execution. It has provoked new fears at a time when police across the United States are being accused of excessive use of force, especially against blacks, including recent incidents just this past week in Tulsa, Okla, and Charlotte, N.C. For some critics, the idea of using bomb-enabled police robots to kill suspects could make matters only worse, calling to mind images of Terminators run amok or military drones taking out wedding parties. It has also reignited debates about “militarized policing.” “When things get easy, they tend to get overused,” said Jay Stanley, an American Civil Liberties Union policy analyst who studies the civil-liberties implications of new technologies. He is concerned that the Dallas incident—which experts say is the first known case of police using a robot to deploy lethal force—could be the beginning of a slippery slope. “The kind of incident where there is a clear and present danger represents the tip of a very large pyramid,” he said. There is evidence the Dallas police resorted to plastic explosives only because there were no other viable options. Thor Eells, chairman of the National Tactical Officers Association, told POLITICO that the Dallas police were hoping to take Johnson alive, going so far as bringing a trauma surgeon to the scene to begin treating Johnson if he survived the blast. The plastic explosives were necessary, experts say, because the officers needed to make sure Johnson would be incapacitated immediately (and thus unable to trigger his bombs). Both tear gas and pepper spray, as painful as they are, would have left him functional, and a “flash-bang” grenade ran the risk of detonating any bombs Johnson might have on him. Still, Dallas’ robot-enabled killing raises a host of questions that the wider society is still grappling with. “Does this remain something that is only used in extraordinary circumstances?” asked Stanley. “Or do police departments start clamoring for robots specifically designed to use force?” Stanley believes armed robots could make police officers quicker to pull a trigger, an unnerving prospect at a time when civil liberties activists say too many police are still too quick to do that already. “Let’s say there’s a protest, and there aren’t any police on the scene,” he said, “and a robot starts spraying pepper spray, or tear gas, or rubber bullets, on the crowd, and they do it with poor situational awareness”—the cameras on robots don’t provide the same visual acuity to their operators that a human on scene would have organically—“and they hit people who are not involved, or they do it when it’s not necessary.” SWAT experts push back against such fears. They point to existing laws that currently govern the situations in which law enforcement agencies may use force. “I am still legally responsible for having to explain and justify [any] level of force,” said Eells. “The mechanism of how the force is delivered is irrelevant to the courts.” And unlike firearms, which are distributed to all officers, only specialized SWAT teams own the large, expensive robots capable of killing a person. “You’re not going to see a plethora of these things in the future,” said Sid Heal, president of the California Association of Tactical Officers who, while serving in the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department, was a national leader in assessing and pioneering new technologies. Stanley counters, however, that every new technology introduces gray areas in which new kinds of abuse can seep in. He points to Tasers. Laws concerning use of force govern Tasers the same way they govern robots or pistols. “As it happens, [Tasers] are vastly overused,” Stanley said. “They’re often used to get recalcitrant suspects to cooperate with the police [or] as a punishment for dissing a cop.” Plus, though they were promoted as “less-than-lethal” alternatives to guns, they have nevertheless killed people. “Often, the way new technologies play out on the ground is not the way you would expect,” Stanley said. All of this raises questions about whether new laws are needed to govern robots and drones. Some states, including Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin, have outright banned law enforcement agencies from arming drones. Only North Dakota, so far, has explicitly permitted police to put weapons on drones, though only with less-than-lethal munitions, such as tear gas, bean bags and Tasers. In states with no such laws, police departments simply operate as they see fit, within the context of existing law. Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington who’s a leading expert on the intersection of robots and law, said making law enforcement agencies draft policies about how and when they can use robots and drones forces them to think through scenarios in advance. “If you want to put a Taser on a drone and tase a mentally ill person,” Calo said, “or if you want to follow someone around with a drone, that’s where you need to have a process in place that you’ve properly vetted with the leadership.” *** Robots are not new to policing. Most people are familiar with the bomb-squad versions, which have been in use for about 20 years. The large machines are maneuvered by remote control to inspect suspicious objects, and sometimes detonate them, while keeping humans out of harm’s way. What’s less well known is that SWAT teams are also increasingly using robots. The most common application is reconnaissance. In the middle of a standoff, where a suspect is barricaded in a room or a building, SWAT officers can toss small, camera-bearing devices, nicknamed “throwbots,” into a building to assess the situation. Robots can be used to deliver phones to people police are negotiating with. They can be used to search a parking lot for a suspect hiding under a car—instead of having an officer lower their head and risk getting it blown off. Robots have been used in more creative situations as well. In one case, a SWAT team used a robot to reach through a window and pull a blanket off of a suicidal person to check whether he had a weapon. (He didn’t.) In other cases, robots have swept homes for booby traps, and they’re often used to toss tear gas or pepper spray into rooms, to disable suspects before officers enter. In the California desert earlier this month, sheriff’s deputies used a robot to creep up behind the suspect and take away his rifle while he was distracted by helicopters and police officers yelling at him through loudspeakers. Police argue that these kinds of robots actually help save lives. Officers who are executing a search warrant in a volatile situation can send a robot in first. Send in an armed human, and the situation could quickly escalate into a shooting match. Send in a robot, and police can get a lay of the land and even start communicating with a suspect before putting an officer into the mix. Using a robot to approach the suspect in the desert earlier this month kept everyone safe, said Capt. Jack Ewell, head of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department’s Special Enforcement Division. As soon as the suspect realized his weapon was gone, he surrendered. “It prevented a potential shooting in which he could have been harmed, we could have been harmed, or a stray bullet could have been gone somewhere,” Ewell said. But using a robot to kill? That’s something new. The SWAT experts POLITICO spoke with said they didn’t know of a previous situation where a police department had used a robot to deploy lethal force. But they added it’s not likely we’ll suddenly see police departments regularly using robots this way. For one thing, robots like the one in Dallas are expensive. Most SWAT teams can’t afford them. The machines are large and unwieldy, weighing 400 to 800 pounds. Police departments need trailers just to move them about. They aren’t particularly mobile. While they can roll down a simple corridor or street, they can’t maneuver through a building as quickly a human can. (The robot used in Dallas, a Remotec Andros Mark V-A1, weighs nearly 800 pounds, and it can go only 3.5 mph.) And while robots can be outfitted with a firearm, the robot is never going to have the same agility in handling a dynamic situation as a well-trained SWAT officer. We also won’t soon be seeing autonomous machines—Terminator-style “killer robots” that act on their own. Even the military doesn’t give its robots independent shooting power. Military drones do perform certain actions on their own—like flying to a specific location or circling a target. But when it comes to pulling a trigger, the military still insists on keeping a “man in the loop.” Police departments are no different. “We recognize the grave responsibility we have with making the decision to use force,” said NTOA’s Eells, who is also commander of the Colorado Springs SWAT team. “There’s a tremendous reluctance to give that up.” As for the controversial kinds of drone killings that the U.S. has committed overseas, the laws governing the military use of force abroad are different from those that govern law enforcement agencies at home. “Domestic law is based on the Constitution,” Heal said. “Everything we do has to be traced back to that rock.” *** As much as anything, the public’s reaction to the Dallas robot underlines the gulf between police departments and the public in their understandings of the new devices. In a news conference immediately following the standoff, police Chief David Brown said the department had used a “bomb robot.” The shorthand was clear to him; he meant the department had used a robot belonging to the bomb squad. But many in the public understood those words differently: that there was a robot designed to be a bomb. This, as much as anything, might be what many found so upsetting. And while it was clear to law enforcement officers across the country that the Dallas SWAT team’s primary goal was to subdue Johnson—not kill him—the lack of detail released by Dallas police about the challenges it faced in apprehending Johnson, especially in an age when so many people are already up in arms about police killings of black men, left many in the public with the impression that the police simply sought to execute him. Even those who study this subject were left confused about the police’s objectives. “I was surprised that they did purposely kill someone with a robot,” said one expert. Police departments naturally view new technologies just as additional tools that don’t fundamentally change the parameters in which they operate. The public, however, often sees new devices as potentially threatening. Take Seattle, for example. Several years ago, the city’s police department bought two Draganflyer X6 drones—essentially hand-held mini-copters—as reconnaissance tools for use during hostage standoffs and search-and-rescue operations. Seattle residents, however, immediately became alarmed about the ways the devices could threaten personal privacy, and they rose up against them. The backlash might have surprised the Seattle police, knowing as they did that any surveillance inside a private space would require the same kind of warrant as an inspection done in person. In the face of the outcry, however, the city’s mayor shut the program down. (The copters were gifted to the LA police.) The implications, according to UW’s Calo, are potentially unfortunate. “Now, if a kid gets lost in a park,” he said, “the Seattle police department can’t roll out their drone to find them.” In a 2012, Lt. Anthony Martinez of the Fresno police department wrote a thesis for California’s Law Enforcement Command College that pinpointed this very problem. The paper examined how new types of robots could potentially save police lives by removing humans from scenarios in which robots could perform equally well. Martinez surveyed representatives from law enforcement and civic groups about what they saw as the potential challenges. Costs and legal questions certainly came up, but the top concern was society’s acceptance. Take the example of a robot performing an initial house search. “From a law enforcement perspective, it seems like a no-brainer,” Martinez said, because you’re reducing the chance an officer will get hurt. “But if you flip that around, people might not be ready to have a robot come into their house and tell them what to do.” In order to get the public to accept the use of robots, Martinez wrote in his paper, police departments first need to get the public familiar with them. That makes the Dallas operation a potential game-changer. Now that the public has seen a robot deploy force, previous institutional reluctance to use the devices this way might start to break down. “Public perception is an important part of this,” Heal said. Commanders who before might have been reluctant to authorize the use of force by a robot, he said, “now see that their careers are survivable.” The fact that we might see novel uses of robots in critical situations is why the ACLU’s Jay Stanley thinks there needs to be more discussion of what communities are willing to accept, especially in today’s incendiary environment. “This has started a whole new conversation,” he said. “It’s worth pausing to think about what it means for us as a society.”",1,0,0
322,"Washington (CNN)With two months to go before Election Day, Democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the White House, but Republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the Senate. Presidential campaigns and their supportive super PACs filed new numbers Tuesday that continue to show Clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. Clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of August; Trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. Meanwhile, a cadre of Republican donors -- most prominently, Sheldon Adelson -- are keeping Republicans competitive in down-ballot races. Here are the five takeaways from the money race: Hillary Clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires Under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few Democratic billionaires who are responsible for Clinton's advertising machine: Priorities USA. The super PAC had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. The bulk of the money is from a select few: Fred Eychaner and Daniel Abraham, who gave $3 million each, George Soros, who donated $2.5 million, Don Sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and Laurene Powell Jobs, whose LLC contributed another $2 million. Those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that Priorities USA has raised, and their names have littered Democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. Trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super PACs have failed to keep pace. Only one new name appeared on Trump's PAC's reports: Cherna Moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close Trump allies (and billionaires) Bob and Rebekah Mercer. What's Clinton's money good for? Ads Clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over Trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that Trump could not. The Democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in ""media buys."" That's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. And her campaign, joint fundraising committees and Priorities USA had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. She's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. Trump is finally raising the big bucks Despite record spending in the month of August -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- Trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. Trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the Republican National Committee. Trump finally began advertising in the month of August, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. He spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. The return of Mike Bloomberg The former New York City mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. His super PAC, Independence USA, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. But he personally is backing the Democratic ticket for president. The billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. That's his largest check ever to the super PAC. Senate Republicans have the upper hand Thanks to $21.5 million from the Adelsons, groups backing Senate Republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing Senate Democrats. The Senate Leadership Fund, an allied group in New Hampshire, and the Koch brothers' super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, raised $32.5 million in August. That also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the US Chamber of Commerce or other Koch nonprofit groups. And the Democrats? The main Senate groups -- Senate Majority PAC, Emily's List and the League of Conservation Voters -- took in only $20.5 million. Environmental activist Tom Steyer on Tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the Democratic ticket. But here's what we do know now: The Democrats don't have an Adelson equivalent. Their main Senate donor last month is Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. In the Senate cash race, Adelson is a game-changer. ",1,0,0
1003,"Truth be told, it isn’t really about Hillary anymore. Her picture comes on the screen, and you are very tempted to channel surf away from it. Story Continued Below But The Donald comes on, that orange pumpkin face fills the screen, and you stop to listen to what new outrage gushes forth from his lips. It does not matter if what he says is false. That Trump lies on a regular and dismal basis is no longer a question. It is a fact. For months and months, the national press corps has been tiptoeing around this. But now it has stopped clutching its pearls and has decided to call the truth the truth and a falsehood a falsehood. “Trump Gives Up a Lie, But Refuses to Repent,” was the front-page headline on Michael Barbaro’s tough-as-nails piece in The New York Times on Friday. The article, labeled a news analysis, was about “birtherism,” the racist lie that sought to discredit Barack Obama by saying he could not have been born in the United States because no African-American could honestly ascend to such a job. “It was never true, any of it,” Barbaro wrote. “Mr. Obama’s citizenship was never in question. No credible evidence ever suggested otherwise. “Yet it took Mr. Trump five years of dodging, winking and joking to surrender to reality, finally, on Friday, after a remarkable campaign of relentless deception that tried to undermine the legitimacy of the nation’s first black president.” “He nurtured the conspiracy like a poisonous flower, watering and feeding it with an ardor that still baffles and embarrasses many around him.” But not everybody around Trump is embarrassed. And his staff is paid to be baffled on a full-time basis. “We own both the momentum and enthusiasm dynamics right now,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said a few days ago, in the Trump version of English. “Everybody loves a winner, so people now see these polls tightening where we’re up, tied or within the margin of error in nearly all of the swing states,” Conway said. “People are starting to see that Trump can actually pull this off.” That’s right. Trump is exposed as a liar and this gives him the “enthusiasm dynamics” to pull off a victory, because lies make the polls tighten and tight polls make everybody love a winner even if he lied to get his victory. Poisonous flowers grow in such word salads, I guess. What was Conway really saying? A translation was provided in a Washington Post story on Sunday: “After five years of peddling lies and innuendo about the circumstances of President Obama’s birth, Trump on Friday bowed to the facts and acknowledged for the first time that Obama was born in the United States, although he refused to apologize for his efforts to delegitimize the nation’s first black president.” There it was in a news story by Philip Rucker and Dan Balz: A major party candidate had peddled lies for five years, had finally been forced to admit the truth, but was refusing to take any responsibility for his lies and their outcome. “Everybody loves a winner,” Conway said. On Friday, Trump said he was going to make a “major statement” about the whole birther mess. And he was going to make this statement from his lavish, which is to say tasteless, new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House. The press usually goes along with Trump’s buffoonery, giving him virtually unlimited airtime, Internet coverage and newspaper space regardless of what he has to say. This time, however, he went a little far. He managed to squeeze a lie into the nothing he had to say. “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it, you know what I mean,” Trump said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.” With that, Trump left the stage, taking no questions and making no apologies. Two days later, John Dickerson had Conway on “Face the Nation.” Dickerson: Donald Trump advocated something for five years that was a lie. Why did he do that? Conway: Well, you’re going to have to ask him, but again, I think this is a sideshow now. Dickerson said our next president might have to send young Americans off “to die in wars” and, therefore, it might be important whether the president was a truth teller or a liar. Conway reacted as if Dickerson was speaking Martian and said the press really ought to be concentrating on Trump’s new child care plan. (Though she did not say if Trump was telling the truth about his new child care plan.) On Saturday, President Obama addressed the annual Congressional Black Caucus Foundation dinner. “Now, there’s an extra spring in my step,” he said with a broad smile. “I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the birther thing is over.” “I mean, [ISIS], North Korea, poverty, climate change — none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate!” he said as the audience laughed. Truth and falsity are important, but so is balance. Having just quoted a Democrat, I’ll end with the words of a Republican, Abraham Lincoln: “No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar.” Which may be why Trump will fail in the end: He simply won’t be able to keep track of all his lies.

154,"Police protected and served the hell out of a teen girl in Hagerstown, Md. in a chilling incident that took place on Sunday. The 15-year-old biracial girl was riding her bike when she was hit by a car. She laid unconscious on the pavement for about 30 seconds and when she came to, she checked herself for injuries and decided to ride her bike home. Witnesses urged her to wait for the ambulance and police to show up, but the girl said she was fine and wanted to leave the scene. That’s when the police showed up and the situation went from bad to worse. In a Facebook video posted online, an onlooker caught the police manhandling the girl, slamming her into a wall, handcuffing her, shoving her into the back of a police car then pepper-spraying her in the face. For being hit by a car and trying to leave the girl was slapped with disorderly conduct, two counts of second-degree assault, possession of marijuana and failure to obey a traffic device. An attorney for the girl named Robin Ficker recounted the incident: She was dazed, then she got up and realized she was OK.” Ficker says when paramedics arrived the girl refused medical assistance and when she tried to ride away on her bike, police pulled the 5 foot 105 lbs girl off her bike. At this point, Ficker says the police lifted both her arms above her head and slammed her face first into a wall, adding: Her face hit the windowsill.” Ficker said at this point his client became terrified and struggled with police as they shoved her into the back of a police car. She refused to pull her feet into the car. That’s when the video begins. The cop warns her to pull her feet in or she’ll get pepper sprayed. In the video, the girl begs the white officers to call “Zack” who was a black officer she was apparently familiar with. A bystander then intervenes and questions the police over why they are treating the girl so roughly, the officer responds: “What happens…when she’s like, ‘I’m fine,’ right, and has a brain injury or something like that, and then she could die later? And she’s going to come over here and fight us when all we want to do is make sure she’s OK.” At this point, the police close the door on the girl’s feet and through a cracked window gas the backseat with pepper spray while the girl screams that she can’t breathe. Despite the police’s insistence, the girl had to be evaluated by a hospital for her injuries, rather than take her to the ER or turn her over to the paramedics, they take her straight to the police station and booked her on multiple charges. It took three hours for the girl to be released from jail, where her father drove her straight to the hospital to get the burning chemicals flushed from her eyes. Ficker says: The only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and Mace.” The girl is an honor student and never had a run-in with the law until Sunday. The Hagerstown police say they are reviewing body cam footage of the incident, but found the girl to be at fault for the bicycle accident. Featured Image via Facebook (Screen Capture)",0,1,0
455,"Washington (CNN)A series of high-profile breaches and warnings from national intelligence leaders has elections directors in critical battleground states seeking federal help against possible cyberattacks. Officials in Pennsylvania and Ohio tell CNN they are working closely with the Department of Homeland Security to protect their elections systems from cyberattacks and breaches. Ohio is going one step further. ""We even asked the National Guard to attempt to penetrate our databases,"" said Joshua Eck, a spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. ""We've had a number of really positive tests. It has gone well and we've been able to find vulnerabilities and fix them."" A pair of cyberattacks on Illinois' and Arizona's voter registration databases over the summer spurred the Obama administration to ring the alarm bells for states as they prepare for what has already been a chaotic campaign. And top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees publicly accused the Russian government of seeking to alter the election. ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, said Thursday. Russian intelligence agencies behind US election hacks, lawmakers say Cybersecurity experts say the prospect of ""rigging"" the election, and changing the outcome, is practically impossible. Elections are decentralized: 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, run their own operations, not to mention the thousands of counties across the country that play a major role at the local level. Different jurisdictions use different voting machines, It isn't plausible for hackers to breach them all in one fell swoop -- penetrating one election system in North Carolina has no impact on Colorado. Furthermore, most voting machines aren't connected to the Internet, which inoculates them from outside intrusions. But hackers could still cause plenty of havoc in November, with attacks on registration systems or government websites reporting the results on election night. Many news organizations pull their results from those sites. ""Think about the chaos you could cause if you get one TV network calling the election for one candidate, and another network calling the election for the other,"" said Professor Herbert Lin, a cybersecurity expert at Stanford University. ""If your intent is to sow doubt and uncertainty, at least in the short term, affecting the media reporting could be really problematic."" DHS running 'Cyber hygiene scans' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is the Obama administration's point man on election security, holding meetings with elections officials from across the country, and offering help to states that are interested. DHS is offering ""cyber hygiene scans"" that will remotely search for vulnerabilities in election systems like online voter registration systems and election night reporting infrastructure. It is also offering to send cybersecurity experts to states so they can conduct more aggressive in-person testing the final weeks of the campaign. Johnson recently laid out other federal resources for states in a memo last week, including a 24/7 center to respond to cyberattacks, and a list of ""best practices"" on how to secure voter registration databases. Pennsylvania has accepted the DHS help, both the remote scans and the in-person testing, said Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren. Election authorities in Ohio are also accepting federal help. But not every state is happy to have the administration involved. Georgia's secretary of state publicly scoffed at these efforts and accused the federal government of trying to ""subvert the Constitution."" Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican, rebuffed the idea, telling Nextgov that the feds might want to ""subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security."" However, his office later walked back the comment, saying they were not flatly refusing the assistance. A call for comment from Kemp was not immediately returned Thursday. Florida officials, whose recount debacle in 2000 led to the federal law which ultimately created voter registration databases, declined to say whether they were accepting help from DHS, citing security concerns. What are the threats? Perhaps the most serious vulnerability is the integrity of voter registration systems. Hackers can break in and delete or alter individual voter registration records, creating confusion on Election Day when voters show up to their polling place and their names are mysteriously missing from the rolls, or their address is changed. This summer, hackers broke into a stash of information for about 90,000 voters in Illinois, breaching a database with voters' names, addresses, sex and birthdays. And officials in Arizona took their voter registration system offline after they learned that a Russian hacker had breached their systems. Once hackers penetrate a voter registration system, ""the scope could be whatever they want,"" said Cathie Brown, who served as Virginia's deputy chief information security officer and is a cybersecurity expert with Impact Makers. ""Deleting an entire precinct of voters -- that's absolutely possible. The grander the scope, the more likely they'll get caught. But they might not get caught until after they've done the damage."" But at least one expert said that state elections directors have been dealing with technological threats for a long time. ""The state and local election officials, this whole notion of security is not new to them this is something they deal with all the time,"" said Tim Mattice, executive director of the Elections Center, which trains state and local elections officials on administering elections. Mattice's organization works with the professional group representing election officials, the National Association of State Election Directors. Mattice said that when DHS offered up help, most people understood them when they said they were making it voluntary and did not want to be viewed as coming in and taking over state-run elections. Ironically, Mattice noted that the focus on technological security got serious after Congress passed the national Help America Vote Act in the wake of the 2000 elections, which mandated that states develop integrated voter registration systems -- effectively placing all the voter data in systems that could be hacked. Asked how hackers got through in Illinois and Arizona despite the layers of security that elections officials already have in place, Mattice said it's the same problem any organization or business faces. ""You could ask Target how they got hacked -- these hackers are getting sophisticated,"" Mattice said. ",1,0,0
1386,"Both of the 2016 presidential candidates had their chance to speak out about the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. There are so many differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, just in these videos alone. Watch!  What a difference in Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s responses to last night’s NYC bombing. Trump said, “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” Trump said during a rally last night at an airport hangar in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “But boy we are living in a time — we better get very tough, folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” These comments came just minutes after the explosion occurred.  Hillary by contrast, looked like she was half asleep (or even drugged) during her response, in which she contradicted herself within a period of forty seconds. At the 0:28 mark in the video below, she states ““I’ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as the attack in Minnesota.” Then, at 1:08, she was asked ““Do you have any reaction to the fact that Donald Trump, prior to taking the stage tonight, called the explosion tonight a bomb, and if that’s an appropriate term”?” Hillary, apparently unaware that bombings are caused by bombs, replied “Well I think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this, that’s why it’s critical to support he first responders, the investigators, who are looking into it to determine what did happen.”  What could she possibly think was the cause of the explosion? A brain fart? The difference in the professionalism between these two is beyond me. Hillary Clinton is obviously proving herself to not be well enough to run a country. She just needs to drop out and rest.",0,0,1
504,"(CNN)Newt Gingrich thinks the current Clinton running for president is nothing like the last one. ""I worked with Bill Clinton,"" Gingrich tweeted Tuesday. ""Bill Clinton and I got a lot done -- welfare reform, balancing the budget. Hillary Clinton is no Bill Clinton."" Gingrich also took issue with how Hillary Clinton pointed to the economic success of 1990s during Monday's first presidential debate as an indicator for how her presidency would be. ""If Hillary Clinton is going to cite 1990s she needs to drop tax increasing, red tape increasing left wing policies. She is opposite of 90s,"" he tweeted. For Gingrich, a supporter of Donald Trump, it was praise for an old adversary -- done at the expense of Clinton's wife and the current Democratic presidential nominee. During his tenure as House speaker in the 1990s, Gingrich was frequently at odds with Bill Clinton during an acrimonious period of a divided Washington that included a government shut down. The tweet came the day after the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump, and it called to mind a famous quip from a previous debate. At the 1988 vice presidential debate, Democratic nominee Lloyd Bentsen fired off an indelible retort to the Republican Dan Quayle, who had invoked John F. Kennedy to defend his qualifications for the office. ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine,"" Bentsen said, while staring down Quayle. ""Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" ",1,0,0
155,"Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended âstop and frisk,â but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From : In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address âviolence in the black communityâ and âblack-on-black crime.â Trump responded by proposing that âstop-and-friskâ policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. âI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,â Trump told the questioner. Stop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management. When the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadnât done anything wrong. Former US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as âdestructiveâ in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added: âIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.â ",0,1,0
1627,"In a powerful statement, a University of Nebraska football player opened up about the racism he experienced in response to kneeling during the national anthem. Before their game with Northwestern this past Saturday, Nebraska Cornhuskers players Michael Rose-Ivey, DaiShon Neal, and Mohamed Berry all took a knee during the national anthem in a silent protest of police brutality, as NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other athletes across the country have done. In a press conference with local media on Monday, Rose-Ivey detailed the horrific racism he experienced as a result of his protest. “I am still referred to on Facebook and Twitter as a ‘clueless, confused nigger’ by former high school classmates, peers, and even [Nebraska] Husker fans. Some believe DaiShon, Mohamed, and myself should be kicked off the team or suspended, while some say we deserve to be lynched or shot just like other black people who have died recently,” Rose-Ivey said. “Another believe that since we didn’t want to stand for the anthem, that we should be hung before the anthem before the next game,” he added, after a long pause. However, Rose-Ivey said he felt obligated to take a knee, saying he was using his platform on the roster of one of the nation’s most prestigious college football programs to bring awareness to the injustice suffered by black Americans on a daily basis. “While you may disagree with the method, these reactions underscore the need for these protests and gives us just a small glimpse into the problem of racism in this country and the divisive mentality of some Americans,” Rose-Ivey said. “As Dr.King said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. the hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict. An individual who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” Mohamed Barry told the Omaha World-Herald that while the players experienced racism, the overwhelming majority of responses were positive. “Our fans, they agree with it, they see the injustice, and for the most part they support us,” Barry said. However, if Rose-Ivey’s passionate statement is any indicator, the silent protest during the national anthem won’t stop anytime soon. “There are issues in this country that need to be addressed. There are issues in this country that can no longer be pushed off onto the backs of another generation.” Watch the full video of Michael Rose-Ivey’s statement below:             ",0,1,0
587,"A Donald Trump supporter in Bellingham, Washington delivered a shocking rebuke to an obvious Hillary Clinton fan that may have jolted some sense into her – literally. When local police failed to respond to Ray Gilbride’s complaints that someone was removing “Trump” signs from his front yard, he decided to take matters into his own hands – and not merely because the culprit was interfering with his constitutional right to express his political opinion. “The fact is, stealing is stealing. I’m getting a lot of that criticism, too, people saying it’s just a sign. Why do we prosecute kids for stealing just a candy bar? Situational ethics is wrong. Stealing is stealing. You’ve got to go back to the basics. If it’s not yours don’t touch it.” And it wasn’t just theft – whoever was removing the “Trump” signs was trespassing on Gilbride’s property. So, after talking to police about his legal options to protect his property – the front yard and the signs – Gilbride rigged up a trip-wire and hooked it up to a non-lethal electric charge that would deliver a surprise to the Clinton-supporting thief the next time she made a late night raid. “It would have been different if somebody hooked it to a 110 (volt) outlet and watched somebody get hurt,” said Gilbride, adding that a pulsating charge similar to that used in invisible pet fences doesn’t do any lasting damage.  Sure enough, the surveillance camera caught the image of the unsuspecting woman running onto Gilbride’s yard in the middle of the night, making her way to the now-electrified “Trump” sign. “She just stopped, just a dead stop,” Gilbride told local news reporters. The woman, who remains unidentified, eventually regained her senses, according to the laughing homeowner, and was able to make off with the signs, anyway. Presumably she wouldn’t be quite as in favor of this form of supporting a candidate if it was Gilbride sneaking onto her yard in the middle of the night to steal “I’m With Her” signs. Funny how that works for some liberals. ",0,0,1
635,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory. The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech). This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures. Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?). The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.” The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life. Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17). Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge. Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them. Who’s the racist? I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be. It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.” Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory. Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee. When they visit her in prison.

1579,"Liberals are not known for their rationality and logic. The entire liberal movement revolves around emotion and assuaging their poor, hurt feelings while telling people whatever they want to hear. On top of that, they’re hyper-sensitive, shrieking in outrage and demanding safe spaces whenever they’re confronted with anything that doesn’t fit into their narrow liberal worldview. One liberal learned the hard way that the rest of the world doesn’t always play along.   Some crazy liberal girl was driving along to pick up her son from school when she was confronted with the worst thing she could possibly come across: a homeowner with Trump signs on his lawn. She said that she drives past his house occasionally and it makes her absolutely enraged, having to see a private citizen expressing his own First Amendment rights. So when she saw him in his driveway, she flipped him off and then called the police when he started following her. Unfortunately, things didn’t quite go as planned.   The “mother f***er”, as she described him, got in his car and photographed her car and license plate. So. she reacted exactly as expected, with maturity and wisdom. Ha! Not exactly. Instead, she yelled, “Back off, you f***ing racist!” and began honking her horn and flashing her lights at him. This drew the attention of a police officer, who informed her that she was now a public disturbance, as she was carrying on like a lunatic in a school zone. She explained to the officer that she was recording him, for all of her social media “followers” and told the officer that she flipped off the man for having Trump signs displayed. “My question is, why would you even go out of your way to do that?” the officer, very reasonably, asked. Her answer? Because she’s angry about the election, which evidently gives her the right to do whatever the heck she wants. The officer, however, told her that she was letting her emotions get the best of her and to just move on. And then she really lost it. “Move on? There is a racist, xenophobic maniac running for president and that guy is supporting him and if I give him the finger, that’s a peaceful… ” she ranted. “My point is that I silently protested something I don’t agree with.” So she can give someone the finger because she has First Amendment rights, but this man — who she disagrees with — evidently should not be allowed to express his own opinions and beliefs, all because she doesn’t like them. And Miss Crazy Pants learned the hard way that she can’t do whatever she wants without consequences. “What you need to do is stay away from him,” he said. “Don’t drive by his residence.” She responded that she has to drive by his house, so the officer warned her that he has cameras outside recording her actions. “I would recommend that you just drive on next time,” he said. “Don’t start fights.” Ouch.

1537,"A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?   Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.” Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.” The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.” Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him: Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan. The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left? ",0,0,1

510,"Washington (CNN)House Speaker Paul Ryan dodged Tuesday when asked about Donald Trump's criticism of a former Miss Universe, trying instead to put the focus on Hillary Clinton following the first presidential debate. Trump on Fox News Tuesday defended making critical remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's weight gain back in the 1990s. The Republican nominee said she had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem."" Ryan, who has been critical of Trump's comments in the past, did not bite on this one, however. ""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it,"" Ryan said. ""I think this debate, I think people, met their expectations, and I think Hillary gave a very polished, well-rehearsed status quo defense and I think Donald Trump gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo,"" Ryan added.

Charlie Dent, one of a handful of remaining moderate Republicans, was critical of Trump's bragging about not paying taxes. But Rep. Tom Cole, a close ally of Ryan's, said Trump merely needed to clear the bar for looking presidential. ""I think actually Trump had a pretty good night,"" Cole said.

I mean, if you tell them and you know that someone in your family is engaged in terrorist activity and it coincides with the rise of ISIS and they do nothing, what are we paying them to do exactly? I hope they feel terrible about themselves and what’s more, I hope they are ordered to pay the medical bills of the victims, as well as the pain and suffering and lost wages. What is the point of the government telling us “see something, say something” if when we see something and say something, nothing comes of it until the attempted murder of American citizens?  Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man who is being accused of creating and/or detonating hidden IEDs in New York/New Jersey, was captured by police. Afterward, it was revealed that his own father had reported him to the Federal Bureau of Investigations in 2014 for “being a terrorist” according to The New York Times. Two years before Ahmad Khan Rahami went on a bombing rampage in New York and New Jersey, his father told the police that the son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two senior law enforcement officials. The father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to New Jersey police in 2014, when Mr. Rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother. The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted. It is thought that the father only made the comment out of anger at his son, but it was very clear that he knew something he didn’t actually want the FBI to investigate. Is the father also accountable for his son’s actions for recanting a statement that was clearly true and putting decent, hardworking Americans at risk? Or is this just on his son, who was the actual creator and distributor of the explosive devices? In my opinion, there’s enough blame to go around. Obviously, the actual terrorist himself receives the bulk of it, but I also would like to point my finger at the father who (it would seem) hid what he knew about his son’s activities and the FBI who didn’t continue the investigation.

It is a financial maneuver the real estate mogul said he has performed many times throughout his career. Story Continued Below “It’s called OPM. I do that all the time in business.

The gun rights group said it’s spending $5 million to run the spot on national cable and on regional stations in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia. The ad does not mention Donald Trump, who the group endorsed in May. But it does dovetail with messages that both he and the NRA have delivered before, casting Clinton as an elitist who would take away individuals’ guns while benefiting from armed protection herself. Story Continued Below The ad, called “Nightstand,” shows a woman, alone in bed, awakened in the night by an intruder. She dashes for a landline phone, and a gun stored in a safe. But it fades away before she can grab it. A narrator says the average 911 response time is 11 minutes. “Hillary Clinton would take away her right to self defense, and with Supreme Court justices, Hillary can,” the narrator says. “Don’t let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone.” Self defense against other people has become the top reason for gun ownership in the United States, according to a new study from Harvard and Northeastern University researchers. About two-thirds listed that reason for owning guns in 2015, The Trace reported, and handgun ownership has risen proportionally compared with rifles. That’s despite drops in violent crime over recent decades. While Clinton has made tighter gun laws, including universal background checks, a centerpiece of her campaign, she has not said she wants to ban firearms or repeal the Second Amendment. However, the NRA points to comments she made at a fundraiser that the Supreme Court is “wrong on the Second Amendment,” an apparent reference to a 2008 case that affirmed an individual’s right to bear arms. With its latest buy, the NRA has spent more than $11 million to support Trump’s candidacy, adding to its status as the biggest outside spender. The group’s previous spot highlighted that Clinton has armed protection, even as she would restrict it for others. Trump recently seized on this line of argument as well, in a way that some interpreted as inciting violence. Speaking Friday in Miami, Trump called for her “bodyguards” — the U.S. Secret Service — to disarm. “Take their guns away. She doesn’t want guns … let’s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, OK? It’d be very dangerous,” Trump said. That followed an ad-lib in August when he said “Second Amendment people” could stop her from nominating Supreme Court justices if she wins the election.",1,0,0
11,"Rose Pak, a brash and lively community activist who helped transform San Francisco's growing Asian American population into a politically powerful constituency during an era when few women carried such clout, has died. She was 68. Pak died of natural causes in her home Sunday morning. Friends and family said she seemed healthy after spending several months in China after a kidney transplant, The San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday (http://bit.ly/2d22ERE). Pak never held elective office, but as the longtime consultant to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, she helped raise money for preferred politicians and backed projects that benefited Chinatown's residents. She hated being called a power broker. ""If I was white, they'd call me a civic leader."" In 2011, Pak started a campaign that led to Ed Lee becoming the city's first Chinese American mayor. She would later call him an enormous disappointment. ""She was strong and fearless,"" Lee told The Chronicle. ""Whether she was right or wrong, she grounded herself in representing the community. She really wanted to make sure Chinatown as a whole was respected."" Pak was born in Hunan, China, and fled to Hong Kong with her family as a child. She arrived in San Francisco in 1967, became a reporter for The Chronicle and covered the community she would later champion. She was such an aggressive reporter that a lawyer ended up in court on battery charges after throwing a punch at Park during an interview. The lawyer called her ""an enormously pushy person."" Pak countered that she ""was trained to be persistent."" Pak became an advocate as she became immersed in issues concerning the neighborhood. In the 1970s, she helped save Chinatown's Chinese Hospital, an underfunded medical center for Cantonese-speaking poor. A few years ago, she took over efforts to raise more than $100 million to rebuild the facility. ""I don't know if I'm the best person, but someone had to do it,"" she said, according to the newspaper. Pak was such an institution that 300 people, including Lt. Gov. and former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, were on hand in May at San Francisco's airport to greet her when she returned from China. She told the crowd that her doctor said she could live another 40 years. Pak said she only needed 15, including 10 to rebuild a housing complex in Chinatown and five ""to get even with the people who wished me dead.""",1,0,0
203,"Donald Trump’s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston. Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn’t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is – adding another layer of deceit and fraud to Trump’s already horrendous track record. The clip was published by , where Johnston goes through Trump’s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul’s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher, “even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.” The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: “The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up.” Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut “feelings” and “emotional state” to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how “nuts” it was, and imitated Trump’s strategy: “By the way, I’m having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars.” Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump’s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump’s bankers said that the GOP nominee’s net worth was actually  $295 million. Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trump isn’t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is “no evidence that he is a billionaire.” You can watch Johnston call out Trump’s lies below:  ",0,1,0
1515,"As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are. Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.  From the Independent Review Journal: But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer.  The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:  People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not. I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.    ",0,0,1
1329,"Capitol Hill Republicans grumbled Tuesday about Donald Trump’s debate performance, but they also saw a silver lining: He didn’t overtly screw up their own election prospects — at least not yet. They didn’t need a lot from him: just don’t let the floor collapse on the Republican Party with an election-altering gaffe. So even after their nominee all but admitted paying no federal taxes and stood by his attacks on a woman for gaining too much weight, plenty of congressional Republicans were breathing a sigh of relief. And no one was predicting doomsday on Nov. 8. Story Continued Below “He made his points and he didn’t make any major mistakes. … so I think he had a very good night,” said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. “We’re to the point now that our presidential nominee is helping us, not hurting us, and that was an unknown several months ago. He’s performing above expectations and we’re benefiting from it in the House and will probably benefit from it in the Senate as well.” That’s a remarkable change in tone for the party that fretted for months about a down-ballot backlash against their nominee. Republicans worried Trump’s controversial comments would cripple their incumbents and wipe out their Senate and possibly even House majorities. But Trump’s improved performance this month has buoyed congressional Republicans, to the point that those fears have morphed into hopes of minimal House losses and keeping the Senate. And while his performance Monday was far from flawless — he was too easily goaded by Hillary Clinton instead of hammering at her vulnerabilities, several Republicans said — it could have been a lot worse. “I think it’s basically a wash,” said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who heads the Senate Republican campaign arm. “I think he did just fine.” House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been highly critical of Trump’s controversial comments in the past, also gave the nominee’s performance a robust endorsement. “I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference. “I think he passed a number of thresholds … and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton.” Other Republicans were less enthused. Republican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores of Texas said Trump “made some good points, but he wasn’t as consistent as he could be.” Another Texan, House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions, said Trump’s “abilities are greater” than he showed. And moderate Rep. Charlie Dent, a frequent Trump critic, said the nominee did not meet his goal of demonstrating that he could be presidential and substantive on the issues. “I think the reaction from a lot of people is: ‘In a nation of over 300 million people, this is the best we can do?’” the Pennsylvania Republican said. “I thought I was watching a dumpster fire.” Rep. Patrick Meehan, also of Pennsylvania, said Trump “had an idea where he wanted to go,” but didn’t quite get there: “He started out strong but needed to be able to stay disciplined, and I think the next debate you’ll probably see him more capable of doing that.” Even Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a Trump supporter, wouldn’t say Trump won. “From the lens of Trump supporters, they would believe he did well, and from the lens of a Clinton view, they would say she clearly won,” Zeldin said. “As for undecided voters, I don’t know. … Each side scored some points. Both sides as they watch the video afterwards may say, ‘Maybe I should have answered this question a little differently.’” Some Republicans, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), didn’t want to talk about the debate at all. Others claimed they didn’t watch it and therefore couldn’t weigh in. Those who did, however, said one of Trump’s weaker moments came when Clinton attacked him for calling a former beauty pageant contestant “Miss Piggy” when she later gained weight. Trump doubled down on those comments in an interview on Fox News. Asked about Trump’s pageant comments, Zeldin, without calling out Trump specifically, said his best advice “for anyone running for office is to focus on your policy, your vision.” Ryan wouldn’t comment on the pageant remarks. Democrats on the Hill, meanwhile, said Trump’s performance showed why he shouldn’t be president. House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said his answers proved it’d be “dangerous” for him to be “leader of the free world.” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra of California dodged a question about whether Trump’s behavior — interrupting and talking over Clinton multiple times — was sexist, but did say it was clear the GOP nominee became “unhinged” over the course of the 90-minute faceoff. “And I think that’s the last thing we want for a president who will have his or her finger over the nuclear button, someone who becomes unhinged so easily,” Becerra told reporters. “I think Donald Trump essentially showed who he is.” Overall, though, several Republicans didn’t feel Trump’s missteps were a big deal. “I think there were some missed opportunities, but let’s face it: For all the complaining about the Clinton camp, the bar was set low and all he had to do was prove he had a good temperament,” said Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. “I think he met that test, so I don’t now what all the complaining is about. … I’m not worried.” Republicans also noted that Trump showed again that he’s his own breed. During the debate, he railed against trade and backed Democrats’ pitch to revoke gun rights from people on the “no-fly” list, for example. This, some felt, created a buffer to separate the party from the wild, and at times unruly, candidate. Heather Caygle and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.",1,0,0
782,"Speculation about Hillary Clinton’s health continues to grow after her 9/11 fainting and overheating spell that forced her to leave a remembrance service early. She has released some medical records on Wednesday as rumors persisted. However, most people still don’t believe what she has to say. The released records have caused even more speculation and wonder especially over Clinton’s lack of transparency. Dr. Lisa Bardack released a letter that showed Clinton actually had surgery in January because of a severe sinus infection. But Clinton never revealed this to the public. Doctors put a drain in Clinton’s ear in order to clear the fluid that came as a result of her infection. Apparently it made her better. People have intimidated that she likely had a myringotomy. A CT scan in March showed that she had healed up well. Bardack wrote in her report, “This scan showed no abnormalities of the brain and mild chronic sinusitis. The symptoms resolved and she continued symptom-free for the next six months.” While a sinus infection certainly is nothing to serious the major problem people have is with her dishonesty. Why keep it a secret? Why be dishonest? Why lack transparency? Read the full transcript here.   Clinton’ campaign has a notable and widely publicized issue with transparency and honesty. She is well aware of the fact that many people think this about her and question the veracity of her healthy status. Thus, to be dishonest through a lie of omission seems simply stupid. Clinton is many things but stupid isn’t one of them. So why the lies? The public had a right to know about the health of the people running for the highest office in the land. It’s a perfectly reasonable line of questioning. To brush it off as a conspiracy theory is wrong, which Clinton has done. And it further shows people they have something to be concerned about.

153,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we donât vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced. It hasnât been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that weâve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was âPapaâ John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employeesâ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didnât. This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnât get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carlâs Jr. and Hardeeâs. Hereâs one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:  Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But thatâs not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesnât want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote: âI want to try it,â CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. âWe could have a restaurant thatâs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.â âWith government driving up the cost of labor, itâs driving down the number of jobs,â he says. âYouâre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.â âThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,â says Puzder. âDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?â Source: Yahoo Finance This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. Heâs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests. Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is. Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees donât see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied. You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. Thatâs just the way he is: profits over people.",0,1,0
1008,"Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies. “Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.” Story Continued Below Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks. The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe. “Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.” “They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”",1,0,0

292,"(CNN)Drawing enormous support from the state's non-white voters, Hillary Clinton holds a 5-point edge over Donald Trump in Florida, according to a new poll from Monmouth University out Tuesday. The poll found Clinton leading Trump among likely voters in the crucial battleground, 46%-41%. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, both of whom will be on Florida's ballot, drew 6% and 1%, respectively. Monmouth's poll produced another unfavorable finding for Trump: 54% of Florida voters believe the GOP nominee's recent turnabout on President Barack Obama's origins was made for political reasons. Only 24% think Trump believes that Obama is a natural-born citizen. After years of promoting conspiracy theories regarding the first black President's birthplace, Trump changed course last week. He still has plenty of work to do on that front in Florida. According to the poll, Clinton leads Trump among Hispanic, black and Asian voters in the state, 69%-16%. Those three blocs comprise one-third of Florida's electorate. Clinton's 5-point advantage is wider than other recent polls out of the state, including a CNN/ORC survey released last week that found Trump up by 3, within the poll's 3.5 percentage point margin of error. But it's smaller than her lead in the previous Monmouth poll in Florida last month, which showed Clinton up by 9. That margin was also larger than other Florida polls conducted at the time. The latest Monmouth poll was conducted September 16-19 using phone interviews with 400 likely Florida voters. It has a margin of error of 4.9%. ",1,0,0
736,"Donald Trump got off to a great start during Monday night’s debate, his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. But his performance wasn’t without bumps. So, did Trump appear like a legitimate candidate tonight? And did Hillary maintain her status as a policy wonk who knows her stuff ? Was she able to fend off claims that she is shrill? And what of the moderator? Was Lester Holt a moderator, or was he a third debater and on Hilary’s side, at that? This was a very historic debate, certainly. Hillary Clinton, the first female candidate from a major party, met Donald Trump, one of the first political neophytes and businessmen to gain the nomination of a major party, are engaged in an election that for many is about all the marbles. Many, both left and right, feel that if their candidate doesn’t win it will be a catastrophe for the nation. While Democrats feel that if Trump wins they may end up in the political wilderness for decades, Republicans are equally sure that if Hillary wins she will finish the destruction of the nation started by Barack Obama. What ever might happen in the months to come, this, the first of three debates, did not end Trump’s campaign. He held his own well enough against Hillary’s wonky demeanor, and was able to stand toe-to-toe with her for the entire 90-minute debate. He also didn’t commit any major gaffes and pulled the reins back on the sort of extreme combativeness we saw from him during his primary debates. But Trump missed a lot of opportunities and seemed on the defensive throughout. While he was still forceful and in places combative, Trump was able to successfully slam home one message. His main line of attack during the night was that Hillary has spent 30 years in government leading this nation with the polices she advocated tonight, yet this nation is failing and our world is more dangerous than ever. Donald Trump wondered aloud how all her wonderful plans would change anything that she hasn’t been able to change in her 20 years in power? In the end, though, Trump did not hurt himself in this debate, something that will surely discourage liberals supporting Hillary. It is doubtful that Trump lost any supporters even as he may not have picked up any new acolytes. As to Hillary, she didn’t get shrill and even once or twice seemed to respond like a real human might. She seemed in command of her ideas and generally kept an even tone. In the final analysis, though, this outing should likely be scored as something of a tie and in that case the challenger might be awarded a bit of a win. After all, this was Trump’s first one-on-one presidential debate against a candidate who has been in a dozen of them over two presidential campaigns yet he was able to keep he head about him and say mostly on track with only a few instances where he got bogged down. He’ll likely get even better at this over the next two outings. As to moderator Holt, it was clear he bowed to pressure from his pals on the left to become the third candidate on the stage. He constantly interrupted Trump and was clearly on Hillary’s side throughout the night. By contrast he almost never interrupted Hillary. The night started with moderator Lester Holt opening the debate with questions on the economy. Like a Democrat does, Hillary essentially answered to the question of how she would fix this nation’s faltering economy by unloading yet another laundry list of big government programs. In fact, her entire appeal seemed to be fully centered on Democrat tactics of the 1990s. Hillary insisted that her tax plan would help small businesses create jobs. And yet, she made this claim only days after releasing her confiscatory estate tax plan that critics say would make sure no family farm or small business could ever be passed down from parent to child because her tax rate is so high that families would have to sell those businesses and farms to pay her 65 percent taxes hit. This sort of uncertainty is not a builder of small business. It is a destroyer of them. When Holt turned to Trump, the GOP candidate went into his familiar “America doesn’t win any more” talking points and added that his tax cut plan would be the biggest since Ronald Reagan’s and would send the economy booming again. Incidentally, this is precisely what Hillary’s husband, Bill Clinton, did in the mid 1990s to reverse the economic disaster he set in motion with his own disastrous tax hike. When he first came to office, Bill bowed to the left of his party and raised taxes but after his party was wiped out in the 1994 midterm elections because the economy was sinking under his policies he abruptly changed direction, lowered taxes, and helped bring back national prosperity. This is a lesson Hillary obviously has not learned if her high tax policy is any indication. In any case, Trump hit over and over on his claim that we need to stop American jobs and businesses from fleeing the country and noted that Hillary’s policies are little different than Obama’s and that she would not be able to stop jobs from leaving America. Incidentally, the segment was another example of Lester Holt joining team Hillary as he insisted calling Trump’s tax plan “tax cuts for the wealthy” when in fact his plan would cut taxes for 60 percent of U.S. households. In response, Hillary threw out one of her catch phrases calling Trump’s policy “Trumped up trickle down,” in a tactic again reminiscent of tired old 1990s liberal talking points. The Democrat nominee also claimed that her massive tax hike would create 10 million jobs, a claim that is hard to fathom. Sadly Trump missed the opportunity to note that this is the same lie Obama used when he took office and his reputation as a jobs creator is dismal, indeed. Trump could have pointed out how Hillary’s nonsense is just like Obama’s and we have a sluggish economy with millions out of work as a result. Another tactic Hillary employed early and often throughout the debate was to urge the media to “fact check” Trump. This is just a continuation of her coordination with the same media that put out a slew of Trump hit pieces three days before the debate. Trump went on to hit Hillary on the NAFTA and TPP trade polices as he has been doing for months, now. What ever you feel about NAFTA, Hillary did not mount a very effective response to Trump’s accusation and indeed she used a false claim against Trump as she did so. Hillary insisted that Trump cheered the housing crisis when people were losing their homes late in the 2000s. Hillary has uttered this lie many times, but even CNN noted that the claim is not true. Trump did not celebrate people losing their homes. The issue of Trump’s tax returns next came up but Trump got the better of Hillary with the question and got the crowd to break its pledge of silence at the same time. When the partisan Holt asked Trump if he’ll release his tax returns, he replied, “I’ll release my tax returns when she releases her 33,000 emails that she deleted.” The crowd erupted in cheers but were then scolded by Holt for breaking the silence pledge. Hillary’s only real response was to Harry Reid-like claim that Trump doesn’t want to release his taxes because he has never paid any federal taxes at all. However her attack line on Trump has been proven incorrect even by the so-called “fact checkers” she kept trying to press into service to go after Trump. Fact check site Politifact has said Hillary’s claim that Trump paid no taxes is “mostly false.” Trump also made some great points when he noted that the U.S.A. is a “serious debtor nation” with an infrastructure that is falling apart and the nation needs a new leader who “has an idea about money.” Moderator Holt then moved onto the the racial divide and in her answer Hillary insisted that America’s police are racists who need re-education. In her opinion, our police are “implicitly biased” against blacks. Trump then reminded America that it was Hillary who said that blacks were “super predators,” a statement she later had to apologize for. But Trump hit a bad spot when asked to once again respond to his former birtherism. Trump rambled and was not able to successfully reply to the issue on stage. Hillary made herself look petty, though. when she called Trump’s birtherism a “racist lie.” Whatever you believe about where Obama was born, the issue has nothing to do with his race. It has to do with his citizenship. That wasn’t the end of Hillary’s name calling. She later directly called Trump a racist, as well, for his words against the importation of Muslim terrorists. Hillary also said Trump is anti-woman despite the fact that Trump employs more women in high positions than most big New York companies. The attacks gave Trump a good opening to reiterate that Hillary has spend hundreds of millions of campaign dollars on vicious attack ads on TV, yet despite the expenditure, the two candidates are virtually tied in the polls. The lie about Trump being a racist was far from the only lie Clinton told this night. Clinton also disgorged a series of other lies during the debate. In one case Hillary insisted that when she became Obama’s Secretary of State Iran was “weeks away” from having a nuclear bomb. But in truth there is no intelligence estimate from any country that supports her claim. Clinton also insisted she was against the Trans Pacific Trade agreement in its early stages. But in fact, Hillary called the TPP scheme the “gold standard” of trade agreements and was a major supporter of the plan. So, what did we end up with last night? As noted above, the night was more or less a tie. No one who supports either candidate would have been swayed to abandon their support. Neither came away with any knock out blows and both held their own. We move on to round two wondering if we may yet see something that might become a game changer. But the immediate post debate period was interesting in that it showed what sort of candidate Trump really is. As is usual for a presidential candidate after a debate, Hillary Clinton disappeared after waving to supporters. But Trump made himself available to the media right away. Trump’s talking to Sean Hannity and other members of the media as he exited the stage marks a first for a presidential candidate and it only goes to highlight the fact that Hillary went well over 200 days before speaking to the media while Trump has made himself available the whole campaign. So, what did you think of the debate? Tell us in the comments below. ",0,0,1

808,"The rioters in Charlotte may think they’re protesting racism and police brutality, but the only racists to be found in that city are them. The National Guard has been called in due to the rioting over a black cop killing a black man who the cops say came out of his car pointing a gun. In the past two days rioters attempted to throw a photographer in a fire last, three officers were hurt, a man was shot and is on life support, stores and the local arena were trashed. Obviously the live of the black cop doesn’t matter, as I doubt there would’ve been a riot if he was killed instead. In Charlotte, white people and journalists are fair game for attack. For some reason, Hillary Clinton has taken the sides of these rioters in attempting to pander to the Black Lives Matter crowd, which is going to backfire for her. Most black people hate BLM, she’s only going to attract a fringe minority to her side while alienating millions more. If you are in Charlotte, there is a way you can keep yourself save, however. As the Federalist Papers reported: A white man was able to drive through a crowd of angry protesters without incident – because he brandished his pistol. The unnamed driver approached a crowd of demonstrators chanting “No Justice! No Peace!” and waving signs that said “F**k the Police!” As the crowd began to surround him, he pulled out his weapon in his hand, stuck it out the door and pointed it at the ground. The atmosphere of the crowd immediately changed once that happened. Check out the awesome video below: Serves them right. It truly amazes me that these riots have time to stay out to late at night and block off roads as innocent people try to get through. Don’t these people have jobs to wake up for early in the morning? Oh, wait… of course not. ",0,0,1
1303,"""For 30 years you’ve been doing it, and now you just started thinking of solutions.” — Donald Trump Trump has said at least three times that Hillary Clinton has been working on trade issues, and other national policy issues, for 30 years. But as Clinton said, it hasn’t been “quite that long.” In 1986, Clinton was Arkansas first lady, and her involvement on trade policy would have been limited at best. Her first major role in national politics was as First Lady, when former President Bill Clinton won his first presidential race in 1992.",1,0,0
283,"(CNN)Rapper YG really wants you to know he doesn't like Donald Trump. While other hip-hop artists like Rick Ross, Jeezy and TI have publicly dissed the Republican presidential nominee, none have gotten as much traction as YG, and arguably, none have been as singularly focused. Check out: #GetPolitical — A CNNPolitics originial series In the lead-up to his second studio album, ""Still Brazy,"" the California rapper dropped a single called ""FDT,"" a song whose title is made up of the GOP nominee's initials and an expletive. As the track opens, YG says, ""Me and all my peoples, we always thought he was straight, influential motherf---er when it came to the business. But now, since we know how you really feel, this is how we feel. F--- Donald Trump."" Then he launches into his anthem, cursing the real estate mogul's name dozens of times. It was something of a new area for the West Coast rapper. The songs off his first album, like ""Bicken back being bool"" or ""Who do you love,"" were largely apolitical, even if they did veer into socially conscious territory once in a while. By his own admission, YG is ""not political."" He told CNN in a wide-ranging interview about his music over the summer his concerns over issues like Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric and his dismissal of police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement led him to speak out. ""He can't be counted on to handle these issues. This issue is important to the black community, period. It's life,"" YG said. ""This s--- is bigger than hip- hop. ... We're supposed to use our platform to speak up and bring our brothers together and put some light on some of this s--- that's not right for our people."" YG also called out other rappers for not speaking out against what he considers a ""racist"" campaign. He said they were putting their personal interests and fear of backlash over their beliefs. ""They're scared on what comes with it, what could come with it,"" YG said, adding, ""They're not doing business with Trump. ... They're saying they ain't political. They ain't going to get into all this s---... I'm not political either bro, but guess what? All that s--- matters."" YG said that fear of backlash is not unfounded, and added that he has faced repercussions over his song. He told TMZ in April that the US Secret Service reached out to his record label after he dropped ""FDT."" ""If I talk about him on my album, they're gonna try to take it off the shelf,"" YG told TMZ. Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor declined to verify or deny those claims, telling CNN, ""The Secret Service does not discuss protective investigations."" What hip hop lyrics tell us about Donald Trump Potential Secret Service warnings aside, the Compton rapper hasn't let up. In May 2016, he released a video where he read the lyrics to ""FDT"" from behind a podium, offering the lines as a point-by-point rebuttal to a Trump speech. Just before the Republican National Convention, YG released ""FDT Part 2,"" a remix featuring unlikely YG collaborators Macklemore and G-Eazy. On his verse to close out the song, YG nods to the two white rappers joining him and says of Trump, ""your own kind don't even like you."" ""I'm on tour with two of the biggest white rappers in the game right now,"" YG said. ""(The) fan base a little different than mine. So I'm touching a lot of new people that I ain't never touched before. So it's a good thing. That's what it's about."" But YG did not leave it at that either. In mid-August, he announced a nationwide ""F--- Donald Trump"" tour, giving the song a final whirl before Election Day. Then in mid-September he released a skit teasing his tour, where an actor playing Trump says ""what do they got to lose,"" recalling the Republican nominee's outreach to African Americans. What hip hop lyrics tell us about Hillary Clinton The rapper has not decided whether he will vote in November and said that his opposition to Trump is not a show of support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. ""Out of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, I would rather Clinton be president but just overall, I would rather Obama have a third term,"" YG said. ",1,0,0
148,"This should come as no surprise to most of us, but Trump supporter Don King let the âN-wordâ slip out during a recent speech in an Ohio Church. Itâs also unlikely that youâll be surprised at the fact that Trump was sitting right behind him, smiling with glee when it happened. Trump LOVED hearing the âN-wordâ (screenshot) CNN commentator Angela RyeÂ spoke about this terrible incident with a Trump supporter, and the racism behind the Trump campaign got even worse. When Rye asked white Trump surrogate Joseph Borelli to âPlease tell me that you understandâ how offensive it was to use the âN-wordâ in 2016, she didnât quite get the answer she was hoping for. In fact, it was the exact opposite. The white panelist basically said that since rappers use the âN-wordâ, itâs fair game for Don King and everyone else. Borelli said: âHave you not listened to music where other African-Americans use language far worse than this?â Rye couldnât believe her ears, andÂ gave Borelli a chance to save himself as she begged, âPlease donât do that to me. Please donât do that to me, today.â And of course, the dense Trump supporter didnât take the hint: âI am going to do it, though. You canât say that Don King is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable. Itâs not one that I would use, but itâs perhaps a word that Don King would use.â Thatâs when Rye went off and tore him a new one. In making her point, Rye warned, âWhat Iâm saying to you,Â is this trivializes your candidateâs black outreach.â You can watch Rye shred Borelli below: @CorporateBarbie@metroadlib RT @keithboykin: .@angela_rye for the win! #DonKingpic.twitter.com/otd8owrCU7 â Thanks for Asking (@ykesha2001) September 21, 2016 Rye also didnât hesitate to point out the fact that Trump was smirking during the âN-wordâ-heavy speech, which will undoubtedly create more trust issues with African American voters: .@angela_rye on Trump surrogate using the N word during a minority outreach event https://t.co/fVy4GUzMZU â Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) September 21, 2016  ",0,1,0
1135,"Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday refused to take a position on Donald Trump’s controversial proposal to increase the use of stop-and-frisk tactics to reduce crime in African-American communities such as Chicago. During a Fox News town hall taped Wednesday, the real estate tycoon said law enforcement should increase its use of stop-and-frisk to curb ""black-on-black crime."" Story Continued Below “I would do stop-and-frisk,” Trump told Sean Hannity. “We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive.” Ryan — who said earlier this week he hopes the House can pass criminal justice reform during the lame-duck session — deferred when asked about Trump's statements. “I haven’t given enough thought to it,” the Wisconsin Republican said, later adding: “I’m not a Judiciary guy so I would defer to [Judiciary Chairman] Bob Goodlatte about the constitutionality of police tactics. I can’t speak to that.” The New York City Police Department’s stop-and-frisk practices were ruled unconstitutional by a federal court in the summer of 2013 because they were found to be racially discriminatory. Trump's pitch came on the heels of more violence in Charlotte, North Carolina, Wednesday evening, during protests that followed the recent killings of two black men by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency and one civilian was reported to be on life support after being shot during a protest. On Thursday, Democrats slammed Trump's suggestion. “Donald Trump is a national embarrassment and I’m looking forward to Nov. 8 when this long national nightmare will end,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said when asked about Trump’s stop-and-frisk idea. “He constantly throws out things that have no basis in reality.” “The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous and Donald Trump needs to check his facts,"" Jeffries added. Another New York Democrat, Rep. Gregory Meeks, said Trump's rhetoric was really about mobilizing his base, not appealing to black voters. “This is supposed to be his alleged roll out to get closer and get more African American votes,"" Meeks said. ""What Donald Trump is really doing, and he’s done it throughout, he’s tried to present a stereotype of African Americans that fits the description of some of the individuals who support him who are deplorable so that they can turn out in this vote.”",1,0,0
914,"After months of quiet, mass shootings once again shake the nation. Around six a.m this morning, a “disgruntled lawyer” opened fire at a mall in Houston, Texas, injuring nine before he was killed by police officers. Shooter Nathan Desai was found to have had multiple weapons in his vehicle – all of them legal, as was his right to openly carry his weapons into a public space. As this man was not a Muslim, the media narrative is that Desai was apparently a “disgruntled” lawyer who was frustrated with his firm’s closing due to lack of customers. But this story gets even weirder. Law enforcement sources said that the shooter was wearing what appeared to be an antique German uniform with swastikas on it, and reports indicate that more Nazi paraphernalia was discovered in his apartment. Why Desai was wearing a Nazi uniform, where he got it, and any relation to white supremacy or neo-Nazi groups are still unclear at the moment. But his attempt to slaughter his countrymen was the 288th mass shooting in this country so far this year, according to watchdog group GunViolenceArchive.org.

I have a lot of madness in my family. So far I have escaped it.” Soros has made his wealth on the backs of millions in poverty, yet he is the king of decrying how unfair America is because of its greatness. He has, in fact, created more poverty around the world than he could ever complain about!  Why doesn’t he just give away his money to the poor, and live as he would like others to live?

499,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton forced Donald Trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate Monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. Clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of Trump's strongest attacks. She delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" she said. ""And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing."" Trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans. But the debate highlighted Trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the Iraq War and his contention that Clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims at the first debate Appearing in the ""spin room"" after the debate to talk to journalists, Trump said he was happy with his performance. ""It went better than I ever thought,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt Clinton won compared to 27% for Trump. The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCain. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump's recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US -- a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a ""racist lie."" ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton's tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'Holier than thou' ""You treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way,"" he said. ""When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work."" As the debate ended, Clinton hammered Trump over his treatment of women. ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,"" Clinton said. She accused Trump of calling a Latina contestant in a beauty contest ""Miss Piggy"" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing Trump off as he twice asked ""Where did you find this?"" Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. ""I know you live in your own reality,"" she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at Hofstra University on New York's Long Island. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. From there, the drama quickly unfolded. An increasingly angry Trump slammed Clinton for putting her plans to fight ISIS on her website -- and thereby tipping off America's enemy. ""Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" Clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a ""secret"" plan to destroy the terrorist group. Battling over taxes Clinton also hit Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. ""Why won't he release his tax returns?"" Clinton asked. ""Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is,"" she went on. ""Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be,"" ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes."" Clinton pressed Trump on the issue, saying ""There is something he is hiding."" Trump replied that he would release his taxes when Clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. When Clinton said that Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump replied ""That makes me smart."" Clinton also set about Trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself ""The King of Debt"" and accusing him of ""stiffing"" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. When the debate turned to racial issues and crime, Clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. Trump accused Clinton of refusing to say the phrase ""law and order"" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. He said that African-Americans and Hispanics were ""living in hell."" ""You walk down the street, you get shot,"" Trump said. Clinton rebuked Trump for painting ""such a dire picture"" of black communities. Campaign at a critical point Trump and Clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before Election Day. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. In Pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found Clinton in a virtual tie against Trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. The former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Nationally, CNN's Poll of Polls finds Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. Debate prep The rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. Clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide Philippe Reines playing Trump. In one practice debate, Reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising Clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. Reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that Trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare Clinton for her unpredictable foe. The Republican nominee has watched videos of Clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. He did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for Clinton. CNN's Dana Bash, Dylan Byers and Sara Murray contributed to this report",1,0,0
519,"Washington (CNN)The FBI has asked to examine the cell phones of a small number Democratic Party staffers as it investigates a possible hack, law enforcement and Democratic sources told CNN Tuesday. The development comes on the same day Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told lawmakers that 18 states have asked for help in warding off cyberattacks on their electronic voting systems. Law enforcement officials have reached out to the staffers individually about ""imaging"" their phones to search for evidence of hacking, such as malware. Investigators are still probing whether this attempted hack is part of the original breach of Democratic National Committee emails -- which is widely thought to be the work of the Russian government -- or a new hacking attempt. ""Our struggle with the Russian hackers that we announced in June is ongoing -- as we knew it would be -- and we are choosing not to provide general updates unless personal data or other sensitive information has been accessed or stolen,"" interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile told CNN. Meanwhile, Johnson outlined to the Senate Homeland Security Committee the concerns states had about defending their voting systems from hackers. ""We are seeing a limited number of instances where there have been efforts through cyberintrusions to get into the online presence of various state election agencies,"" Johnson said. Law enforcement and election officials said in August that hackers had breached databases for election systems in Arizona and Illinois. ""What we are seeing are efforts to get into voter registration rolls, the identity of registered voters,"" Johnson added. While Johnson would not say who was behind the latest hacks, their reveal comes less than a week after the top Democrats on Congress' intelligence committees blamed Russian intelligence agencies for a series of hacks designed to influence the US presidential election. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking members on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively, released a joint statement Thursday blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government for the cyberintrusions. ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the US election,"" they wrote. Russia's suspected role in efforts to hack systems relating to US elections was a major theme in Monday's debate between Republican nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Clinton also faulted the Russians for the election-related cyberintrusions while Trump said ""it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."" Asked about the latest hacking reports, Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" Tuesday that it was ""very serious business,"" adding that, ""Unfortunately, I think we are going to see more of it."" Schiff called Trump's refusal to blame the Russians for the cyberintrusions ""troubling,"" saying Trump ""has essentially become an apologist for the Kremlin."" ""My guess, Wolf, is if this guy weighs 400 pounds, he is sitting somewhere in Russia right now,"" Schiff added. Asked in July whether Russia was trying to use cyberattacks to influence US elections, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Russia believes it is reacting to what it sees as US attempts to destabilize Russia. ""Try to look at things from their vantage, I think. They are paranoid,"" he told an audience at the Aspen forum. ""They believe that we are trying to influence political developments in Russia and trying to effect change and so their natural response is to retaliate and do unto us as they think we have done unto them,"" Clapper added.

875,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims to have “a great relationship with the blacks“while nearly every poll shows Trump losing the constituency by 80 percent or more. One of Trump’s vile advisers went so far as to say Trump doesn’t speak in front of predominately black crowds because he fears for his life, and with Trump’s recent disgusting comments in North Carolina about black voters, it is no surprise as to why. The failed businessman gave a rambling, fact lacking, nonsensical speech in Kenansville, North Carolina where he lamented about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s lack of foreign policy experience, despite Clinton being the most qualified presidential candidate in American history. After Trump’s failed attack, he moved on show the nation why black voters do not support his candidacy : Our African American communities are in the worse shape they’ve ever been… Ever. Ever. Ever. This single tweet explains Trump’s racism perfectly:    It is quite convenient for Trump to neglect eras of history in the United States where black individuals were in, as he put it, “worse shape.” Apparently, Trump forgot the ancient times of less than 60 years ago, where black people were dehumanized, beaten, and shot with fire hoses while they attempted to fight for equal and fair treatment under the law. If Trump were to look at his history book, which isn’t going to happen because the only books he owns are about how Hitler was a swell guy, he’d find it wasn’t until 1967 that the Supreme Court struck down anti-interracial marriage laws in seventeen states making it legal for black and white people to marry anywhere in the United States. Perhaps the fake billionaire meant that black people were better off in America as slaves? That would be one of Trump’s best business concepts towards profits. Trump would reason black individuals would be fools not to prefer slavery, as they would be losing out on confirmed lifelong job security. The pandering by Trump to the vilest racists among his ignorant constituency is no longer a dog whistle, but a blatant declaration that America as a nation is divided by race. He is implicitly longing to return to an era of segregated bathrooms, restaurants, and water fountains. Trump highly preferred America when good honest white folks were given all of the best seats on public transportation, and black people, of who Trump said “laziness is a trait in black people” is doing them a favor by forcing them to walk to the back of the bus. Trump’ deplorable ‘s character is on display for all to see, and his ignorant comments have done him no favors in helping to win over a key constituency he needs to win if he hopes to capture the White House. Despite North Carolina being the state with the 7th largest black population, there is willy-nilly a black face in the entire crowd. Watch all of Trump’s heinous speech below, if you must. ",0,1,0

1093,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday lamented the deaths of two African-American men this week by police officers, calling such killings “unbearable” and adding that they need “to become intolerable.” Clinton’s remarks on the shootings, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the other in Charlotte, North Carolina, came at the top of a speech that was billed as focusing on economic issues. But the former secretary of state told the Orlando, Florida, crowd that she felt compelled to address the news of the day. Story Continued Below “There is still a lot we don’t know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,” she said. “Look, I know I don’t have all the answers. I don’t know anyone who does. But this is certain: Too many people have lost their lives who shouldn’t have.“ Clinton bemoaned not just the two police-involved deaths from this week, but also violence against police that occurred last week in Philadelphia and Tuesday night in Charlotte. She balanced calls for an end to the killings of black men at the hands of law enforcement with praise for the police departments that handled a mass-stabbing attack in Minnesota and explosions in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. “I’ve spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and as deeply committed as I am to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers,” she said. “I’ve also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country’s concerned, their lives seem disposable. We’ve got to do better. And I know we can. And if I’m elected president, we will.” From there, Clinton returned to her speech’s stated topic: “building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.” She called for the inclusion of more women in the labor force, improved access to affordable education, and immigration reform, which Clinton said would help families and be a boon for the U.S. economy. But the former secretary of state spent the bulk of her speech calling for improved economic opportunities for Americans with disabilities, a group she said is “too often invisible — overlooked and undervalued.” As president, Clinton said she would seek to advance employment opportunities for those with disabilities and make higher education more accessible to them as well. She also called for the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. “Men and women, boys and girls who have talents, skills, ideas and dreams for themselves and their families, just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country,” she said. “And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We’ve got to face that, and do better, for everyone’s sake. Because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans.”",1,0,0

Story Continued Below In a head-to-head between the two major party nominees, Clinton’s lead expands to 7 percentage points, 48 percent to 41 percent. Four percent of respondents said they would not vote for president, while 3 percent said they were undecided. Among registered voters, a majority of support for Clinton is just that — support for Clinton (as opposed to support against Trump). Half of the registered voters backing Clinton said their vote is more for Clinton, while 44 percent characterized it as more against Trump. On the Republican side, only 41 percent of registered voters said their vote is for Trump (51 percent said it was against Clinton). Registered voters gave Trump the edge as the candidate who would be best in dealing with the economy, but they favored Clinton when it came to dealing with immigration, changing the country for the better, being a good commander in chief and handling nuclear weapons. Both candidates virtually tied on the issue of terrorism and national security, with Clinton claiming a narrow 1-point advantage. Clinton is still stuck with the stigma that she’s dishonest, though more voters believe she’s honest and straightforward now than in June. About 3-in-10 said she is honest and straightforward, a mark 10 percentage points lower than the 41 percent who identified Trump as such. But it’s Clinton who registered voters say has the right temperament, knowledge and experience to handle the presidency. While 56 percent said Clinton has the right temperament and 60 percent said she has the knowledge and experience necessary to handle the job, just 23 percent said the same of Trump on both issues. Voters also said they care less about Clinton’s recent health issues than Trump’s taxes and cited the real estate mogul’s rhetoric toward women, immigrants and Muslims; his temperament; Clinton’s private server during her tenure as secretary of state; and her judgment in Syria, Iraq and Libya as their top concerns. The survey of 922 likely voters was conducted Sept. 16-19 via landline and cellphone. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.",1,0,0
866,"Republicans have been crossing party lines to announce their votes for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout this year’s general election in numbers not seen in decades. Now, Politico reports that the highest level defection yet comes from former President George H. W. Bush, who revealed to a Kennedy that it was time to go public in favor of the Democratic party’s candidate Hillary Clinton: Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. The Republican Party’s embrace of unrepentant racism under Trump is personally stinging to the Bush family after his sons Jeb Bush married women of Hispanic origins and learned Spanish. It’s no surprise that the eldest Bush of the bunch would declare early his vote for Hillary Clinton. Both of Texas’ major daily newspapers in Houston and Dallas, who are both deeply conservative news organizations, endorsed Hillary Clinton long before this year’s presidential debates, which kick off next week. It must be reassuring to the elder statesman’s rare crossing of party lines, knowing that he can trust the depth of Hillary Clinton’s national security experience and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched by any party’s nominee in possibly all of our nation’s history. Former President George H.W. Bush won’t be the last prominent Republican to declare for Hillary Clinton in this year’s General Election, but he is one of the few whose judgement we can actually respect.",0,1,0
949,"Lawmakers rolled into the Capitol earlier this month bracing for one last round of fireworks before sprinting out of town until after the election. But as Congress prepares to wrap up as early as this week leaving the Capitol dark until November, lawmakers are exiting more with a whimper than a bang. Story Continued Below The reason? Everybody’s got Election Day on the brain. “I’m glad there wasn’t [drama],” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said in an interview. “I think right now everybody is focused on Nov. 8 and any consequential legislative action probably doesn’t take place until after that.” That warning of a government shutdown Harry Reid delivered heading into the session? Not happening. “I think the Senate probably [finishes] by the middle of the week and us maybe by the end, maybe spill over into the week after,” said a relaxed Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member on the House Appropriations Committee, when asked to predict how they wrap up. The Senate has teed up a key procedural vote Monday on a stopgap bill to fund government agencies until mid-December, after staffers worked over the weekend to put the finishing touches on a proposal that would satisfy both sides. Most of the wrangling — over Planned Parenthood language related to Zika funding, disaster relief for flooded Louisiana and internet domain oversight — has unfolded behind the scenes. The Senate has taken the lead, a move some considered necessary after House conservatives threatened to withhold support for a bill that didn’t go into next year. “I’d rather it start [the process in the House], but I think the speaker had enough of a challenge to go from six months to three months and considers that, I think, his contribution to the cause,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “When you’re writing a bill in one house, then that house dominates the framework.” The funding détente is considered a loss for House GOP hard-liners, who were initially pushing for a bill that funded government agencies into early next year, which would have forced a new Congress to relitigate the issue with a new president. But even House conservatives seem resigned to a continuing resolution (CR) that ends in December, even if they don’t like it. “For people who think that a short-term CR is better than a long-term CR, it just doesn’t make much sense to me,” said Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. But, “because Senate Republicans have caved, really the only likely path forward is a short-term CR,” he added. One unrelated issue could still produce some 11th-hour drama. Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) has threatened to force a vote to impeach the IRS commissioner this week, even after House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) reached a last-minute deal to postpone the vote until after the election. Under the terms of the handshake agreement, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will testify before the Judiciary Committee Wednesday under oath, giving Jordan and other Freedom Caucus members the hearing they’d been demanding for months. Still, Koskinen’s lawyers sent a letter to Goodlatte Friday warning that the hearing wasn’t an official impeachment proceeding and shouldn’t be treated as such. “Testimony under oath from a single witness — before he has even been allowed to see any evidence against him and with no right to present corroborating evidence to address false or mistaken allegations — is no substitute,” Koskinen’s lawyers wrote. It remains to be seen what Huelskamp will do. His spokesman Jon Meadows did not return multiple requests from POLITICO seeking clarification on the congressman’s plans. The House Freedom Caucus hasn’t voted to officially support the deal to push a floor vote on Koskinen until after the election, but insiders expect the group’s members to get behind it. That has Republicans on the other side of the Capitol breathing a sigh of relief. “I know there are a lot of people who feel passionately over [in the House] about that vote but I’m not sure, at this point, what that accomplishes,” Thune said. “I just think that was some drama that probably wasn’t necessary right now.”",1,0,0

663,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post. On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part, (…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is. Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

1267,"Donald Trump is a racist, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon, and the media has been negligent by refusing to label him as such. “Virtually every time Donald Trump says or does something discriminatory -- and that's often -- the media relies upon a catalog of buzzwords to describe his actions,” Reid (D-Nev.) said Monday. “The press uses words like hateful, intolerant, bigot, extremist, prejudice, to name but a few. Yet there's always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid: racist. They never label Trump as a racist. But he is a racist. Donald Trump is a racist.” Story Continued Below In his Senate floor remarks, Reid said “racist is a term I don’t throw around lightly,” and detailed a handful of the allegations of discriminatory behavior leveled against the GOP nominee. The Nevada senator recalled the housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump in the 1970s, when his real estate company was sued for steering minority applicants away from buildings with mostly white tenants and marking their applications with a “c” or the number nine. He also quoted a former employee of one of Trump’s Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos who recalled an edict from the Manhattan billionaire that black employees be pulled off the casino floor whenever he visited. Reid said Trump’s racism has “reached new heights” during his White House bid. He ticked off Trump’s support for the so-called “birther” movement, his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States and his comment — uttered when he first announced his candidacy — that Mexican immigrants ""are bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.” He also highlighted Trump’s attacks against U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who the Manhattan billionaire has accused of bias in presiding over a fraud case against him because of the judge’s Mexican heritage. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called Trump’s attacks “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” “Here we are seven weeks from Election Day, and the speaker of the house and Senate Republican leader are both endorsing this racist man. We probably should not support a man for president who by their speaker's own admission is a textbook definition of a racist,” Reid said. “Think of the example he's setting for our nation's youth. Republicans are normalizing this racist behavior. This will be their legacy, one of them. They got plenty to add to that.” “It's time for Republicans to stop closing their eyes to Donald Trump's racism, and it's time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the American people,” Reid added. “They owe America the truth. Through his words and deeds, Donald Trump is a racist.”",1,0,0
1210,"Bruce Springsteen called Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump a “moron” in an excerpt from an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published Friday. “The republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it's a tragedy for our democracy,” the rocker said, when asked what he makes of the “Trump phenomenon”. Story Continued Below Springsteen criticized Trump’s rhetoric, saying, “The ideas he's moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas — white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he's done — not immediately disavowing David Duke?” Springsteen said that the things Trump has said and done would have ended any previous candidate’s campaign “immediately."" “I believe that there's a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization [in the U.S.],” he said, adding, “Trump's thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing.” Springsteen also offered strong words of support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, saying, “I like Hillary. I think she would be a very, very good president.” When asked whether he’s given up on trying to impact the race, he said, “I don't know. I think you have a limited amount of impact as an entertainer, performer or musician.” However, he said he would consider getting involved with the election, adding, “I did it at the time because I felt the country was in crisis, which it certainly is right now.”",1,0,0
12,"One of the victims wounded in a stabbing at a central Minnesota mall says the man who carried out the attack showed no emotion and his eyes looked blank. Ryan Schliep, one of 10 people who suffered wounds that were not life-threatening before the attacker was fatally shot, told WCCO-TV that the man ""just walked right at me"" before striking quickly and penetrating the skin of his scalp. ""He looked just blank in the eyes like he wasn't even there,"" Schliep said shortly before being released from a St. Cloud hospital. Authorities are treating Saturday's stabbings at Crossroads Center Mall as a possible act of terrorism, in part because an Islamic State-run news agency claimed that the attacker was a ""soldier of the Islamic State"" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a U.S.-led anti-IS coalition. But it wasn't immediately known whether the extremist group had planned the attack or knew about it beforehand. St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson said Monday the attack appeared to be the work of a single individual and there was no sign that the attacker, identified as 20-year-old Dahir Adan, was radicalized or communicated with any terrorist group. President Barack Obama said the stabbings had no apparent connection to weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey. Because Adan was Somali, leaders of the state's large Somali community acknowledged the prospect of a ""long winter"" for their people after the stabbings, but warned not to quickly accept the terrorism connection. ""We cannot give ISIS and other terrorist organizations more air time and propaganda without real facts,"" said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Minnesota chapter. Little is known about Adan, who was identified Sunday by his father, Ahmed Adan, and then by St. Cloud police Monday night. He had only a traffic ticket on his record, was apparently out of work after his job as a part-time security guard ended and hadn't enrolled in college since the spring semester. Adan was wearing a security guard's uniform during the attack. A spokesman for the family, Abdi Wahid Osman, read from a statement expressing condolences for the injured and anyone else who was impacted. ""As we mourn the death of our son, Dahir Adan, who was very dear to us, we are in deep shock as everyone else is in the state of Minnesota,"" the statement said. Federal officials released no new information Monday on the investigation into the stabbing, which was stopped by an off-duty police officer just minutes into it. FBI Special Agent in Charge Rick Thornton has said authorities were digging into Adan's background and possible motives, looking at social media accounts and electronic devices and talking to people he knew. Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali population, an estimated 57,000 people. Both Anderson and Gov. Mark Dayton warned against a possible backlash due to the stabbings, especially in St. Cloud, where Somalis in the 65,000-resident city about 65 miles (104 km) northwest of Minneapolis have spoken about mistreatment in the past. ""I implore the citizens of St. Cloud and the citizens of Minnesota to rise above this incident and remember our common humanity,"" Dayton said. ""It's going to be tough times. We know it's going to be a long winter for this community,"" said Haji Yusuf, who is part of UniteCloud, a local group founded to tackle racial and ethnic tension in the city. Last year, St. Cloud school officials met with Somali parents, community elders and students after Somali-American students walked out to protest their treatment. One student had said Somali-Americans were called Islamic State members and had their headscarves pulled off, and a photo posted on social media of a Somali-American student who was using a wheelchair after breaking her leg with a caption that said she was ""disabled in ISIS."" Five years earlier, CAIR's Minnesota chapter asked for a federal civil rights investigation into allegations that Muslim students had been harassed at two St. Cloud high schools. A 2011 agreement resolved the case, but the U.S. Department of Education still was monitoring the case last year. In 2013, CAIR called on police in nearby Waite Park to reject a training program about Somalis because a flier unfairly suggested the activities of al-Shabab — a militant group in east Africa that has had success in recruiting Somali-Americans in Minnesota — are supported by most Muslims. If the stabbings are ultimately deemed a terrorist act, it would be the first carried out by a Somali on U.S. soil. Adan was employed by the security firm Securitas, and was assigned for a few months to an Electrolux factory near the mall, Electrolux spokeswoman Eloise Hale said. His father, speaking through an interpreter, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he was 22, but court records and a driver's license database showed his age as 20. Police also said he was 20. A spokesman for St. Cloud State University confirmed that Adan was a student majoring in information systems, but hadn't enrolled since the spring semester. Yusuf, who has spoken with Adan's parents, said Adan went to the mall to pick up an iPhone. Yusuf said Adan seemed happy when left the home, which was the last time his parents saw him. A person at the T-Mobile store where Yusuf said Adan had gone declined to comment or take a message for his supervisor. Five minutes after authorities received the first 911 call, Jason Falconer, a part-time officer in the city of Avon who was there shopping, began shooting the attacker as he was lunging at him with the knife, Anderson said, and continued to engage him as the attacker got up three times. Avon Police Chief Corey Nellis said Monday that Falconer owns a firing range and is the city's firearms instructor. ""If I was going to ask anybody to fire ... live rounds in a crowded mall, I would trust his abilities next to anybody's,"" Nellis said. The mall reopened Monday after being closed Sunday. ——— Forliti reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski and John Mone contributed to this report from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Jeff Baenen contributed from Minneapolis. ——— This story has been corrected to show that the Electrolux facility is near, but not in the Crossroads Center mall at St. Cloud. It also has been corrected to reflect that Adan's age to 20, rather than 22, and to reflect that Yusuf's group is UniteCloud, rather than OneCloud.",1,0,0
309,"(CNN)The arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man suspected of Saturday's bombing in New York and explosion in New Jersey, is reviving a debate that's become familiar when American citizens are implicated in terrorism post-9/11: Whether or not they can be considered enemy combatants. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and others have suggested that Rahami be detained by the military as an enemy combatant, in part so he would not have be read his Miranda rights. Here are five common questions about terrorism suspects and the legal system: 1) Do U.S.-citizen terrorism suspects arrested within the United States have constitutional protections in the first place? Yes. There are ongoing debates over the constitutional rights of non-citizens (and citizens traveling overseas), but the Supreme Court has never suggested that a US citizen arrested within the United States receives lesser constitutional protection simply because he's a terrorism suspect. To the contrary, as Justice Felix Frankfurter once wrote: ""The safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies involving not very nice people."" Put more bluntly, providing US-citizen terrorism suspects with full constitutional protection is how we can be sure, as a society, that they're punished according to principles of justice, rather than vengeance. 2) Can such individuals be detained by the military? Probably not. A federal statute enacted in 1971 (in response to the World War II-era Japanese American internment camps) prohibits the detention of US citizens ""except pursuant to an Act of Congress,"" and no statute expressly authorizes the detention without trial of US-citizen terrorism suspects. The Supreme Court has held that the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), enacted by Congress one week after 9/11, implicitly authorizes the detention of US citizens captured in Afghanistan while fighting on behalf of al Qaeda or the Taliban. But four justices have suggested that the AUMF does not authorize the detention of even those individuals when captured within the United States -- and without such an affiliation, there's no argument that the AUMF applies. 3) Can US-citizen terrorism suspects be prosecuted in the Guantánamo military commissions? No. When Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act of 2006, it expressly limited the statute to ""alien"" defendants. And although there are precedents from World War II for trying US citizens in military commissions, that's only when the citizen is accused of international war crimes (which terrorism, by itself, is not). 4) Can US-citizen terrorism suspects be interrogated? Absolutely. No rule, statute, or constitutional provision prevents the government from interrogating terrorism suspects -- so long as none of the interrogation methods involve torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (prohibitions that today apply equally whether the interrogation is conducted by the FBI, the military, and the CIA). There are many examples of lawful interrogations in terrorism cases producing actionable intelligence information. 5) At what point do US-citizen terrorism suspects have to be apprised of their Miranda rights? Not right away. First, Miranda is only an exclusionary rule -- meaning that the penalty for interrogating a suspect without reading him his rights is simply the exclusion of his statements from his trial. Second, even if admissibility at trial were an issue, the Supreme Court has recognized a ""public safety"" exception to Miranda, where the interrogation is designed to identify future threats to the public, and not to elicit further evidence of the suspect's guilt. Thus, in the case of the so-called ""underwear bomber,"" the government conducted a substantial interrogation of the suspect before reading him his rights, but was still allowed to use his statements during that period against him at trial. Finally, there's no direct correlation between the provision of Miranda rights and a suspect's refusal to cooperate. So in a case like this one, there's little reason to think that Miranda really does prevent the government from taking necessary steps to prevent future acts of terrorism.

1525,"People always think that bad things happen to “other people.” If we’re lucky, we float through life never having to endure harrowing situations of life and death. However, too often, “regular” folks become the target of criminals. Citizens are mugged walking down the street; they are awoken by shattering glass as their suburban castle is violated by intruders. While many people throughout the world must suffer at the hands of criminals, Americans enjoy the right to bear arms and are afforded the right to defend themselves.   Early Friday morning, three armed men broke into a home in Georgia. A surveillance camera was running and authorities have released the tape to encourage the apprehension of two of the suspects. In the below footage, the trio breaks into a home filled with boxes. The occupant, a woman who reportedly is a restaurant manager who had stacked supplies for the restaurant in the home, can be seen promptly coming out of the bedroom in her pajamas with guns blazing. She began firing on the suspects almost immediately and as bullets ripped through the drywall, the robbers returned fire as they ran for their lives. One man even jumped through a window to escape the barrage of bullets. The Georgia woman kept firing and firing and even shot as they ran out the front door. One suspect was found dead on the driveway. After she ran out of ammo, the woman called 911 to report the incident. Police reported that the woman acted in accordance with the law in that she acted to defend herself and her property. Two of the suspects remain at large, but they did not cover their faces and it is likely that someone may recognize one or both of the criminals. The video is an extraordinary example of the importance of the Second Amendment. The left hates the fact that Americans have the right to defend themselves.

407,"(CNN)The Clintons are building a compound in Chappaqua, New York. Hillary and Bill Clinton have bought the house next door to their current home in Chappaqua, New York, for $1.16 million, according to deed information on the 33 Old House Lane home. The 3,631-square-foot home, which was previously owned by architect Charles Chepigin, was sold to the Clintons on August 11, according to the documents. The Clintons currently own the the 5,300-square-foot home at 15 Old House Lane, a property they bought in 1999 as Bill Clinton was leaving the White House and Hillary Clinton was running for Senate in New York. That home was purchased for $1.7 million. By purchasing the new home, the Clinton's now own the entire cul-de-sac at the end of the road in the leafy New York suburb. The purchase makes it easier for the United States Secret Service to protect the former president and possible future commander in chief. Months ago, gawkers were able to drive up to the Clinton's gate and take photos. Reporters assigned to Clinton regularly position outside the home. But the New Castle Town Board voted in August to designate the lane a local-traffic-only street, meaning that there is no parking allowed on either side of the drive. Shortly after that decision, agents protecting Clinton barricaded the street and began to screen cars at the start of the cul-de-sac. The Clinton's new home was listed by Douglas Elliman, a large real estate firm with a location in Chappaqua. The listing boasted about how the home was ""located close to town on a unique cul-de-sac."" Housing decisions are not uncommon for presidential candidates, but they have also landed some in hot water. Republican Mitt Romney wanted to demolish his 3,100-square-foot home in La Jolla, California, before the 2012 election in order to build a 11,000-square-foot mansion with a car elevator. The plans were put on hold until after the election and a neighbor had appealed the building decision to the California Coastal Commission because, in his view, the new home would have exceeded zoning limits. After the election -- which Romney lost -- the Coastal Commission rejected the appeal. ",1,0,0

In his lawsuit he said, “police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities including but not limited to Jews, Christians and Caucasians.” Defendants in the case include other race baiters such as Al Sharpton, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Louis Farrakhan, George Soros, and The New Black Panthers Party. Pennie reports that they have, “repeatedly incited their supporters and others to engage in threats of and attacks to cause serious bodily injury or death upon police officers and other law enforcement persons of all races and ethnicities.” Furthermore, the lawsuit contends that the defendants have encouraged their supporters and citizens, “to engage in threats and attacks” against law enforcement officers around the country, including the July 7 murders of five Dallas police officers by Micah Johnson after a Black Lives Matter demonstration.” Larry Klayman who is a renowned conservative lawyer of FreedomWatch is representing Pennie in his case. Klayman told reporters in a press release, “Sergeant Pennie and I feel duty-bound to put ourselves forward to seek an end to the incitement of violence against law enforcement which has already resulted in the death of five police officers in Dallas and the wounding of seven more, just in Texas alone.” The lawsuit spans 66-pages and seeks a whopping $500 million in compensatory damages.

1486,"Progressive liberals are only interested in “protecting children” when they get to define protection, which, apparently doesn’t involve using firearms, but it DOES include dismembering them for the mother’s convenience. Since their definition of protection is kind of wonky, one school has decided to take the safety and well-being of your child into their hands and libs are going bonkers.  To nobody’s surprise, this school is in Texas. Some of the parents are perfectly okay with the sign and knowing the people who are supposed to protect their students can actually do so, if someone comes into the building with intent to harm. “Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and I’m perfectly fine with it,” said Jillian Sides, who has two sons, one in 7th grade and one in kindergarten, at the school. The school also plans to place additional signs at all entrances to the school, so everyone entering the school knows that the teachers are packing heat. Let’s set up a scenario for the people who might be against teachers having guns. Let’s say you are dead broke and are at risk of losing your home. You decide, in a moment of desperation, that the only way to gather the money to pay off your debts is to commit robbery. So, you sit down and have a think. Do you rob a bank? Do you rob a convenience store? Do you rob your neighbor up the street? How do you make this decision? Well, banks have pretty serious security. Cameras, sometimes armed guards and buttons that alert the police to any incident taking place. The local 7/11? They installed security cameras the other day after another robbery and you know from talking to one of the clerks that they now have a shotgun under the counter. What about the neighbor who has a “proudly anti-gun” sign in their yard? Chances are that the security at that house is very low. So, any person thinking of committing a crime would be led to believe that hitting the building with the least amount of security would be the safest bet. Sorry, Mr. Jones, that means you. Criminals and crazy people know that schools are hugely gun-free zones, so they can cause the most amount of harm and chaos without fear of physical retaliation. They don’t want to be confronted by a courageous individual with the ability to stop them, so they go to places where the odds of running into one of those is very low.

102,"When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how we don’t “win anymore.” We don’t win on manufacturing. We don’t win on trade. We don’t win on economics. We don’t win against ISIS. It’s that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: “Our military can’t beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying we can’t beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. We can’t beat – right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what – they’re spinning right now. They’re watching. They’re spinning in their grave.” You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound like you’ve assured them you can win here, and you’ll do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie? You’re ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness, you’ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game. Simply act like we can win, and we’ll win. I’m sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the message he’s putting forth. He’s treating war, and terrorism, like they’re football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like we can’t beat ISIS, we’ll beat them handily. That’s not true. Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative. We didn’t. MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and we couldn’t beat them with brute force. What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually a Isn’t that giving up? Isn’t that what you’re railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because they didn’t happen. Then there’s Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance, he’s reported to have said: “We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again.” Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect. Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said, “We can’t beat ISIS.” Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team “We can’t do this,” hands the game to the other team. Our military doesn’t operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS — something you would know if you weren’t such a conceited bastard. On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it. It’s not a football game. ISIS is not WWII, and it’s not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as such doesn’t just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows that you’re wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing. As though it’s a goddamn football game. It’s not. ",0,1,0
84,"As the first presidential debate was drawing to a close, Hillary Clinton took one last chance to hammer Donald Trump, hitting at his remarks on women. “This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” Clinton said fervently from the debate stage tonight. “And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.” The Democratic presidential nominee brought up former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has said that Trump regularly bullied her when he took over the pageant in 1996, allegedly calling the Venezuelan beauty contestant “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping.”   “And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them,” Clinton said. “And he called this woman ‘Miss Piggy.’ Then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado.” Machado has since become an American citizen and has vowed to vote for Clinton, according to her Instagram.     The presidential hopefuls clashed over Trump’s remarks on women when ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor and debate moderator Lester Holt asked the Republican nominee to clarify controversial comments he made earlier that Clinton doesn’t have “a presidential look.” Trump said that by “look,” he meant “stamina.” “She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said from the stage at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. ""To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina."" Clinton soon chimed in, “One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.” While Trump denied some of Clinton’s allegations about his comments on women, he defended his harsh words for actor Rosie O’Donnell at tonight’s debate. “Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree she deserves it, and nobody feels sorry for her,” Trump said.    Back in August 2015 during the first GOP primary debate, Fox News host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly confronted Trump about using words like “fat pigs,” “dogs,” “slobs” and “disgusting animals” to describe some women. Trump interjected and said, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” ABC News' Nicole Phillip, Maggie McNish and Sunny Choo contributed to this report.",1,0,0
919,"Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton knows her facts, and during tonight’s debate she busted Trump for his ludicrous tweet calling climate change a hoax by the Chinese. While it’s true that China is a major coal user, America still relies on tons of the dirty stuff, so we’re all in this together. When Hillary Clinton first slammed Trump’s non-scientific pseudo nonsense, so Politifact rated it as “mostly true”: Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax” in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China “invented” climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change “is done for the benefit of China.”  He also referred to it with a profanity. Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air – not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014  Climate change is the number one existential fight that not only America faces, but that the world faces. Tonight, it only rated a single mention, and only because the Republican Party has been living in an alternate universe like the Trump Train on this issue for years, while seas are rising and the planet warms. It’s just another reason to vote Blue in November, if you care about the planet and our species’ continued survival. Hillary called out Trump for his madness. He lied.

363,"Washington (CNN)With two months to go before Election Day, Democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the White House, but Republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the Senate. Presidential campaigns and their supportive super PACs filed new numbers Tuesday that continue to show Clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. Clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of August; Trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. Meanwhile, a cadre of Republican donors -- most prominently, Sheldon Adelson -- are keeping Republicans competitive in down-ballot races. Here are the five takeaways from the money race: Hillary Clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires Under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few Democratic billionaires who are responsible for Clinton's advertising machine: Priorities USA. The super PAC had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. The bulk of the money is from a select few: Fred Eychaner and Daniel Abraham, who gave $3 million each, George Soros, who donated $2.5 million, Don Sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and Laurene Powell Jobs, whose LLC contributed another $2 million. Those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that Priorities USA has raised, and their names have littered Democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. Trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super PACs have failed to keep pace. Only one new name appeared on Trump's PAC's reports: Cherna Moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close Trump allies (and billionaires) Bob and Rebekah Mercer. What's Clinton's money good for? Ads Clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over Trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that Trump could not. The Democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in ""media buys."" That's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. And her campaign, joint fundraising committees and Priorities USA had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. She's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. Trump is finally raising the big bucks Despite record spending in the month of August -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- Trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. Trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the Republican National Committee. Trump finally began advertising in the month of August, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. He spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. The return of Mike Bloomberg The former New York City mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. His super PAC, Independence USA, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. But he personally is backing the Democratic ticket for president. The billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. That's his largest check ever to the super PAC. Senate Republicans have the upper hand Thanks to $21.5 million from the Adelsons, groups backing Senate Republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing Senate Democrats. The Senate Leadership Fund, an allied group in New Hampshire, and the Koch brothers' super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, raised $32.5 million in August. That also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the US Chamber of Commerce or other Koch nonprofit groups. And the Democrats? The main Senate groups -- Senate Majority PAC, Emily's List and the League of Conservation Voters -- took in only $20.5 million. Environmental activist Tom Steyer on Tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the Democratic ticket. But here's what we do know now: The Democrats don't have an Adelson equivalent. Their main Senate donor last month is Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. In the Senate cash race, Adelson is a game-changer. ",1,0,0
443,"(CNN)The mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, publicly asked Friday that the two leading presidential candidates delay plans to visit her city, which has been rocked this week by unrest following a police shooting of a black man. Hours later, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's campaigns said they were dropping plans to visit the city in the upcoming days. ""We appreciate the support of the candidates. We appreciate that they are concerned about Charlotte,"" Jennifer Roberts told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""At this point, we do have very stretched resources for security and they are working around the clock. If there would be a way to delay those visits in terms of giving us a chance to get our city back to order and back to more of a state of normalcy, that would probably be ideal."" Clinton's campaign announced late Friday that she would postpone a visit to the city after having announced that she would go to Charlotte on Sunday. An aide said the campaign had consulted with Roberts' office about the visit, and were told about concerns that a trip would drain vital city resources. A campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said Clinton will instead visit on October 2. Also late Friday, two Trump campaign officials said they were no longer considering a post-debate trip next week to the city, though they didn't mention Roberts' plea. Trump took to Twitter Friday night to criticize Clinton over her decision to announce, and then reverse, her plans to visit the city. ""Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!"" he tweeted. Trump, however, visited Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last month, days after flooding devastated the area, opening him to criticism from Clinton that he disrupted the response. The shooting of Keith Lamont Scott has sparked protests in Charlotte and is the latest incident to fuel a national discussion about lethal police force, particularly against African-Americans. Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violence Clinton called Friday for officials in Charlotte to make public a police video showing the fatal shooting of Scott. ""Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. --H,"" Clinton said in a tweet, the ""H"" indicating that she personally approved the message. Two police videos from a dashboard camera and an officer's body camera show how Scott died, but have not been released to the public. Police allowed Scott's family to view the videos Wednesday.

458,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton forced Donald Trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate Monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. Clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of Trump's strongest attacks. She delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" she said. ""And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing."" Trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans. But the debate highlighted Trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the Iraq War and his contention that Clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims at the first debate Appearing in the ""spin room"" after the debate to talk to journalists, Trump said he was happy with his performance. ""It went better than I ever thought,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt Clinton won compared to 27% for Trump. The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCain. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump's recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US -- a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a ""racist lie."" ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton's tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'Holier than thou' ""You treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way,"" he said. ""When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work."" As the debate ended, Clinton hammered Trump over his treatment of women. ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,"" Clinton said. She accused Trump of calling a Latina contestant in a beauty contest ""Miss Piggy"" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing Trump off as he twice asked ""Where did you find this?"" Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. ""I know you live in your own reality,"" she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at Hofstra University on New York's Long Island. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. From there, the drama quickly unfolded. An increasingly angry Trump slammed Clinton for putting her plans to fight ISIS on her website -- and thereby tipping off America's enemy. ""Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" Clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a ""secret"" plan to destroy the terrorist group. Battling over taxes Clinton also hit Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. ""Why won't he release his tax returns?"" Clinton asked. ""Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is,"" she went on. ""Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be,"" ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes."" Clinton pressed Trump on the issue, saying ""There is something he is hiding."" Trump replied that he would release his taxes when Clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. When Clinton said that Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump replied ""That makes me smart."" Clinton also set about Trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself ""The King of Debt"" and accusing him of ""stiffing"" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. When the debate turned to racial issues and crime, Clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. Trump accused Clinton of refusing to say the phrase ""law and order"" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. He said that African-Americans and Hispanics were ""living in hell."" ""You walk down the street, you get shot,"" Trump said. Clinton rebuked Trump for painting ""such a dire picture"" of black communities. Campaign at a critical point Trump and Clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before Election Day. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. In Pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found Clinton in a virtual tie against Trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. The former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Nationally, CNN's Poll of Polls finds Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. Debate prep The rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. Clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide Philippe Reines playing Trump. In one practice debate, Reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising Clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. Reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that Trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare Clinton for her unpredictable foe. The Republican nominee has watched videos of Clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. He did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for Clinton. CNN's Dana Bash, Dylan Byers and Sara Murray contributed to this report",1,0,0
1522,"Throughout much of the presidential campaign season, the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been a hot topic of discussion, largely owing to her several coughing fits and episodes of bizarre behavior, culminating in her near faint and collapse at the 9/11 memorial service a couple of weeks ago. Her health issues were likely a top concern of her campaign headed into the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday, as the presidential debate commission just released clarifications on debate rules that could conceivably work against Clinton. According to the Drudge Report, an unnamed source within the commission revealed that there would be no breaks during the scheduled 90-minute debate, even if Clinton suffers a coughing fit or some other minor medical issue while on stage. “There are no commercial breaks,” the source stated. “Period.” Furthermore, moderator Lester Holt of NBC has zero authority to make cameras cut away from the stage or manipulate the audio microphones in any way, meaning Clinton will have no place to hide from the eyes of potentially 100 million viewers (and voters) if she does suffer some sort of medical episode during the debate. In related news, the debate commission also shot down a request by Clinton’s campaign for a step stool that she could stand on during the debate to help compensate for the immense size difference between her and her Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is believed to stand approximately 5’4″ tall, nearly a foot shorter than the 6’2″ Trump, who will no doubt appear dominating in comparison. However, the commission was willing to provide Clinton with a custom-built podium specifically for her that should help to accommodate the obvious size difference between the two candidates. Clinton’s campaign may look at loading up their candidate with whatever drugs they are feeding her on a regular basis to prevent another coughing fit or dizzy spell on stage that would likely ruin any chance she still retains of winning the election. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word that the presidential debate will have no commercial breaks or stoppages for Clinton to hide, rest or recover if she happens to suffer another coughing fit or medical episode on stage.

1577,"NASCAR officials have been working hard for a couple weeks now on how they really ant post race inspections to look. We’ve seen NASCAR’s Executive Vice President, Steve O’Donnell, speak out several times over the matter of post race inspections and how he’d like them to go. Basically, he wants the attention off of that aspect of things so estate everyone can focus on good racing. So in order for that to happen, O’Donnell and the rest of the executives have changed the format a bit, as we all know by now! They cut out the lower two tears of the penalty system and are only focusing on issuing penalties for failing post race laser inspection if the car fails it to a large degree.  However, executives realize that this may give drivers some leeway for cheating tactics. And Steve O’Donnell is trying to nip that in the bud. In a meeting this past weekend at New Hampshire, he made himself very clear as to what their expectations from the drivers were. “I want to make clear to everybody here that in NASCAR’s judgment, any measures that are taken to circumvent what happens for postrace inspection, we are going to react. We know that’s subjective. But ask all of you not to put it in our hands because we will react if we have to. I think everybody knows what that means. We want to concentrate on the race. … We couldn’t be more clear. I hope everybody agrees with that.” It’s awesome to see the officials making themselves clear and being open about their expectations!  We’ll see how open they are in the future however, seeing that O’Donnell didn’t clarify what cheating was in their books. There are allegations that “no cheating” might even include stopping the drivers from weaving back and forth on the cool down lap. Only time will tell! ",0,0,1

Appearing on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” Obama was pressed by the comedian whether she feels any sympathy for the spouses of presidential candidates. While she initially signaled she did not have any sympathy for Trump or Bill Clinton, Colbert pressed Obama by citing the example of the criticism surrounding the plagiarism episode. “Melania Trump was so criticized for using what turned out to be a portion of your speech. But do you have any sympathy? Because there are people around her creating things, and I have some sympathy for her,” Colbert said. “Do you understand how that might be sympathetic for what happened to her?” “Yeah,” Obama finally admitted, clearly not amused by the continued questioning. “That was tough.”       Colbert picked up on Obama’s evident irritation, as she was not smiling, and quickly moved on to discuss her signature project, Let Girls Learn, which aims to educate girls around the globe who do not have access to education. Earlier in the interview, the first lady called her family’s final days in the White House “bittersweet.” “Everything’s, like, the last, and I find myself choking up because we have raised our kids in the White House,” she said. “We’ve had so many amazing experiences.

847,"For the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott’s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn’t armed and was only carrying a book. As usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott’s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another “proof” that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting. As it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there’s no reason to think he wouldn’t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported: Rakeyia Scott’s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun—even as he brandished a gun in front of them—now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children’s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they’d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, “He is no longer a threat to me and my family.” But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. “He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that,” she wrote. She said the man she’d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before. The Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah – OK. Scott’s wife told officers he didn’t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could’ve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, they’re doing so over a man who could’ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would’ve been an accomplice to their murders. ",0,0,1

The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. She’s taking money from a stone cold enemy and that’s not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country… period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we? Now it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?  From Jihad Watch: It isn’t news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves – especially Yazidi girls – but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being “sold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.” An eyewitness reported: Dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only Iraqis and Syrians trading women but also Saudis and Westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State’s practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State’s human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be ‘kafir’, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin. As these women are ‘rescued’ from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather. I have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit.

248,"White Plains, New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton cast herself Monday morning as the only presidential candidate who has fought terrorism and slammed Donald Trump's response to the incidents in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota over the weekend as ""demagogic."" In a news conference on the tarmac of Westchester County Airport, the Democratic presidential nominee said she has been ""part of the hard decision to take terrorists off the battlefield,"" and contrasted her steadiness to what she called Trump's ""irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."" ""It is like so much else he says: It is not grounded in fact, it is meant to make some kind of demagogic point,"" Clinton said. ""I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."" An explosive device went off in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan over the weekend, once again thrusting the politics of terror into the center of the 2016 election. Clinton and Trump initially responded to the incident in contrasting styles: Trump was quick to announce that a bomb had gone off in New York, even before there was much information about the incident; Clinton, meanwhile, urged caution, and the importance of waiting to draw conclusions until more information was available. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said that the Clinton campaign accused the Republican nominee of treason and criticized her previous stances on the war in Iraq. ""If Clinton really wants to find the real cause of ISIS, she needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror,"" Miller said. In her news conference Monday morning, Clinton also warned against the instinct to villainize entire groups of people based on religion. Asked about Ahmad Khan Rahami -- in custody following a police shootout after he was allegedly seen on video near the bombing -- and whether his Afghan descent will help Trump politically, Clinton said: ""There are millions of law-abiding, peaceful Muslim Americans."" ""That is why I have been very clear. We are going after the bad guys and we are going to get them, but we are not going to go after an entire religion and give ISIS exactly what it is wanting,"" Clinton said. Clinton's news conference offered no new policies to fight terror. She argued, as she has before, that the United States needs to invest more in intelligence to combat lone wolf attacks. The former secretary of state also called on tech companies in Silicon Valley to ""give us the tools and lead us to those who are attempting to promote attacks like we have seen."" Clinton has given speeches on defeating terror multiple times throughout the 2016 campaign, including policy-focused addresses in Minneapolis and New York earlier this year. ",1,0,0

136,"Scammer-turned reality show star-turned-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump chatted with Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly last night and commenced to bash our military, as one does when running for the White House while trying to garner the patriotic™ conservative vote. While insulting President Barack Obama, Donald also took shots at the military, calling troops the “gang that couldn’t shoot straight.” In just 15 seconds, Donald said “win” or “winning” nine times in less than 15 seconds while offering no details  on how he would obtain these ‘wins.’ Trump says ""win"" or ""winning"" nine times in less than 15 seconds to @oreillyfactor: pic.twitter.com/yDs6v1Jjhz — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 20, 2016  “Well, I know how to win. I know how to win. I have been winning. I do win. Even in sports. I win,” Donald told O’Reilly. “And we don’t win. Our country doesn’t win. We don’t win at trade. We don’t win. We can’t beat ISIS. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton? Can imagine they are spinning in their grave right now when they see the way we fight,” he continued. “We announce that we are sending certain people over here at a certain time. Everything is political. It’s very, very sad. Then we bomb the Syrian troops. You saw that over the weekend. We bombed, I guess we killed more than 80 troops.” Watch:  At that point, Donald seemed concerned that Russia would be upset with the U.S. even though they were consulted beforehand. And now Russia is absolutely furious at us. But we bomb the wrong people. I mean, we are like the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. Our country, with this leader, is the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. That’s what it is. The United Stats made a tactical error and accidentally bombed a detachment of Syrian government forces Saturday after mistakenly believing them to be ISIS forces. “The United States has relayed our regret through the Russian Federation for the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces,” an Obama administration official announced at the time, according to Mediaite. However, the Russians, who appear to really want a Trump administration, criticized the bombings, even though again, they raised no objections when they were consulted before the incident took place. Russian diplomats then floated a Trump conspiracy theory, because of course: After the botched strike, Russian diplomats floated a Trump conspiracy theory that the Obama administration is actively helping ISIS. In fact, wherever the Islamic State abuts his enemies, Assad has actively assisted them with his own air power, while Putin has pursued a policy of allowing extremists to leave Russia and join ISIS. Donald offered no alternatives as to how he would prevent a botched bombing. He just says the word ‘win’ repeatedly and his supporters eat it up. So does Vladimir Putin, apparently. This man wants to get his little hands on the nuclear codes. Let that sink in for a moment. Shockingly, Sean Hannity, the Patriot, has been strangely quiet since Donald bashed our military. The rest of the media is probably waiting for Hillary to cough. Photo by Sara D. Davis via Getty.",0,1,0
556,"Secretary of State John Kerry said at the Global Fishing Watch reception in D.C. that there is a small group of Americans who block every government action on global warming, because they think that once the ice caps melt – still waiting for that to happen – all that extra water will just “spill over the sides of a flat earth.”  Manmade global warming proponents are always comparing those who disagree with them to “flat-earthers.” The idea that there was a time when Christians and other “uneducated” people believed that the Earth was flat is a complete myth. That myth was promulgated largely by Darwinists in the latter part of the 19th century as a way to discredit Creationists. There wasn’t ever a time when the consensus among Christians was that the Earth was flat. This lie was perpetuated to show that Christians held to their “religious dogma” in spite of evidence discovered by “brave” and “objective” scientists who were persecuted by Christians for their discovery. So in reality, opponents of Columbus’s voyage didn’t actually say that they were concerned he might fall off the edge of the Earth. Their concern was mostly about how far he would be going in unknown territory and how much it would cost to finance such an expedition. What we do see throughout history is that the establishment of any particular field of study – whether it be science or medicine – is usually the group that holds fast to its theories in spite of new evidence and findings that might show the establishment to be in error. They hold on to their theories for political and financial reasons. They use their own clout to silence and/or ridicule those who threaten the status quo that they’ve created for themselves. And that’s just what the whole anthropogenic global warming myth is all about. They want to maintain their theories so they can benefit politically and financially from them. They can twist the scientific data to make it say whatever they want. And any scientist who tries to expose them for trying to cram inflated data inside a pre-formulated theory is ignored or discredited. We all know how an establishment treats whistleblowers.

In 1959, Joyce Wharton’s parents boarded a plane bound for Seattle. The plane crashed and her parents were never heard from again. The plane wreckage was found 15 years later, in the deep woods of Washington state, reports The Blaze. The unanswered questions Joyce and the rest of her family had lived with for so long finally were answered. ""They went out to the airport and left, but they never arrived in Seattle,"" Joyce told ABC 6. ""So for many many years, we didn't know what had happened."" Now, more than half a century later, Joyce has received a very special gift that belonged to her mother: Her wedding ring. The ring was discovered by Nick Buchanan, a Washington logger who came across it near the crash site. Buchanan wanted to find the rightful owner of the ring, and with the help of his nephew and Ancestry.com they were able to track down Joyce who lives all the way across the country in New Jersey.  Buchanan called Joyce to tell her he had found the ring and wanted to return it to her. ""He said 'Joyce, I have your mother's ring, and I've been looking for you all these years and I want you to have this,'"" Joyce said.

295,"Chappaqua, New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump. Clinton, an aide said Tuesday, will propose an economy that ""welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect."" Wednesday's speech is Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton has so far given ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families. While those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast. In all three speeches, Clinton has tried to keep her talk of Trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. And Wednesday's speech will be no different. Many low-wage workers not protected by minimum wage Clinton's campaign and Democrats view Trump's attacks on New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whose arthrogryposis impairs the movements in her arm, as their most effective character attack against the Republican nominee. Trump mocked Kovaleski during a campaign event in South Carolina last year after the reporter questioned Trump for citing his story as proof that ""thousands"" of Muslims celebrating in Jersey City, NJ, as the World Trade Center towers burned and fell during the 9/11 terror attack. Clinton turned Trump's comments into her first general election campaign ad.  By talking about what she would do for people with disabilities, Clinton is offering voters an implicit contrast with Trump. Clinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilities on Wednesday, according to the aide, including eliminating sub-minimum wages for people with disabilities and proposing ""new partnerships with businesses to improve hiring practices for those living with a disability."" After the speech Wednesday, the aide said, Clinton will be ""the only candidate with a plan for an economy that includes more people with disabilities."" ",1,0,0

According to Morning Consult, New Jersey voters give Christie a 29 percent approval rating and 68 percent disapproval rating. That's down from a 36 percent approval rating in the spring, and not far behind the two worst ranked governors. Story Continued Below Republican Sam Brownback of Kansas fares the worst, with a 23 percent approval rating and 71 percent disapproval rating. Democrat Dan Malloy of Connecticut has a 26 percent approval rating and a 70 percent disapproval rating. The numbers in the Morning Consult poll are actually slightly better for Christie than a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Monday, which showed 26 percent of voters approving of his job performance and 69 percent disapproving, while just 23 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the governor. Both surveys were conducted before the Bridgegate trial got underway on Monday — a spectacle that has already proven embarrassing for Christie amid the prosecution's claims that he knew of the George Washington Bridge access lane closings as they happened.

151,"Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) has been caught red-handed lying about the details of his military service, and it isnât the first time he has done it. From The : CNN reported Wednesday that Kirkâs campaign website erroneously stated that he is âa veteran of the Iraq War.â In reality, the senator stayed in the United States during the war as he served in the Navy Reserve. His campaign chalked it up to a staff error, saying that particular page on Kirkâs website was not meant to be public and that staff members were making edits to it. Staff moved the page behind a password-protected firewall after CNN investigated. Kirk, who is up for re-election this year, has previously been caught in the middle of lies about his military career. He claimed in 2010 that he had been named âIntelligence Officer of the Year,â when the award was for work his entire unit had done. He also promoted a story alleging that his reconnaissance plane had come under fire, but there was no record of that. Kirk claimed that he had served in âcombatâ in Kosovo, but he didnât. He claimed he had been deployed to Afghanistan, but he had been sent there for training, not for combat service. He also previously falsely claimed to have been deployed to combat in Operation Desert Storm. Kirkâs lies about his service would be a major issue at any time, but they are even more notable because he is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). Duckworth is an actual combat veteran who served in the Iraq War. In that conflict, Duckworth received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.

Christopher Stevens,” commemorating the sacrifice of Stevens and the other Americans who died in the attack on the American diplomatic compound in September of 2012. She speculated as to the cause of Clinton’s departure from office: “Did someone tell her, ‘Listen, you made a big boo-boo and you have to get out?’ That subject has never been brought to the public.” Understandably, she said that Hillary Clinton can’t be trusted for the country — she certainly proved that she couldn’t handle the one situation that claimed the life of Denier’s fiancee. “If we cannot trust her for Americans, how can we trust her for the whole country? It doesn’t make sense. In my book, I do talk about that and about what happened … Chris was and knew, was extremely knowledgeable about Libya and what was going on. He should’ve been listened to,” said Denier. The book also took time to celebrate who Stevens was as a person. His fiancée understandably remembered him fondly. “The Chris Stevens I knew was fun and loving, caring, always putting others in front of everything instead of himself,” she said.

1593,"A McDonough, Georgia Wal-Mart employee refused to make a Thin Blue Line cake for an officer’s retirement party and it sparked an online firestorm. The cake design was relatively simple, a black and white American flag with a blue stripe in it. I’m no pastry chef, but that seems fairly easy to me. Below is an example:  But it wasn’t the ease of the cake design that kept the bakers from fulfilling the order, it was the fact that “some could perceive it as racist.” The customer, the officer’s daughter, then thought she could receive a more favorable answer by asking for just a thin blue line on a chocolate background, but the baker said she wasn’t comfortable doing that either. Confused by the resistance to make such a cake, the daughter asked the baker, “Is there something wrong with cops?” A family friend, who is also an officer, posted about the incident on Facebook:  The manager of the Wal-Mart reached out to the woman to offer her a gift cart, party supplies as well as a cake, but the damage was done. The daughter had also gone to Kroger to have the cake made. The cake that the family received was poorly made and looked completely unprofessional, according to the daughter. A picture of the cake is below:  In an exclusive interview with Todd Starnes, the daughter said that if she refused a customer’s request, she would have been fired. “I work in retail,” the officer’s daughter told Starnes. “If I didn’t want to deal with a customer — and said ‘No’ — I would get fired.” So, let’s set something straight, conservatives have already made it very clear that nobody should be forced to make a cake that they object to and it’s true, they shouldn’t. The family here did what everyone should do and they moved on to another bakery that made the cake without objection. What also happened here is what should also happen, the public put pressure on the company to either stand up for what they did, or to cave and make the cake. The free market should take care of the public’s opinion on a business. If you refuse business for any reason and you’re in a non-emergency profession, you should be able to do so. And that person who you refused should be able to go out and express their opinion about your refusal, and the public should decide whether or not to continue to visit your business and spend their money there. If this Wal-Mart was in my area, I would refuse to shop there because I fundamentally disagree with the kind of people they hire.

1259,"NEWARK, N.J. — Gov. Chris Christie’s former campaign manager — now a top aide to Donald Trump — was aware of the George Washington Bridge lane closures before they occurred and knew their intended purpose, according to the admitted mastermind of the political revenge scheme. Former Christie ally David Wildstein said in federal court on Monday that he told the governor’s longtime lieutenant, Bill Stepien, about the idea of using local access lanes as a political “leverage point” years before they occurred. Stepien was a deputy chief of staff to the governor at the time. Story Continued Below The two discussed the concept again — that lanes would be closed to create a traffic jam and punish a local mayor — when the plan was about to be set in motion, said Wildstein, a secretive political operator and former schoolmate of Christie who was appointed by the governor to a position at the authority. Stepien, by then the manager of Christie’s 2013 reelection campaign, asked about a cover story, Wildstein said. “Mr. Stepien asked about what story we were going to use, and I told Mr. Stepien we were going to use the cover of a traffic study,” he said. Stepien, who was hired this year as a national field director for Trump, has not been charged in the incident and had not been previously implicated. Christie distanced himself from Stepien after details emerged about the scheme. While Christie is currently serving as the chairman of Trump’s transition team, he has said he did not have a role in Stepien’s hiring by the Trump campaign. Wildstein, who was the director of interstate capital projects for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told jurors in U.S. District Court on Monday that he first came up with the idea of closing some local lanes to the bridge years before they occurred. The Port controls the bridge, considered to be the world’s busiest. Wildstein, who has already pleaded guilty, said he visited the bridge in March 2011. It was the first time he got an overhead view of the upper level toll booths and spotted three local lanes leaving Fort Lee. Wildstein said he thought right away about Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who was being courted for a possible endorsement of the governor’s reelection campaign. “I noticed the traffic moving more quickly through those lanes, and I immediately thought this could be a potential leverage point with Mayor Sokolich down the road,” Wildstein said from the witness stand. He said he told his then-boss, Port Authority Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni, about what he saw and how the lanes could be used. Baroni was with him for the visit, he said. “Mr. Baroni responded that he saw what I saw and he understood — he agreed with me — that this was a potential leverage point,” Wildstein said. Wildstein later told Stepien, then a deputy chief of staff to the governor who ran the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. After Stepien left to run the governor’s campaign later that spring, Wildstein told his replacement, Bridget Anne Kelly, about the idea. Baroni and Kelly are both on trial for closing the lanes in what prosecutors say was an act of political retribution against Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie. Both were indicted last May on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations. Kelly emailed Wildstein on the morning of August 13 to say it was “time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.” Wildstein, who responded within a minute to say “got it,” said he immediately knew what she meant. “I understand that to mean that it was time to change the lane configuration at the upper level of the George Washington Bridge in order to create traffic in the borough of Fort lee,” Wildstein told jurors under questioning by prosecutor Lee Cortes. Wildstein said he spoke to Baroni that morning to say he heard from Kelly. He said they were both surprised she wanted to put the plan in place so late in the election season. “Mr. Baroni was a little surprised it was coming in this late,” Wildstein said. “He asked how I was going to do that. I told him I was going to think about it and we’d talk about it later.” Wildstein spoke to Kelly by phone at 5:48 p.m. that night. “She told me the reason was to send Mayor Sokolich as message,” he said as Kelly, sitting on the opposite side of the court room, looked down. “The indication was that mayor Sokolich needed to fully understand that life would be more difficult for him in the second Christie term than it had been in the first.” She later discussed with him that they wouldn’t have any communications with Fort Lee officials after the lane closures started, and that all complaints would be sent to Baroni’s office and not responded to. They called the approach “radio silence.” “The purpose was to create as big a traffic jam as possible,” Wildstein said. Wildstein said it was Baroni’s idea to close the lanes in September, not August. He said Baroni was concerned traffic might be much lighter with people on vacation and school out, and said Wildstein should figure out what day school started in Fort Lee. The answer, he informed Baroni, was Sept. 9. “He smiled and said, ‘fantastic,’” Wildstein said. Kelly also agreed, he said, and he went to work setting the scheme in motion. Wildstein continued to testify Monday afternoon and could be on the stand for several more days. Christie has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. But Wildstein’s attorney says there is evidence to prove the governor knew about the plot when it was occurring, and prosecutors on Monday endorsed that theory, saying the governor was told of the traffic gridlock and the mayor’s unanswered complaints on the third day of the lane closings. Kevin Marino, an attorney for Stepien, said his client has committed no wrongdoing and that that a 16-month investigation by prosecutors confirmed that. “Despite what Mr. Wildstein apparently feels compelled to say now, Mr. Stepien had no role in planning, approving or concealing his ill-advised scheme to close access lanes to the GWB,” Marino said in a statement on Monday afternoon. “To the contrary, as Mr. Wildstein has himself acknowledged, Mr. Stepien expressly advised him that Mr. Stepien was running a campaign; told him that he was not, and did not wish to be, involved in Port Authority business; and asked that Mr. Wildstein not involve him in such business. “Mr. Wildstein's sad and self-serving accusations from the witness stand may help him avoid prison for his admitted crimes, but they will not help the jury or the public learn the truth.” An internal investigation that was commissioned by the governor had found that Stepien misled Christie about what he knew about the lane closures, saying that Wildstein had approached him beforehand. The report has been widely discredited as a whitewash. Marino wrote a letter in 2014 saying that it wasn’t the case that he kept Christie in the dark about the contact, and that he had disclosed to the governor that Wildstein spoke to him. “There is no dispute that at that December 12, 2013, meeting, Mr. Stepien informed the governor that the proposed ‘lane realignment’ was one of Mr. Wildstein’s ‘50 crazy ideas,’” Marino wrote in the letter. Later in the day, Wildstein said that he told William “Pat” Schuber, a sitting member of the Port Authority's board, about the lane closures before they occurred. Wildstein said that he met with Schuber — a former Republican assemblyman and Bergen County executive — for breakfast on August 30, 2013, at the River Edge Diner. That was just 10 days before the closures began, and Wildstein said he’d already done much of the planning. An attorney for Schuber, Salvatore Alfano of Bloomfield, said Wildstein fabricated his testimony. NOTE: This article has been updated with the statement from Stepien's lawyer and with additional details of Wildstein's testimony. CORRECTION: This story initially stated that Wildstein visited the bridge and identified the lanes in 2013. It was 2011.",1,0,0
1115,"A liberal attempt to revive the so-called public option — a government-run insurance plan to shore up gaps in the Affordable Care Act — is opening old wounds between the Democratic Party’s liberal and moderate wings. Thirty-three mostly liberal Democrats, including all the Senate leadership, have signed onto a nonbinding Senate resolution introduced last Friday to add the public option to Obamacare, arguing that it is needed to fix problems with the president’s signature health care law. Story Continued Below But missing from the list are vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine and a half-dozen other moderates who face reelection in 2018 — when the map that favors Democrats this year will flip to favor Republicans. Kaine’s absence is especially striking since Hillary Clinton embraced the public option in July. A campaign spokesperson said Kaine is “supportive of a workable public option for health care insurance,” even though he has not co-sponsored the resolution. But other moderate Democratic senators made it clear that they remain uncomfortable with a government-run health program. Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate Montana Democrat up for reelection in 2018, said the focus should be on working “on a bipartisan basis to fix Obamacare.” “Until we get to the point that we’re willing to work together on that … we’re going to continue to see problems,” Tester said. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who won her 2012 election with 50.24 percent of the vote and is expected to face a tight race in 2018, called the public-option debate a “distraction.” “We’ve had a whole lot of discussion about what’s going to happen to Obamacare but … we aren’t having discussions [about how we deliver higher-quality care at lower costs] because we keep discussing how we’re going to fund it,” she said. The resistance of moderate Democrats led to the scuttling of the public option when it was first debated as a potential part of the ACA in 2009. Now, the continued divide between liberals and moderates could be a preview of coming battles if Clinton were to become president and liberals mounted a serious effort to add a public option to Obamacare. Since the ACA was conceived, liberals have insisted that a government-run health insurer would pressure private insurers to reduce premiums. Now, progressives say, many of the ACA’s flaws could be repaired with a public option, which would essentially be a new plan offered on the Obamacare insurance exchanges, some of which are down to only one or two private insurers. Clinton has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that she would “defend” the Affordable Care Act if elected president. Her campaign website pledges that she will “build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ‘public option’ possible.” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who is spearheading the effort, said that besides Clinton’s endorsement, rising premiums and the high-profile withdrawal of Aetna and United Healthcare from several exchanges makes the issue ripe for discussion. “We’re right in the middle of the presidential campaign, and I think it’s important during this campaign and [House and Senate races] to have a conversation about having competition in all the exchanges across the country,” Merkley said. He downplayed the lack of support from moderates and said he has not run the resolution by the Clinton campaign. He pointed out that all of the Democratic leaders have signed on as cosponsors. “So there is a wide range of folks — folks from states that have big insurance companies’ headquarters, like Connecticut — folks who don’t. It’s a broad spectrum,” he said. “We’re only a couple days into this.” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is championing the resolution, said the goal is to build momentum to enact a public option next year. Green said he’s happy with 33 co-sponsors so far and hopeful that moderate lawmakers from rural states are drawn to the idea of more competition among insurers. “Rural states have big problems with competition, and having a public option would actually be really popular in those states,” he said. But some red-state Democrats are skeptical. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who is also due to face voters in 2018, said she’s open to discussing the public option “but I want to make sure that we’ve done everything to make the market work before we turn to that.” Republicans are already trying to frame the public option as “more Obamacare,” a preview of the battle that could come if Democrats are in a position to pursue the proposal. “Democrats actually introduced legislation last week calling for Obamacare 2.0, a new government-run health plan,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. “And there are good reasons why so many of their own caucus won’t support it. It’s insulting to the millions of Americans who continue to watch their premiums spike — after Democrats said they’d be lower.”",1,0,0

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine. Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant. Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest. I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following.

753,"Liberals are constantly talking about how Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance. The reality is far more disturbing. Liberals also like to whine about how intolerant people are in regards to LGBT rights, yet they completely ignore where the real intolerance and oppression towards gay people lies. The Islamization of Europe is proving just how wrong liberals are on both counts. European liberals welcomed thousands upon thousands of Muslim refugees into their countries, and the results have been near catastrophic. Sharia law has been creeping across Europe, and for people who are hated by Islam, that’s truly worrying. A sad example is a despicable attack on a gay man in Brighton, England. On Sunday, Aaron Woods was walking down the street with his friend, Brian Markintosh. According to Markintosh, they were approached by a man who started screaming homophobic slurs at Woods. But it only got worse — the man then started physically attacking Woods, punching him in the face. Markintosh said the attacker “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.” He continued, “He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys.”  This wasn’t the first attack on gay people, either. Earlier this month, a similar attack took place, when a gay couple was attacked by two men. Is it merely a coincidence that the increase of Muslims in Europe has since an increase in homophobic attacks? The truth is that since the Muslim migrants have entered Europe, there has been a huge increase in crime. From attacks on gay people to sexual assault, Europe is in a bad spot right now. The homophobic attacks are easily explained: sharia law teaches that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death. ISIS, for example, is known to kill gay people in brutal ways, such as throwing them from the tops of buildings. It’s no surprise that an increase in Muslims would make Europe more dangerous for gay Europeans. The question is, will any liberals be honest enough to admit it? Or will they continue to deny the obvious and put people’s lives at risk? ",0,0,1
196,"Anyone with even a little bit of decency was outraged when GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump decided to tweet out an off the cuff invitation for Gennifer Flowers, the woman who was involved in an extramarital affair scandal with former President Bill Clinton in the 1980s, to be his guest at the first presidential debate. If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016  The tweet was just another example of Trump’s lashing out when he feels slighted. Well, it seems that the Trump campaign realized what a sleazy and inappropriate move this was on the part of their candidate, and campaign surrogates and officials have been out in force to make sure that the whole world knows that Trump will not have Flowers there as his guest. Trump campaign manager number three and official Trump whisperer Kellyane Conway said of the ruckus: “We do not expect her to be a guest of the Trump campaign.” Conway went on to spew the bullshit excuse that there’s no way that Hillary will ever get under Trump’s skin: “Mr. Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that make it into the head of Hillary Clinton.” The thing is, this is just disgusting. Hillary made the PERSONAL decision to stay with her husband, as many women do, after he had an affair. This nonsense is decades old, and should be in no way relevant to the 2016 race for the White House. This is something that is a low blow, sexist and is in no way appropriate for a serious political campaign. Trump’s flirting with this invitation for Flowers to attend the debate is nothing more than a misogynist attempt to shame a woman for her personal decision to forgive the man she loves for mistakes within a marriage. In other words, it’s not appropriate to drag it up, and it is none of the public’s business. Further, it CERTAINLY has NOTHING to do with the current election. This is just one more example of Trump’s grossly ill-suited temperament when it comes to occupying the highest office in this great land and leading the free world.

1529,"A pregnant southern California woman was allegedly brutally attacked by someone who responded to a fake ""rape fantasy"" ad on Craigslist created by her husband's ex-girlfriend.  Ontario-based Michelle Suzanne Hadley, 29, was apprehended and jailed July 18 on a $1 million bond.  Hadley dated a U.S. Marshals Service agent between 2013 and 2015. Prosecutors say Hadley placed ads posing as her ex-boyfriend’s new wife to lure men into sexually attacking the woman, who was pregnant with the couple’s first child, reports KCBS. Hadley gave the couple’s Anaheim address to men who responded to the ad on Craigslist, asking them to drop by when she knew the victim would be home alone. Numerous men showed up, one of whom assaulted the pregnant woman. Fortunately, she managed to call for assistance.  The suspect was previously accused of threatening the same woman and her unborn baby. Although the pregnant woman filed a restraining order against Hadley on June 6, Hadley violated the order by stalking the victim and was arrested June 24, according to the Daily Mail.  Hadley was released on $100,000 bail, but prosecutors say she continued sending threatening emails and responding to the ""rape fantasy"" ads on Craigslist. “Hadley is accused of telling the responders that the victim wanted the responders to have forcible sexual intercourse with her, even if she screamed or resisted,” the Orange County DA said in a statement. “Several of the responders showed up at Jane Doe's residence with the intention of raping the victim but did not succeed.  “One responder arrived at Jane Doe's residence and physically attacked the victim before she was able to call for help and the man fled the scene.” The jilted lover is charged with stalking, stalking despite a restraining order, assault with the intent to commit a sexual offense during a first-degree burglary, and making criminal threats, plus six counts of attempted forcible rape. Hadley’s arraignment is scheduled for August 19. If convicted, she could face seven years to life in prison.",0,0,1

579,"David Brock is the founder of the left-wing media “watchdog” Media Matters for America. It has a stated goal of “comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media.” Brock is also the head of super PAC in support of Hillary Clinton called Correct the Record. Like Media Matters, Correct the Record seeks to monitor all conservative news and coverage of Hillary Clinton and attempt to “debunk” any criticism of her. Since they’re also in the business of opposition research, they’re wanting to pay anyone to come forward with some embarrassing dirt on Donald Trump. As long as the dirt was “legally” obtained. They’re dubbing this project “TrumpLeaks.” The Washington Free Beacon reported: Brock asked for video or audio of Trump that has yet to be released. “One of the most important things for voters to evaluate in any election is the full measure of a candidate’s views, ideas, and temperament over time,” the website states. “In making a choice for president, voters must also consider how various candidates present themselves to the public and to the world. There are few things more important in that regard than access to video or audio in the form of prior television or radio interviews or more candid video from events a candidate may have attended.” Brock’s super PAC goes on to say they can offer compensation to anyone who has new video or audio that has been obtained legally. “TrumpLeaks is an effort to uncover unreported video or audio of Donald Trump so voters can have access to the Donald Trump who existed before running for president and before his recent affinity for teleprompters,” the website says of the project. “TrumpLeaks can provide some compensation to those who have usable, undoctored video or audio that has been legally obtained or is legally accessible.” NBC News noted that the project is “highly unusual” and seems to “cross a new line” in modern day politics. I think the only way in which this is “crossing a new line” is that they’re so out in the open about it. This is how they get dirt on opponents. It’s just that a candidate’s super PAC doesn’t usually make a public announcement about it. There’s got to be something out there that someone knows that will be damaging to Donald Trump. Everyone’s got skeletons in their closet. I imagine that “TrumpLeaks” will get a hold of it and wait until the most opportune time to release it. If for nothing else, it does show how desperate Hillary Clinton and her surrogates are in trying to make a comeback. It shows that they’re concerned that they’re not going to win.

157,"The Republican witch hunt to make the IRS commissioner pay for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after Democrats, insulted at having been dragged into this show trial, took the opportunity to instead flip the script. During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s hearing, Democrats began ignoring the “impeachment” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald Trump’s numerous tax scandals, including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud. Of particular interest was Trump’s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit. Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense. An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election. The head of the IRS – who presumably knows a thing or two about this – agreed. “Is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns, if they want to, because they’re under audit?” Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York asked. “No,” Koskinen responded simply. Another Democratic representative asked it another way. “Would releasing the person’s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return?” Rep. Ted Deutch asked. “The release itself wouldn’t. The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided,” Koskinen said. In other words, Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad, or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time. This answer actually confirms what Trump’s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad. It wasn’t the audit that scares Trump, it’s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what’s in them and that would destroy his father’s chances of becoming president. It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election. It won’t matter then. The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with “What have we done?” expressions painted on their faces. Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose, such as his actual income, what he pays the government in taxes, clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a U.S. rival. Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia, to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses. “Is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations?” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). The answer was no. Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles (a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr.’s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy). He later clarified that, unlike some people, he wouldn’t stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one. It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker. The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups. The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn’t seem to bother them. The impeachment hearing, widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show, came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP with yet another stark example for the American voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become. They settled for grandstanding. So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyone’s time, Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is.

243,"(CNN)Former President Bill Clinton sought to address concerns about his family's namesake foundation in an interview Monday, admitting that while ""it was natural"" for donors to seek favors from the Clintons, he'd ""trusted"" that the State Department under Hillary Clinton would appropriately handle potential conflicts of interest. ""It was natural for people who've been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn't do anything they shouldn't do,"" Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. He also maintained that he would sever his connection to the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton is elected president to remove any conflict-of-interest concerns, though he acknowledged the move would be ""hard."" ""It is hard, but you know, if Hillary is elected, I'm looking forward to it,"" Clinton said. He noted that he's worked for the foundation ""longer than I've ever had any job -- and I loved it."" ""And you know, we always say in response to our critics that nobody in my family ever took a penny out of this foundation and put millions of dollars in. But I would have paid more to do this job. It was the most fun thing I've ever done,"" Clinton added. The former president pushed back on criticism that donors to the Clintons Foundation engaged in a ""pay-to-play"" scheme, whereby donations to the foundation bought influence with Hillary Clinton during her term as Secretary of State. He pointed to the lack of evidence of any such quid-pro-quos, and accused critics of ""smearing"" him and his wife, according to NPR. ""In real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and I find out it is, I like you more and them less. In political life, they just keep on smearing you -- even if it all comes to nothing -- people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say.""

751,"Hillary Clinton has almost no ground game in Ohio. The video below shows what he found.  The Clinton campaign is reportedly formidable. Hillary Clinton brags about the number of employees work on the campaign. Then there are the volunteers. Most Americans know that Ohio is a critical state in the election. At one point it was reported that Clinton had over 681 paid staffers, and Trump only had 68. Given those numbers, the Clinton campaign certainly has the upper hand over Trump, right? Further, though Trump has beefed up his ground game nationally, Clinton has added to her staff. Latest numbers have the Clinton campaign now with over 1000 paid staffers. The Trump staffer had heard that there was a door knocking campaign, so he went down to check it out. There was an office with chairs set up for a conference style setup. The office had one guy. A bit of time passed, when a woman came out and introduced herself. Besides a few volunteers behind the counter, that describes the Clinton machine in that part of OH. When the Trump surrogate begins discussing the truth about the operation, they don’t take it too well. When you can count your volunteers on barely two hands, you have a problem. This certainly explains the “enthusiasm gap” that has Leftist media in a conniption. It further explains why Clinton can’t seal the deal. Latest polls have Trump either closing fast or taking the lead. His fundraising certainly proves there is more enthusiasm for Trump, than Clinton. ",0,0,1

580,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years. I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good. The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity: Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014. Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",0,0,1
35,"Neal West stood outside Bernie Sanders’ event at Kent State University on Saturday and asked people leaving to consider voting for the Green Party’s candidate, Jill Stein, though he knew full well that inside, the senator had repeated his call for his fans to vote for Clinton. West said that he voted for Sanders in the primary and that, in his opinion, Stein was closer to Sanders than Clinton on the issues. As he passed out flyers, he rejected the key argument from Sanders that in a battleground state like Ohio, where polls have the two major candidates neck and neck, he should vote for Clinton to stave off a Trump win. “If the Democratic Party had chosen a candidate that everybody would support, then there wouldn’t be an issue at all with Trump winning,” he said. Asked specifically if he worried about Trump winning, West went on: “That has nothing to do with me.” It remains to be seen whether Bernie Sanders, the choice candidate on many college campuses during the primary season, will be an effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton, who urgently needs the student and millennial vote. While stumping for Clinton at two universities in Ohio over the weekend, Sanders spent minimal time making a case for Clinton, but instead focused his remarks on why voters should reject her opponent. Sanders spoke passionately against Donald Trump. He accused the Republican Party nominee of rejecting science and trying to delegitimize Barack Obama’s presidency. “You want to disagree with Obama? Disagree with Obama. But do not go around putting a lot of money into trying to tell the American people that because we have an African American who happens to be president today that he is not a legitimate president,” the senator said while speaking at Akron University. “That is an awful and divisive and terrible thing to do.” But when talking about his former primary opponent, the Vermont senator primarily compared Clinton to Trump or listed ways in which she agrees with his own signature policy proposals on college affordability and health care. “Hillary Clinton and I believe that the time is now to ask the wealthiest people and the largest corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes,” he said during his swing through the battleground state. However, recent polling suggests that when it comes to winning the youth vote (a key demographic for President Obama) perhaps Clinton’s greatest challenge is not Trump, but other third-party candidates. In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, only 40 percent of adults under 30 years old backed Clinton in the general election -- a stark contrast from the 60 percent that Obama won in 2012. This is largely because one in three adults under 30 say they plan to vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein -- or not vote at all. But enthusiasm also matters: even months after the Democratic primary process wrapped up, 60 percent of Democratic adults under 30 say they wish that Bernie Sanders had won the nomination. In fact, only a quarter of them say they wanted Clinton to win the nod. During a listening tour across the state of Ohio, ABC News found that college students were much quicker to bring up the third-party options.     Before hitting the campaign trail again, Sanders specifically urged his supporters not to back third-party candidates. “Now is not the time to be supporting a protest vote,” he said during an interview on MSNBC. “Right now we have to make sure Trump does not become president and Clinton is the person to beat him.” During a campaign stop at Temple University on Tuesday, Clinton appealed to students who may still have reservations about her. “Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump you may still have some questions about me. I get that,” she said. “And I want to do my best to answer those questions.” While speaking on campuses, both Clinton and Sanders emphasized getting to the polls. Sanders told students they should not just vote, but volunteer and get involved with politics. “If we have a large voter turnout, for Secretary Clinton and Ted Strickland [the Democratic nominee for Senate in Ohio] here in Ohio and the entire nation will be very gratified for what you do,"" Sanders said.",1,0,0

""I think what we have to do is focus on the issues and not see tonight as an entertainment show,"" he told Burnett. Sanders said that he wants the debates to be more about the issues than about personalities. ""Let's talk about which candidate is going to be better for working families,"" he said. ""I believe that as a nation we have struggled as a long time to overcome bigotry and racism. Donald Trump is making the cornerstone of his campaign in fact bigotry."" ",1,0,0
829,"This actually happened in June, but is just as pertinent today, especially with 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees due to arrive in the US next weekend. Police in New Mexico pulled over a woman driving a vehicle. The drive was an undocumented Muslim woman from the Middle East… that’s bad enough, but what is even worse is what she had in her car. The woman had plans for a gas pipeline with her. This just screams ‘terrorism’. I have no idea why they pulled her over, but it was a very good thing they did. It has been widely reported that hundreds, if not thousands, of Islamic illegal immigrants are trying to get across our southern border. Judicial Watch released a report last summer saying that Mexican cartels are smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into the country. They furthermore released a second report just a few months ago saying that Islamic terror groups residing in Mexico have begun traveling to America in order to seek out potential targets. That border has now become a literal ticking time bomb of terrorism. It’s not ‘if’, it’s ‘when’ we get hit with a horrific terror attack that could kill thousands and it can all be laid at the feet of Barack Obama and the Marxists who are for open borders. They want America to be like Europe… Europe which is toast because of the Hijrah Migration and terrorism. No thanks. From Mad World News: Police in New Mexico recently pulled over a vehicle only to find that it was being driven by an undocumented, Middle Eastern woman. However, the situation got worse when they saw what she had in the car with her at the time – and now the surrounding area is on high alert. Judicial Watch indicates that a deputy sheriff in Luna County, New Mexico pulled over an unidentified “Islamic refugee” for an undisclosed reason. Luckily for everyone involved, the minor traffic infraction turned into so much more when the officer found plans for a gas pipeline in her possession. The pipeline is in Deming, New Mexico, and U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF) have been sent to the area to investigate. Unfortunately, the find could only be indicative of what is to come. Obama could bring in up to 250,000 Islamic refugees this next year. He is seeding them across America in conservative strongholds in an effort to change the voting demographic and terraform the US into an Islamic nation. Bringing in unvetted Islamists guarantees ISIS terrorists in their midst and Obama is good with that. What’s a few dead infidels to him? The plans this woman had in her possession include the region around the small town of Deming about 35 miles north of the Mexican border and 60 miles west of Las Cruces. Thanks to high unemployment, poverty, crime and a horrible public education system, Deming has been named No. 1 on a list of the “ten worst places” to live in New Mexico. The entire region is considered a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area due to large amounts of meth, heroin, cocaine and marijuana smuggled through the state by Mexican traffickers. The brutal Juárez and Sinaloa cartels operate in that area. The media has swept this under the rug, but it is a severe national security threat. This election may pivot on it, especially if we get hit. Our leaders owe it to their constituents to put our safety first, lock down that border and vet these refugees and illegal immigrants. Before we lose countless Americans to terrorism that is.  ",0,0,1

The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.” Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive. “If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.” And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice. “That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one.

Knight said Friday he's watched Trump's style evolve since he first endorsed Trump before the Indiana primary and that he has been strong. ""I just watch him, I think, become -- I don't know if the word 'mild' is the word to use or not, or 'milder.' But I just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and to go about attacking things and what's wrong,"" Knight said Friday on Fox. ""I've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way."" Knight is famous for coaching the Indiana Hoosiers and is one of the winningest college basketball coaches of all time. He endorsed Trump and campaigned with him before the candidate went on to the win the Indiana primary, effectively sealing his nomination. But Knight left coaching on controversial ground, after he as accused of physically and verbally abusing a student. Knight was legendary for his temper as much as his wins. Trump proudly touts the endorsement on the campaign trail, even when he is not appearing with Knight. ",1,0,0
1578,"Between the protests in Charlotte and athletes across the country refusing to stand for the National Anthem, the Black Lives Matter movement is getting a lot of attention. But not everyone is on board. Cleveland Cavaliers star Lebron James was giving a press conference, where he was asked for his opinion on athletes refusing to stand for the National Anthem in support of Black Lives Matter. And his response made liberals furious.   James began his statement by saying that while he respected Colin Kaepernick, he didn’t agree with the protest. “Me, standing for the national anthem is something I will do. That’s who I am,” he explained. “That’s what I believe in. But that doesn’t mean I don’t respect and don’t agree with what Colin Kaepernick is doing.” It was an exceedingly fair statement, but James wasn’t done yet. He continued, saying, “I’m not up here saying that all the police are bad, because they’re not. I’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not. But at the same time, all lives do matter. It’s not just about black or white, it’s everyone.”   Well, James did himself in there, because “all lives matter”? That phrase is unforgivable to liberals. And they quickly began not only attacking James for his statement, they even accused James — a black man — of racism. No, really:  Lebron James better sit for the anthem or he a Uncle Tom — Black skip baeless (@Rusjacksbrook) September 26, 2016  ""All Lives Matter"" is a dog whistle, a thing racists say that doesn't sound racist at 1st glance but clearly communicates a racist idea. — Jerry Topsider (@BostonJerry) September 26, 2016  You can't expect some of these so-call athletes to take a stand with their own people. Money is the power to keep them neutral #LeBronJames — Aaron SpiveySorrells (@aaronss101) September 26, 2016   But not everyone was quick to slam him. Some people wisely remembered that James is much more of a friend to the minority community than Black Lives Matter activists are:  LeBron James just donated $41.8M to the University of Akron in Ohio, giving 1,100 kids a full 4-yr scholarship but y'all calling him a coon. — NUFF$AID (@nuffsaidNY) September 26, 2016   The Black Lives Matter movement doesn’t do much to improve things for inner-city kids or the minority community. LeBron James does. But hey, keep smearing him as a racist Uncle Tom because he said something you don’t agree with. Great idea. ",0,0,1
416,"Washington (CNN)Presidential elections are a state-by-state battle. But in two instances this November, it could be district by district. Maine and Nebraska are the only two states in the nation that don't have a winner-take-all system for their Electoral College votes. That means that even if a candidate doesn't win the statewide popular vote in those states, they could pick up one or two Electoral College votes if they win in congressional districts. And with an increasingly close election, both Republicans and Democrats see an opportunity to add purple to the map. Brief civics lesson: You're not technically voting for president on Nov. 8; you're voting for electors. It's those people -- 538 of them -- who technically pick the president. There's a math equation used to calculate how many electors each state gets: three Electoral College votes based on the total number of US senators and US representatives it has (and three extras for the District of Columbia). While individual electors may technically cast those votes for whomever they choose, it is virtually unheard of for a candidate who wins the popular vote in a state to not get all the electoral votes, and many states have laws enforcing that electors must respect the statewide vote. Except, that is, in Maine and Nebraska, where things can get complicated. In those states, the votes are tallied by congressional district. The road to 270 In Maine, which has two senators, two congressmen and so four electoral votes, the statewide winner automatically gets two votes. And then the winner of each of the two congressional districts gets one electoral vote, respectively. In Nebraska, there are three congressional districts, meaning two votes go to a statewide winner and the three districts each award one electoral vote. So even if a candidate wins the majority of either state, Maine could have a 3-1 split and Nebraska could have a 4-1 or 3-2 split. This has almost never mattered -- but this year it might. If things get really close. They're not that close right now. Hillary Clinton has a strong advantage in the Electoral College. But CNN rates one congressional district each in normally red Nebraska and normally blue Maine as a ""battleground."" Maine has had the proportional system in place since 1972 and Nebraska since 1991, and only once have the votes ever split. Barack Obama in 2008 got one electoral vote from deep red Nebraska from the Omaha area. The President reflected on the unprecedented feat from 2008 while visiting Omaha in January. ""That year, in the primary, I won the Nebraska caucus, and there some people, I saw the signs calling the city 'Obamaha,' and then in November of 2008, Joe Biden and I won the electoral vote,"" Obama said during a trip to Nebraska. ""And then four years later I got whooped, all across this state."" Republicans in Nebraska have tried to change the law but failed by one vote this April to switch back to a winner-take-all. Both sides have their eyes on those single, accessible electoral votes. Trump has paid attention to and campaigned in Maine, a traditionally blue state in presidential years. He has reserved $47,000 in campaign ad time there from later this month through Election Day. Clinton, on the other hand, has paid attention to Nebraska, a traditionally red state in presidential years. She held an event with billionaire investor Warren Buffett in Omaha in early August, and has spent more than $500,000 on ads in the Omaha market. She has more than $120,000 reserved there through Election Day. Polls have tightened since early August, when Clinton had an advantage in many swing states that could have made for a landslide victory. Since then, races in many states have been toss-ups, making every electoral vote important. CNN's Gregory Wallace and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1219,"Donald Trump is a creature of television. And as a creature of television, he holds strong opinions about what ought to happen when he steps in front of the cameras. For the 2016 presidential debates, he’s weighed in with a variety of programming suggestions: A debate schedule that does not conflict with NFL games. Different moderators. Or no moderators at all: “I think that maybe we should just have no moderator. Let Hillary and I sit there and just debate,” he mused on CNBC’s “Squawkbox” earlier this month. Radical and unlikely as this last idea may seem, it also raises a fascinating question: Why have moderators at all? Why don’t we have debates where candidates just face off, one-on-one, without any questioners? Such a format could be a radical but useful break from the classic debate structures that have undergirded 50-plus years of presidential history. Story Continued Below Format shapes the outcome of debates far more than we realize. Some formats are relatively simple for candidates to maneuver, allowing strong candidates to game the system; others keep them more under control? Debates are certainly not “rigged,” but a standard two-podium format typically favors a very information-dense candidate like Hillary Clinton, while a town-hall format gives much more room for a big personality, like Trump, to dominate. For voters, too, different formats provide different kinds of information, from character to geniality to areas of expertise. The format Monday night is an extremely open one, borrowed from an idea debuted in 2012. Even without heeding Trump’s recommendation, the rules of engagement for this year’s presidential debates grant the candidates the power to conduct an essentially moderator-less exchange if they really want, allowing one or the other to grab the reins and seize control. On the one hand, this format would seem to benefit a loose performer like Trump, who is fully at home in the rough-and-tumble of live TV. On the other, long open exchanges could give Clinton a showcase to demonstrate her superior knowledge of policy and government. It might seem like a play for advantage, but Trump’s proposal for a debate without moderators is merely the latest entry in a long-running political conversation that has been underway since Lincoln met Douglas: what is the best way to design and execute a live campaign debate? It’s a surprisingly unsettled question after all these years—and might be poised for some radical changes. *** As both campaigns prepare for the showdown on Monday night, they should study the first debate from 2012, when Mitt Romney handed Barack Obama the most conclusive drubbing in a presidential debate since Richard Nixon sweated his way to defeat in 1960. The 2012 debates featured an innovation which, at the time, went nearly unremarked-upon in the press: long, open-ended discussion periods that, in effect, left it to the candidates to decide how the dialogue would unfold. Romney prepared specifically for these ground rules and took full advantage on debate night; Obama did not. And though much criticism was directed at moderator Jim Lehrer for approaching his task too passively, in fact, it was Obama’s rigidity in a malleable format that produced such a lopsided result. This exact same format will be used on Monday, as well as in the third debate, on October 19. Clinton and Trump will square off in six thematic blocks of 15 minutes apiece on subjects announced by the moderator in advance: This year, the topics will include “America’s Direction,” “Achieving Prosperity” and “Securing America.” Although the moderator is responsible for introducing topics and ensuring a more or less equal distribution of time, the debaters themselves determine how those 15-minute segments play out. As far back as 1960, debate producers had hoped to install a format that emphasized direct exchange between Kennedy and Nixon—the so-called Oxford-style debate—until campaign handlers vetoed the idea. What happened instead was three decades of a fairly rigid, controlled formula that often reduced the “debates” to parallel news conferences. “The panel's role was hardly more than to designate categories—animal, vegetable, or mineral—on which the two might or might not discourse,” complained one Kennedy-Nixon panelist afterward. Despite the limitations of journalistic panels, the format endured because it imbued the candidates with a sense of security—and kept them from having to confront each other directly. The first Carter-Ford debate in 1976, for instance, contained virtually no cross-talk by the candidates, who addressed each other only by talking to the moderators. Although change has come slowly to presidential debates, it has come. In 1988, for instance, moderators for the first time were allowed to ask an opening question. Everyone remembers Bernard Shaw’s hardball opening question to Michael Dukakis (“If Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered…”), but Shaw had a similarly gruesome set-up for George H.W. Bush (“If you are elected and die before Inauguration Day…”). The introduction of town hall debates in 1992 wrought a wholly new format, one that has bedeviled candidates ever since. The town hall can generate positive results—as in 1992 and 2004—or it can be dull and un-insightful—as in 1996 and 2008. It can also encourage candidate aggression, as in the 2012 match between Obama and Romney. Whatever the outcome, town hall is probably the least comfortable format for politicians because it is nearly impossible to game in advance. For that reason, campaign negotiators have imposed increasingly burdensome restrictions over the years on how the town hall functions. The once-freewheeling format of 1992 has been reined in considerably, in the vain hope of protecting the participants. The 1990s also marked the debut of solo moderators in place of panels, giving individual journalists an outsized role in setting the debate agenda. Jim Lehrer filled that slot for every presidential debate in 1996 and 2000; since 2004, each debate has been helmed by a different moderator. Another recent format innovation is the table debate, in which candidates and moderator sit at a table instead of standing at lecterns. Table debates can be more conversational than the more formal setup of lectern debates. Furthermore, by placing the debaters in close proximity, table debates encourage—at least in theory—a more civilized level of discourse. For Dick Cheney, table debates were also a practical necessity: with Cheney’s history of heart problems, his advisers did not want to risk having him stand for 90 minutes. What we’re going to see on Monday will be dramatic and is widely expected to be the most-watched debate in American history—and the format itself will be part of the reason why. Two drastically different personalities will, essentially, have six free-for-all segments to go at each other. The more polarized the electorate, the more valuable this kind of format is—it diminishes the role of moderators and panels, who voters increasingly distrust, and gives the candidates the opportunity to guide the conversation. Similar formats have been successful in countries like France and Spain—and the U.S., too. During the 1992 Democratic primaries, Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown appeared on an episode of Donahue in which host Phil Donahue did little more than introduce his guests and let them have at it; the result was a fascinating and unpredictable hour of television. We should be so lucky to have a similar debate on Monday night. *** In the elections to come, strange new debate experiments are in the offing. Producers of primary debates have experimented with the use of crowd-sourced topics, including questions submitted as YouTube videos or via Twitter. This past summer, party leaders in Australia held one of their national debates not on broadcast and cable TV but on Facebook Live. Technological advances promise to inject new life into what many critics see as a sclerotic institution. At their best, these innovations might hold candidates accountable by tapping into real-time voter reactions and concerns. At worst, an excess of experimentation might reduce presidential debates to high-stakes video games. One novel proposal comes from New America senior fellow Lee Drutman, who suggests that we ought to end debates as we know them, and replace them with a crisis-situation simulator: “Film crews could record the entire simulation, then television producers could turn it into a reality-TV special.” Perhaps the candidates can be administered the kobayashi maru; that, too, would receive high ratings. Still, without any of that high-tech sizzle, Monday night will be must-see TV for any voting-age American. It will simply be two candidates on a stage with one moderator, but likely to be more freewheeling than we’d imagine.",1,0,0

16,"In this final stretch before Election Day, the Clinton camp is setting its sights on the youth. The Democratic presidential nominee today held a millennial-focused campaign event at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she made her pitch to the voting bloc that has been unwilling to fully rally behind her. ""Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that,"" Clinton, in a moment of self-reflection, told the crowd of 300 people. ""And I want to do my best to answer those questions.” She explained that the “service” part of “public service” has always been easier for her than the “public” part. “I will never be the showman my opponent is and, you know what, that's OK with me,” she said, referring to Donald Trump.       Over the past week, the Clinton campaign has redoubled its efforts to attract millennials, whom demographers define loosely as people born in the early-1980s through the early-2000s. Clinton surrogates President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all been tapped to hit the trail. The main focus: urging young people to vote. “We need everyone off the sidelines,” Clinton said today. “Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump’s hands, it really does.” Clinton, who started her remarks calling on the country to “remain vigilant” in the wake of the bombings in New York and New Jersey, also used the opportunity to contrast herself with her Republican opponent. ""You want something to vote for, not just against,"" she told the crowd. “Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. “You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality-TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name calling or stunts to get on the cable news,” she added, referencing Trump’s long-held and false belief that Obama was born outside the United States. “This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America,” she concluded. Trump has since said that he believes Obama was born in the United States. Although Clinton is polling better with young adults than Trump (a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that she has 40 percent support among youth versus Trump’s 28 percent), the demographic, as a whole, has shown less enthusiasm for her candidacy than other Democrats. According to that same poll, 60 percent of Democratic adults under the age of 30 said they had hoped Sanders would win their party’s nomination, while 26 percent said Clinton. That number, however, is better than it was four months ago. (During the primary in spring, 75 percent of Democrats under the age of 30 supported Sanders, while only 25 percent said they supported Clinton, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll.) Clinton campaign officials, who hope to close that gap further, say they plan to continue these outreach efforts throughout the rest of the campaign. ""The millennial generation is a key voting bloc in this election and it's clear that the campaign must do more to earn their vote,” Clinton spokesman Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement today. “That is why the campaign has recently ramped up efforts to engage millennial voters through a stretch of events with surrogates like President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Senator Tim Kaine, Anne Holton, Chelsea Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. “The campaign has also brought on board staff at headquarters and in states to organize and mobilize millennial voters,” she added. “And over the coming weeks, the campaign will continue to host discussions in communities on how Hillary Clinton is fighting for them.” ABC News’ Ryan Struyk contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1119,"Nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the Confederate monument on the front lawn of the Franklin County Courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back. The rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people—women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. “We’re very proud of it,” says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. “This whole county’s very, very patriotic.” Story Continued Below This was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone—history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades. But for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina’s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments—223—than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the “New South” and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it’s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state. Though a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor’s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia’s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion—known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy—Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them. That ruling—along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state—prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. “If you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you’re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country—to learn the good, the bad and ugly,” Poindexter says. Many of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out. “Every little statue’s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,” says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. “African-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they’re using it for.” *** Mark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. “My ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,” Whitaker says. Now, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. “These monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,” he says. Many of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town. But even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth’s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. “We believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,” Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so “there has been protection all along.” When the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case. Back in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don’t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument—a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. “Why now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we’re concerned about cost?” He says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. “We’re on solid legal grounds to remove it,” he says. “We just need four votes.” *** Other Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city’s entire historic landscape. He asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville “by telling the full story of race through our public spaces.” The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December. In the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site—the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down. Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It’s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled “Black Lives Matter” on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments’ removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders—such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. “Rather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia’s history,” Jones said in a statement last summer. Delegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he’s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, “It’s far better than tearing down the current ones.” In his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is “irrelevant.” “They need to be respected,” he says. “They didn’t know what we know today. That’s why these monuments are important.” Ayers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. “The white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,” he says. “They’ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It’s an amalgam of power and weakness.” “They’re meant to do work,” Ayers says. “The work that they were meant to do, in some ways they’re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.” *** In Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls “The War Between the States.” Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910. One of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, “we just don’t have a copy of the actual check.” Poindexter says Franklin County “lost hundreds of its best men” in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was “a horrible process” that had a big impact on the region. Today, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state’s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter’s efforts to save war monuments. “We didn’t want anybody pulling any monuments down,” Stanley says. Soon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county’s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it. Civil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia’s Blue Ridge. “To be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.” Yet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society’s website, “Special emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.” Confederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he’s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. “He became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,” says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace. Speaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn’t ready to surrender, either. He doesn’t know whether he’ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn’t ruled it out. “If you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?” he says. “You can’t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.”",1,0,0
1081,"Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, on Wednesday blasted Donald Trump’s statements about the state of the black community and America’s inner cities. “I don’t know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it’s ever been,” the Georgia Democrat said when asked by MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell about Trump’s comments. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn’t take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?” Story Continued Below Lewis was responding to comments Trump made during a campaign event Tuesday in North Carolina. “We’re going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they’ve ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,” Trump said. It’s part of a broader case Trump has been making to black voters, arguing that their situation is dire due to Democratic policies and that they should vote for Republicans because their circumstances could not be worse. A surrogate for the New York businessman's campaign said Trump was not suggesting that African-Americans are worse off now than under Jim Crow segregation. ""I don't think he's talking about the days of Jim Crow, even the days of the civil rights movement of the '60s and obviously not slavery. But he's saying the African-American community is at times being outpaced by other communities,"" Joseph Borelli, a New York City council member, told CNN on Wednesday. Lewis wasn't the only prominent member of the African-American community to harshly criticize Trump's comments Wednesday. Cornell William Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, ripped Trump on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" for ignoring in his comments racial injustices from the slavery and Jim Crow eras. “For anyone to assert that the African-American community is in the worst shape ever, ever, ever … is to demonstrate an insulting degree of ignorance and insensitivity,” he said. “We expect more from our presidential candidates.” Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1477,"Rioters have taken over Charlotte, North Carolina. The situation has become so bad that Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard. One person isn’t having it though and that’s Sheriff David Clarke. Nicknamed “America’s Sheriff,” Clarke is known for his commonsense approach to controversial issues and his politically incorrect devotion to telling it like it is. Sheriff Clarke was on Stuart Varney’s show on the Fox Business Network and weighed in on the riots in Charlotte, and he hit the nail right on the head. Clarke completely rejected the idea that the rioters were actually protesters trying to combat racial injustice. “This has become a political construct and I said that four months in December of 2014 after Ferguson,” Clarke said. “I know these people, I know what they’re up to, I know their mode. These are anarchists! The anarchists are exploiting these poor people in these urban ghettos to be the riot starters so until the police commanders start to understand what this movement is – all they have to do is go back to the war on cops in the 60’s.”  Riots in Charlotte. @SheriffClarke: these are anarchists… a soft approach from police just won't work. #VarneyCo pic.twitter.com/brFSeCOH4B — Varney & Co. (@Varneyco) September 21, 2016   He also called on police to stop handling these rioters with kid gloves. According to Clarke, police must act more aggressively to stop the violent activists before it gets out of control. And the situation in Charlotte is truly out of control. In addition to blocking highways and looting businesses, the rioters have turned violent. They were smashing windows and setting fire to businesses. At least one person has been killed and multiple police officers have been injured. They even began attacking the media, which has largely been sympathetic to their cause. A CNN reporter was body-slammed live on air and the rioters tried to kill a photographer by throwing him into a fire. But the violence didn’t end there. After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants. This is not about protesting the death of an allegedly innocent person. This is a bunch of thugs exploiting someone’s death for their own nefarious purposes. ",0,0,1

941,"The archconservative Arizona Republic newspaper in Phoenix has endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the first presidential debate. If there were questions this summer that Arizona has become a swing state, this surprising answer puts a must win state for Republicans – which has been solidly red since becoming a state – into play for Democrats in 2016. Arizona’s largest media outlet has never picked a Democrat for President since 1890. Not only did the Republic endorse Clinton because Trump is unfit for office, but their 1400 word endorsement is lengthy, absolutely comprehensive, filled with videos and even rejects the Republican embrace of racist immigration politics for the Democratic Party’s inclusive recipes to move America forward: The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president. America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class. This is Hillary Clinton’s opportunity. She can reach out to those who feel left behind. She can make it clear that America sees them and will address their concerns. She can move us beyond rancor and incivility. As secretary of state, Clinton made gender equality a priority for U.S. foreign policy. This is an extension of Clinton’s bold “women’s rights are human rights” speech in 1995. It reflects an understanding that America’s commitment to human rights is a critically needed beacon in today’s troubled world. Clinton retains her composure under pressure. She’s tough. She doesn’t back down. Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads. That’s beneath our national dignity. When the president of the United States speaks, the world expects substance. Not a blistering tweet. In fact, the Arizona Republic published such a lengthy editorial board statement that it’s easier to summarize their section headers, because these eight points made by the conservative newspaper answer many of the media’s lingering questions about both candidates. The Republic reserved its harshest criticism for Trump’s misadventure to Mexico City, then paired with an immigration speech in Phoenix. The Republican’s gamble failed, and the trip to our southern neighbor mushroomed into an international incident, spurring legislation which will prevent Mexico from ever paying for a border wall. Even worse for Trump, the Arizona Republic’s unequivocal slam dunk of his mindless harsh immigration policies is a massive failure in the border state whose notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio is the most racist lawman in America. Phoenix has voted the racist birther – who refuses to give up the witch hunt of President Obama like Trump claimed he would – into office since 1993, and it’s a place who prefers the most extreme solutions to immigration and loves racial profiling in law enforcement. The Republic roundly condemned Republican tropes demonizing Latinos in general and Mexicans in particular: Contrast Clinton’s tenacity and professionalism with Trump, who began his campaign with gross generalities about Mexico and Mexicans as criminals and rapists. These were careless slaps at a valued trading partner and Arizona’s neighbor. They were thoughtless insults about people whose labor and energy enrich our country. Trump demonstrated his clumsiness on the world stage by making nice with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto only a few hours before appearing in Phoenix to deliver yet another rant about Mexican immigrants and border walls. What’s more, Arizona went down the hardline immigration road Trump travels. It led our state to SB 1070, the 2010 “show me your papers” law that earned Arizona international condemnation and did nothing to resolve real problems with undocumented immigration. Arizona understands that we don’t need a repeat of that divisive, unproductive fiasco on the national level. A recent poll shows Arizonans oppose both more walls and the mass deportations Trump endorses. We need a president who can broker solutions. There’s just a certain segment of American voters who will never ever change their minds based on facts, and so they’ll continue to vote Trump. But independent and undecided voters can trust the numerous factual reasons issued from sources like the Arizona Republic, who have no incentive to be nice to Hillary Clinton or institutional preference for Democrats. If Hillary Clinton can win over so many Republicans with her leadership qualities and competent preparation for the job of President, the choice to vote for the Democratic nominee for America’s independent voters should be clear this November.",0,1,0
471,"Washington (CNN)The Washington Monument will remain closed indefinitely, the National Park Service announced Monday, following ongoing elevator issues. ""The scope of work to be accomplished while the monument is closed and the duration of the closure are still being determined; we expect to have an announcement with those additional details in the next couple of weeks,"" the National Park Service said in a statement. Repairs were expected to be over by mid-September. However, determining the reasons for the elevator issues has taken longer than expected, National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst told CNN on Monday. ""Basically, we've had to make the difficult decision to keep the monument closed until the modernization work on the elevator is completed,"" Litterst said, characterizing the move as a ""long-term"" closure. The monument was shut down in mid-August when a cable broke lose in the elevator that takes visitors on a 555-foot ride up the structure to take in sky-high views of the nation's capital. Litterst said that although National Park Service officials previously considered the theory that a 2011 earthquake could have contributed to the elevator problems, a third-party inspector didn't ""see any evidence"" that the earthquake is a factor. A block-by-block inspection of the monument began in August 2011, after the structure experienced ground motion from the 2011 earthquake that struck the neighboring state of Virginia. ",1,0,0
1623,"The shooter responsible for injuring nine people during a mass shooting in Houston on Monday was wearing Nazi paraphernalia, according to the Houston Police Department. Two sources from within law enforcement have confirmed to  that the body of the shooter – who was fatally shot by police during the shootings – was wearing a World War II German uniform covered in swastikas. While his name has yet to be officially confirmed by police, media outlets have discovered that the shooter’s vehicle was owned by a 46-year-old attorney by the name of Nathan Desai. Two of his nine victims are listed as being in critical condition, and six of the remaining seven have been released from the hospital. Desai was a lawyer who practiced in Houston who had recently fallen into hard times financially. “He was worried … because his law practice was not running good, so he (was) worried about this all the time,” the Desai’s Father said. Additional Nazi paraphernalia as well as extra weapons were also found in his car and residence. Houston Police have not yet given an official ruling about whether the shooting will be labelled as an act of terrorism.        ",0,1,0
897,"The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career: Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.” Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter. In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right! But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill: Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.” Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief. American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.",0,1,0
1186,"Utah Sen. Mike Lee on Friday swiftly shot down the idea that he would accept a nomination to the Supreme Court from Donald Trump. ""Sen Lee already has the job he wants which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of Utah again this year,"" Lee spokesman Conn Carroll said in response to POLITICO, after NBC News reported on a new list of potential Supreme Court nominees that Trump would propose as president. Story Continued Below Lee is one of 10 on the expanded list, which also includes Neil Gorsuch, a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; Margaret A. Ryan, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; Edward Mansfield, an Iowa Supreme Court justice; Keith Blackwell, a Georgia Supreme Court justice; Charles Canady, a Florida Supreme Court justice; Timothy Tymkovich, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; Amul Thapar, a U.S. District Court judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Federico Moreno, a U.S. District Court judge for the Southern District of Florida; and Robert Young, the chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Trump’s decision earned praise from Judicial Crisis Network Director Carrie Severino, who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. “Donald Trump continues to take unprecedented steps to demonstrate that he intends to appoint justices like Scalia, Thomas and Alito,” Severino said in a statement. “Conservatives should be very pleased by the steps he has taken, and if he lives up to his promises we will have a Court that truly puts the rule of law ahead of political preferences.” Lee has refused to endorse Trump for president, although he did offer praise for Trump's first list of potential justices unveiled in May, which included his brother Thomas, a Utah Supreme Court justice. ""It wasn't just that there were some great names on that list, that was the best, most conservative Supreme Court shortlist I've ever seen,"" Lee said at the time. ""And I was thrilled by that.""

1171,"Democrats are confident the rising salience of terrorism and police shootings of African-Americans this week will benefit Hillary Clinton. Republicans, meanwhile, believe overwhelmingly that Donald Trump will win the terrorism argument but are less confident that he'll react in a measured way to the recent protests in North Carolina. That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. More than three-in-four Democratic insiders believe Clinton will benefit from the increasing prominence of both issues. And while majorities of Republicans, on the other hand, think both issues will help Trump, there’s less confidence that he can strike the right balance between law enforcement and the aggrieved African-American community. Story Continued Below On terrorism and national security, the results were fell along party lines: 76 percent of Democrats said Clinton stands to benefit from the issue, compared to 81 percent of Republicans who said it would help Trump. That mirrors public polling that shows voters divided on which candidate they trust more on the issue — with a slight edge for Clinton, particularly on temperament and ability to be commander-in-chief. “Polls show that folks do not trust Trump to have his finger on the button,” said one Wisconsin Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “That to me says it all.” A Pennsylvania Democrat added that Trump’s criticism of military leadership for their prosecution of the overseas battle against the Islamic State has alienated key voters in their state. “Trump's open disrespect of the military doesn't play well among the same base he's supposed to be courting — the disaffected Western [Pennsylvania] voters,” the Democrat said. But some Democrats are concerned that rising anxieties about terrorism — if they were to persist for the next six-and-a-half weeks — could benefit Trump. “We have an older electorate, plus still some conservative white Democrats,” said a Florida Democrat. “In a close race, fear can win out.” Republicans, meanwhile, said Trump can effectively tie Clinton to President Barack Obama — who, despite rising approval ratings overall, rates poorly on his handling of national security. “People who are angry and afraid feel that way because of the Obama-Clinton policies that created [ISIL] and allowed the wave of domestic terror to occur largely unchecked,” said an Ohio Republican. “She's counting on ‘experience’ and ‘being there in the situation room,’” said a Michigan Republican. “I think that works against her and solidifies that she's part of the problem.” On the other burgeoning issue this week — the police-involved shootings in Tulsa, Okla., and Charlotte, N.C. — majorities of Democrats again defaulted to their partisan leanings. But Republicans were less certain the issue would help Trump — only 61 percent said it would — compared to the larger majority that said it would benefit Clinton, 77 percent. (Reponses were filed between 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, prior to the beginning of a second night of rioting in Charlotte, and 2 p.m. Thursday.) Democrats mostly said the issue allowed Clinton to strengthen her appeal to minority voters — and, potentially, for Trump to repel nonwhite voters further. “The voters who are young, who are people of color, and who are most sympathetic to the injustice of police shootings are more liberal, but inconsistent voters,” said a Michigan Democrat. “This increased attention, if it has any impact, will boost their participation, and they are more likely to vote for Clinton.” Added a Florida Democrat: “If Clinton can get black turnout as a share of electorate to Obama levels, in addition to her Hispanic advantages, she can lose a bit of white support and win.” But some Democrats worried about a backlash among white voters to the at-times-violent protests. “Pictures of black youth burning things in the middle of Interstate 85 in Charlotte last night did nothing but help Trump,” said a North Carolina Democrat. “With more demonstrations planned for tonight, this issue could even surpass the HB2 fiasco as the defining issue in the campaign for North Carolina voters.” Most Republicans see the issue as an opportunity for Trump to burnish his law-and-order credentials. “People believe Obama has created an anti-police attitude in this country, and many will punish Hillary Clinton for that,” a Florida Republican said. And the demographic reality of the battleground states — many of them, like Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire have smaller African-American populations — means a backlash among white voters in those states could tilt toward Trump. A Colorado Democrat said the African-American vote there was “small and already locked in.” “Iowa is 93 percent white, and [Black Lives Matter] protests are more galvanizing for downscale white voters than urban liberals,” said a Republican there. “And those rural white voters outnumber urban liberals by a lot, many of them former working class Democrats who are attracted to nationalist, anti-PC rhetoric.” “There are way more ‘Blue Lives’ than ‘Black Lives’ Matter folks in Iowa,” added another Republican there. “Trump will clean up.” But some Republicans in more diverse states said the issue could motivate some members of the Obama coalition who haven’t been enthusiastic about Clinton. “[T]o the extent it may generate increased interest in public policy and the election in her base, that would be a good thing for her,” said a Virginia Republican. “Hillary's base is there, but they aren't motivated or excited.” Added an Ohio Republican: “Hillary has to ignite the black community. I expect the Obamas to camp out in the cities. This unrest could become a focal point for her.” And for other Republicans, they questioned Trump's ability to address these issues in a measured way. ""Trump is antagonistic and demeaning, and his ideology on racial issues/police shootings is embarrassing,"" said a Colorado Republican. A New Hampshire Republican put it even more sharply: ""No matter how hard he tries, Trump is incapable of hiding his racism."" But with the demographic push-and-pull between groups concerned in equal measure about the police shootings and the subsequent protests, others saw the issue as a wash between the two candidates. “I think it helps them both equally,” said a Michigan Republican. “Hillary needs minority turnout to go up, and this certainly helps there. Trump needs disaffected, law-and-order, white voters to turn out — this helps him with that.” These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey: Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer Florida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

944,"The United States made at least two separate payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer within the last 14 months, a Treasury Department spokesman confirmed Saturday, contradicting explanations from President Barack Obama that such payments were impossible. Responding to questions at an Aug. 4 press conference about a $400 million payment delivered in cash to the Iranian government, Obama said, “[T]he reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.” Story Continued Below But a Treasury Department spokesman acknowledged on Saturday that on at least two occasions, the U.S. did make payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer. In July 2015, the same month in which the U.S., Iran and other countries announced a landmark nuclear agreement, the U.S. government paid the Islamic republic approximately $848,000. That payment settled a claim over architectural drawings and fossils that are now housed in the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and Iran’s Ministry of Environment, respectively. Then, in April 2016, the U.S. wired Iran approximately $9 million to remove 32 metric tons of its heavy water, which is used to produce plutonium and can aid in the making of nuclear weapons. While some sanctions relating to Iran’s nuclear program were lifted with the implementation of the nuclear agreement, others imposed over the Islamic Republic’s human rights policies and support for terrorist organizations remain in effect. The July 2015 wire transfer was made while the full weight of sanctions against Iran were intact, while the April 2016 payment for heavy water was made after the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. The Treasury Department spokesman explained that the lifting of those sanctions allowed Iran “to gain incremental access to the international financial system, which opened up more options for executing transactions, such as the heavy water transaction” that occurred in April 2016. The spokesman declined to offer an explanation as to why the July 2015 payment was possible despite the full array of sanctions in place at the time. That $400 million cash payment that Obama said could not have been delivered any other way was part of a larger $1.7 billion settlement with Iran, the remainder of which was also delivered in cash. The $400 million, paid in January to settle a decades-old dispute over military equipment order by the late shah of Iran, was sent through intermediary central banks in Europe, who then delivered pallets of euros, Swiss francs and other currencies to Tehran. The Treasury Department spokesman said that the January settlement specified that payment be made in cash because Iran had previously had difficulty accessing wire-transferred funds and was “very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using the funds from the January 2016 settlement payment if they were in any other form than cash.” A senior Obama administration official contested that the Treasury Department’s confirmation of the twin wire transfers contradicted what the president said at his press conference early last month. The official repeated what the president said at the time, that “we do not have a direct banking relationship with Iran, which means that we cannot wire money directly to Iran,” but did not directly address either the July 2015 or April 2016 wire transfers. “Sanctions had effectively cut off Iran from the international financial system and after several years of trying to gain limited access to its own money held in accounts outside of Iran, Iran was very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using these funds if they were in any form other than cash,” the official said of negotiations surrounding the $1.7 billion settlement. “Therefore, effectuating the payment in foreign currency banknotes was the most reliable way to ensure that they would receive the funds in a timely manner.” Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have alleged that Iran requested a cash payment specifically because it would make the money difficult to trace. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump made an issue of the cash payment over the summer, suggesting that the cash delivery likely wound up funding terrorism or found its way into ""some of the mullahs' bank accounts."" Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who discovered the two wire transfer payments in briefings with Obama administration officials, echoed those concerns in an interview with POLITICO on Thursday. “Oh, I don’t have any question that Iran wants the money in cash because they wanted it faster than what a wire transfer would be and it’s fungible,” Lankford said. “They announced pretty quickly afterward that they were expanding their defense and their military budget by $1.7 billion dollars, an exact amount that we had just sent over to them. So I don’t think that was accidental.” “But when you give cash, we can’t track,” he continued. “Did that go to Hezbollah? Did that go to the Russians? Did that go to the coup in Yemen? There’s no way to be able to track that.” Republicans, including Lankford, have also suggested that the $1.7 billion delivery constituted a “ransom” payment because it was delivered on the same day that U.S. prisoners were released by Iran. The president dismissed such claims during his Aug. 4 press conference as “the manufacturing of outrage” and said unequivocally, ""we don’t pay ransom for hostages.” But State Department spokesman John Kirby acknowledged two weeks later that the U.S. had refused to deliver the cash to Iran until its prisoners were wheels up from Tehran, a decision Kirby said the U.S. made to “retain maximum leverage” over the Iranians. Despite that admission, he maintained that the arrangement did not in any way constitute a ransom payment.",1,0,0
689,"UPDATE: It just keeps getting better. Keith Lamont Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, said the man was reading…the Koran before he was shot. Ya can’t make this stuff up folks! Why isn’t the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chief of Police, Kerr Putney, going to release the video of the altercation between police and Keith Lamont Scott? According to the chief, it is clear that Scott had a gun. But then he back tracked saying: “The video does not give me absolute, definitive, visual evidence that would confirm that a person is holding a gun.” So what does that mean? From his declaration, there is but one conclusion we can make in confidence – that Scott did in fact have a handgun. Evidently other evidence and witness accounts support the police narrative that officers opened fire only after Scott refused to drop his weapon, so he did in fact have a weapon. It was neither holstered nor in his waistband. He was in fact holding the weapon. It was not a book he was holding as “witnesses and family” have claimed. Therefore, since the weapon was drawn, Scott must have intended to use it. Yet leftist websites and news outlets like the Huffington Post, drew a different conclusion from chief Putney’s statement. They claim that, “He [Putney] did however, note that the video fails to establish that Scott was holding a gun when he was shot.” This is absolutely NOT what the Chief said. Putney obviously chose his words very carefully. We don’t know why – just that he did. Watching the video of that segment of the press conference, adds further context to his statement.

1392,"The problems surrounding the Clinton Foundation continue to worsen. We know that over half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state (85 of 154 people) were with individuals who either donated to her slush fund or pledged to support one of its international programs. We know the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from sketchy foreign entities. We know half of the staffers paid under the GSA program also worked for the Clinton Foundation. We know Hillary’s former chief of staff at the State Department, Cheryl Mills, also worked for the Clinton Foundation while working for the State. We know the Clinton Foundation spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants in 2013.  The Clinton Foundation claims that “88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work,” but one has to wonder. How does spending $8.5 million (or 10% of the budget) on travel– plane tickets, hotel accommodations, etc.– change lives? Heck, $4.8 million (or 5.6 percent) of the 2013 budget went toward office supplies. Dead serious. Blank paper and staplers are pricey, I guess. Call it “overhead” all you want, but it’s absurd. Just take a deeper look. If you didn’t think it could get any worse, I’m sorry. You’re wrong. In 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation’s budget went to charitable grants. Everything else covered staff salaries, travel and other benefits. The organization’s IRS filings revealed that it spend just short of  $91.3 million in 2014. Of that, $5.2 million went to charity. Around $34.8 million went toward staff salaries and benefits, and $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses.” Oh. And $851,000 was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Fundraising can be expensive. Hillary knows all about that. Basically, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 but somehow managed to increase employee compensation and “other expenses” by $5 million each. The Clintons are super charitable though. They donated over $1 million to charity last year! Who cares if $1 million went to their personal slush fund? They are so compassionate. Just kidding. Vice President Joe Biden can’t even get himself to say that the Clinton Foundation is ethical. h/t Daily Caller",0,0,1
1399,"Caitlyn Jenner has been all over the spectrum the last few months. He even admitted to contemplating suicide. Caitlyn said he was not gay, but straight woman aren’t interested (anymore), he’s confused, he’s got buyer’s remorse on the surgery. His show is canceled. Where does he go from here? Life just hasn’t been greener on the other side for Bruce..Caitlyn…whoever he is today!    US Magazine Reports: “The 66-year-old I Am Cait star — formerly known as Bruce — told Simmons, 46, that she thought about taking her own life shortly after having her Adam’s apple surgically shaved, a part of her body she “always hated.” When a paparazzo captured shots of Jenner leaving the doctor’s office after the procedure in February 2014, the former Olympian said she nearly lost it. “I could not sleep that night. I’m up at 3 a.m. walking up and down my hallway, thinking, Damn, all this s–t is going to come out tomorrow and it’s going to be horrible,” she recounted. “And I said, ‘You know what? Easy way. Go in the other room. You got a gun. Let’s just end it right here.’” The TV personality — who has been open about her brush with suicide with friends and family — added that the whole experience was one of the worst moments in her life.”    It is not a rarity. David Batty in the UK Guardian wrote: A review of more than 100 international medical studies of “post-operative” transsexuals finds up to 20% regret transitioning and no conclusive evidence was found that shows gender reassignment surgery improves the lives of transsexuals, with many people remaining severely distressed and even suicidal after the operation. A staggering 41 percent of transgender people in the United States have attempted to commit suicide. 65 percent of people who’ve had cosmetic surgery, which is relatively minor body alteration, later regret the decision. So it is no wonder that Caitlyn is in this huge state of confusion.   ",0,0,1

He is the only one who has taken our side and we are lucky he has. He knows all of the elite-businessmen’s dirty tricks, inside out. No businessman can buy him. When the people started the move, he stood up, and took the huge job on his back. He rolled up his sleeves and he is ready to lead. Can he get us what we hope? The stronger we support him the stronger he is. Let me tell you something Mr. and Mrs. elite- businessmen of the United States of America. You are lucky dogs that we have elections, a peaceful way to change, or we would have shown you what you hate. Now America, would you unite behind Trump? This issue is far beyond the republican nomination. Now to the elite-businessmen, would you have it the easy way and accept to deal with our negotiator, or would you prefer to deal with us hand to hand. Why Trump? First, he is the only one who cares for the main issues and offers decisive solutions to them. The other candidates avoid these problems. They follow the rules of the elite-businessmen so that they survive and keep their “jobs”, full-time politicians working for the elite-businessmen. Other than his personal characters, we mentioned before: He is an Insider. He knows who is who in that society of elite-businessmen. He knows what is going on and where are the problems. A strong man and a manager: In such broken system, you need someone who can impose leadership on others. Someone who can redefine and distribute the responsibilities to put a new functioning system in place. A manager knows how to make everyone work. He would make the businessman do his job that he is supposed to do for the country. I, personally have enough knowledge to rule a country, but I would not be able to make everyone do his job, not only do it, but do it as it should be done. A strong man, a businessman and a negotiator: He will negotiate on our behalf. He would not let a businessman sell our government what we don’t need. He would not let the businessman sell our army a $600 dollar toilet seat. He would not let the hospital sell $60.00 Jell-O and $100.00 pill of medicine knowing that the insurance companies would collect the money from us. A strong man and a builder: His job is construction which means that he builds. He oversees everything. He makes everyone do his work. He finishes what he starts then he stands with pride looking at the huge beautiful building he constructed. A builder does not know a half done job, he knows only the well fully completed job. Let me call on you America, all of you America, all the races, all the religions, all the ideologies and all the socio-economic classes; vote for your leader Donald J. Trump. How about the other candidates? They are playing the election game. The elite- businessmen want to see a well tamed candidate from each political color. They want to make sure that the American people are well distracted from their serious problems in ideological confrontation that avoids serious issues that touches the core of their lives. Cruz distracts the conservative people. Sanders would distract the very liberal people. The moderates would be distracted by the rest. Now everyone is distracted and none of these candidates would confront the elite-businessmen who are exploiting the people and destroying the country. We need a qualified, honest, strong man who is willing to confront the elite-businessmen. None of the other candidates is willing/ dares to touch the elite-businessmen. Trump is rich enough to finance his own campaign to some extent. Our role will come when the financial burden overwhelms him, we will support him with our little dollars. The river is made of water drops. He is not waiting for the elite-businessmen to spend on him and buy his allegiance. He is a man who will lead the country, not only rule it.

Moderator Lester Holt reminded Trump that he said Clinton doesnât have a âpresidential lookâ and asked him what he meant by that. âShe doesnât have the look,â Trump replied. âShe doesnât have the stamina. I said she doesnât have the stamina and I donât believe she does have the stamina. ToÂ be President of this country, you need tremendous stamina.â Clinton, who was an absolute badass the entire debate, just stood there. And laughed. And smiled. And let him talk. Then, when it was her turn, she turned the burn up to 9,000 degrees: âWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.â Watch Clinton bring down the hammer below:  ",0,1,0
1325,"Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the “NBC Nightly News” anchor of mirroring Crowley’s infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night. In an interview with “Fox and Friends,” Giuliani said he watched the debate two times — once live, “and then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.” Story Continued Below Donald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Monday’s faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an “act of terror.” (PolitiFact rated Romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that Obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed."") Giuliani took issue with Holt “ignorantly” attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War. A federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued. “The thing that’s wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,” Giuliani said. “He’s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.” The former mayor maintained that “every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America” but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt “because she failed the bar exam.” “But I’m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,” he continued. “And I’d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you’re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.” “I’m a lawyer. I’m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,” Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. “I’m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night — if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you’re gonna interrupt and you’re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.” Giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being “completely unprofessional” and “totally unethical” and suggesting that “he should have had enough energy to check the sources” regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War. “I saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,” Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern. “A hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,” Giuliani said.",1,0,0
1272,"The bribery and corruption trial for New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez will be delayed while he seeks Supreme Court intervention in his case, a federal court has ordered. The Justice Dept. had asked that Menendez's trial move ahead after the Third Circuit of Appeals rejected his bid to the have the allegations against him thrown out. Story Continued Below But the Third Circuit ruled on Monday that the trial will be delayed while Menendez petitions the Supreme Court to hear his appeal. That means that any trial — if it does take place — likely won't happen before 2017. Menendez was indicted in April 2015 for allegedly accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper gifts and campaign contributions as bribes in exchange for using his office to help Dr. Salomon Melgen, a longtime friend and major campaign contributor. The Justice Dept. alleges Menendez received nearly $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from Melgen. In turn, Menendez allegedly intervened on Melgen’s behalf in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and attempted to enforce a $500 million port security contract with the Dominican Republic, as well as obtaining visa applications for several of Melgen’s girlfriends. Menendez has argued that under the Speech or Debate clause — a constitutional privilege that shields lawmakers and staff from legal action over legitimate legislative activities — he could not be charged with improperly aiding Melgen.

1236,"As the coal industry and the Obama administration brace for a potentially momentous legal showdown over climate-change policy at a federal appeals court this week, the industry is mounting part of its argument in an unusual venue: on the radio. For the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday's oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Story Continued Below ""On September 27th the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has an important decision to make on EPA’s Power Plan. It’s a decision that affects every American’s ability to have affordable energy and jeopardizes every state’s ability to make their own energy policies and it will be a clear violation of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution,"" a serious-sounding announcer declares as ominous music plays in the background. ""It is our duty to uphold the Constitution and say no to EPA’s Power Plan."" A video posted online by the same pro-coal group uses similar language, suggesting a need to take action on Tuesday. “On September 27, it is our duty to uphold the Constitution and the people it is designed to protect,"" the video says. The ads and the video never explain precisely who's being called on to do ""our duty,"" but the EPA plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is not going before Congress this week nor is there some referendum. The only people who get to vote Tuesday (or soon thereafter) are 10 of the 11 active judges on the D.C. Circuit. (Chief Judge Merrick Garland has bowed out of hearing cases while his Supreme Court nomination is pending.) Legal ethics rules prohibit lawyers involved in a case from engaging in out-of-court communications with judges under most circumstances. Judges are usually prohibited from initiating or permitting out-of-court contact about a case and are supposed to put such communications on the record when they do occur. The theory behind the rules is that cases should be decided based on written briefs and arguments presented in the courtroom. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Energy is one of the parties challenging the Environmental Protection Agency power-plant rules in the series of cases set to be heard Tuesday during an extraordinary court session planned to stretch for more than three-and-a-half hours, not counting a lunch break. A spokeswoman for the group, Laura Sheehan, said she was not available for an interview Friday. She did not respond to emailed queries about the cost and scope of the ad campaign or the target audience. “The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision is critically important as it will either put a halt to EPA’s out-of-control regulatory decision making or give it the green light to continue to run roughshod over states’ constitutional rights,” Sheehan said in a statement posted on the group's website. Prominent legal ethics experts said there's little doubt the ads are aimed at influencing the D.C. Circuit judges. ""They're obviously aimed at intimidating the court into doing what is politically popular, letting the judges know there will be repercussions if they don't decide it the right way,"" said Richard Painter,a law professor at the University of Minnesota and a White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. ""They're not running these ads aimed at people affected by the administration's position on coal. They're aimed at the judges and their families and friends trying to put the heat on them....This is one more step in the direction of politicizing the courts."" Painter said the ads would be improper if lawyers for the parties before the court were involved. ""I don't think lawyers litigating the case would have anything to do with this. That would be highly unprofessional,"" he said. The ads and online video quote renowned Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe saying alarmingly that endorsing the administration's crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions would be like ""burning the Constitution."" The comments come from congressional testimony Tribe offered last year. The group's video actually shows fire appearing to consume the nation's founding document Tribe did not respond to emails asking if he was involved in producing the ads or approved of them. He's set to argue at Tuesday's court session on behalf of coal mining firm Peabody Energy and several others members of the coal-industry coalition running the ads. Some ethics lawyers said the ads are protected by the First Amendment, but may not be a good idea. ""The trade group is engaging in free speech. But it risks annoying the judges,"" said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. ""Assuming that risk is unwise because the judges won't be influenced. I bet the industry's lawyers are themselves chagrined by the campaign. The judges are expected to ignore what they may hear just as they are expected to ignore, [such as] an editorial, and decide based only on the record."" Advertising advocating for a specific outcome in a pending court case is highly unusual, but not unprecedented. When the Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of bans on gay marriage last year, a group of Christian pastors and activists took out a full-page Washington Post ad days before the decision, urging the court not to require states to recognize gay marriage. The court did so anyway, by 5-4 vote. In-person protests related to Supreme Court cases are common, but the court has managed to use its rules to push them off its grounds and onto the adjoining sidewalks. Last year, the D.C. Circuit upheld those rules. The Supreme Court has also upheld a state law that courthouse banned demonstrations near courthouses, even when aimed at judges rather than jurors. The lengths to which the coal industry is willing to go to try to influence the outcome of this week's arguments may reflect the unusually pivotal role the D.C. Circuit could play in the case—one that may wind up being more critical than the Supreme Court. That's because it seems possible, if not likely, that the shorthanded high court could split 4-4 in the case. If that happens, the D.C. Circuit ruling would stand. On February 9, the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to halt implementation of the EPA power-plant rules until the D.C. Circuit resolves the case and the justices have a chance to decide whether to take up a virtually-certain petition to review that decision. Four days later, Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in his room during a trip to a Texas ranch. The earlier vote on the stay application suggests it wouldn't be granted if the issue arose today and suggests—although it is far from certain— that the court could divide along ideological lines on the underlying case.",1,0,0
482,"Washington (CNN)Four days before the government is scheduled to run out of money, lawmakers on Capitol Hill remain at odds about whether to add millions of dollars for Flint, Michigan, to a spending bill to keep agencies operating. Democrats are insisting help for Flint -- hard hit last year by lead poisoning in its drinking water supply -- be attached to the must-pass bill. If it's not, they vow to block the legislation on a key vote in the Senate on Tuesday, leaving little time to get a funding bill through both chambers. But top Democrats signaled Monday there may be a way to resolve the impasse: if House Republicans were to assure them the Flint money would make it into a separate bill that the House is voting on this week. A top House Republican leader seemed receptive to the idea. ""This funding measure does not quote a single penny for Flint, Michigan. Not a penny. The people of Flint, Michigan, have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean their poison water for more than a year,"" Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said in a floor speech. ""Senate Republicans claim they'll address the needs of Flint when we return after the election. We've heard that before, haven't we?"" Republicans counter that Reid's demand for Flint funding to be added to the government spending bill are new and may be politically motivated, designed to disrupt smooth passage of government funding and make Republicans appear ineffective just weeks before the presidential and congressional elections that will determine the balance of power in the capital. ""It's true that some in Democratic leadership would like to turn this simple 10-week funding bill into some unnecessary partisan food fight,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. ""They think it's good election-year politics."" Last Thursday, after weeks of unresolved negotiations, frustrated Senate Republicans stepped away from the negotiating table and put a GOP-authored bill on the floor, essentially daring Democrats to oppose it. The Republican bill would fund the government and the federal response to Zika. Importantly, Republicans said it met Democratic demands for leaving out controversial policy riders. The bill also included what Republicans described as a ""down payment"" for disaster aid for flood-stricken Louisiana. But Democratic leaders balked arguing they couldn't support money for flooding for Louisiana unless Flint was also addressed. Earlier this month, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, a major water bill that included $220 million in relief aid and loans for Flint. The House is set to pass its version of that bill this week, but it doesn't have any money for Flint. Democrats remain skeptical Republicans will actually agree to provide money for Flint as the two chambers merge those two competing bills into final legislation. However, a Democratic source suggested Monday that one possible way to end the stalemate would be for House Republicans to give Democrats an ""ironclad"" commitment that the Flint money would be added to that pending water bill. Reid suggested that was a possible path forward, too, when he said on the floor to Republicans: ""Call and tell me they're going to take care of this. Give me some assurance we're going to take care of it."" Senate Republicans believe they've already shown a commitment to Flint when they overwhelmingly approved the water bill with Flint funding and have vowed to press House Republicans to do the same. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, told reporters Monday the Flint aid ""works perfectly"" in the water bill. McCarthy would not say if he would allow the House Democrats to add the Flint aid as an amendment to the water bill, but argued that it would be an issue for a conference committee to settle since the aid is included in the Senate package. Senators will vote Tuesday afternoon on whether to begin debate on the government funding bill. Sixty votes are needed for it to advance and Democrats should be able to block it despite a couple of defections from Democratic senators whose states are impacted by Zika and who want to quickly approve that funding.

He is mostly known for his role in comedy films such as “Ace Ventura” and “Dumb and Dumber.” Unfortunately, the actor is in some trouble and it might just be the end for him.  Jim Carrey was hit with hard news last September when he found out that his 28-year-old girlfriend Cathriona White committed suicide. Apparently she had left a suicide note to Jim before overdosing. After finding out about her death he immediately released a comment sharing how shocked and heartbroken he was. “I am shocked and deeply saddened by the passing of my sweet Cathriona. She was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled. My heart goes out to her family and friends and to everyone who loved and cared about her. We have all been hit with a lightning bolt.”  When the police showed up to investigate the crime scene they found 3 different prescriptions on White’s nightstand. Ambien (sleep aid), Percocet (painkiller), and Propranolol (blood pressure/heart). TMZ reported that all of the medications were prescribed by the same doctor but they were under the name Arthur King, which was Jim Carrey’s alias. This wasn’t Cathriona’s first time trying to kill herself. IT was reported that she attempted an overdose in 2012 after her father passed away. Now Carrey is being ACCUSED of supplying his ex with the pills that took her life. The lawsuit claims that Carrey gave the pills to Cathriona just 3 or 4 days before her death. It also states that Jim tried to cover up the fact that he gave her the pills by texting her asking her if she had taken them from his house. Not only that, but apparently she was already taking painkillers weeks before her death.  Of course, Carrey knew that she has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts so it is crazy to think that he would actually give her the pills knowing her mental state. It was understood that the couple had broken up not long before Cathriona committed suicide and she even said that she couldn’t go on without him in her suicide note. “I’ve spent 3 days now in disbelief that you’re not here. I can go on brokenhearted and try to put the pieces back. I could, I just don’t have the will this time….I’m sorry you felt I wasn’t there for you. I tried to give you my best part. I don’t really know about burial or that sort of thing. You are my family so whatever you choose will be fine…Please forgive me. I’m just not for this world.”  This is so wild!",0,0,1

On Wednesday, Trump urged congressional negotiators to delay a U.S. handoff of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a private-sector, nonprofit organization that manages Internet domain names.

Threats of terror, both abroad and at home, have repeatedly rolled the race for the White House and the candidates have sought to improve their standing with voters in their responses to the terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino, Calif., and most recently after the attacks in New York and New Jersey. Polls generally show that voters trust Trump more than Hillary Clinton to handle terrorism.  Trump's tough talk about combating terrorism and threats abroad, including a plan to erect a wall at the US-Mexico border and his repeated suggestion that profiling as a preventative tactic against terrorism has helped fueled his rise. While a majority (63%) of white, working-class Americans say immigrants from Muslim countries are generally good people, the same share say that immigrants from Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks. Members of this group, which exit polls had at around 44% of the US electorate in 2012 though the exact figure is difficult to quantify, also have a more negative view of immigration: nearly half (47%) of whites without a college degree view immigrants as a burden on the country. Even among those white, working-class voters who view immigrants as a burden, 50% say immigrants from Muslim countries are good people compared with 35% who say they are not.  There is also a partisan divide: White, working-class Democrats are more likely to hold positive views about immigrants from Muslim countries than their white, working-class Republican counterparts. 47% of white Democrats without college degrees say Muslim immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US compared with 83% of white Republicans with no college degree. Trump has made his hard line against Muslims a key component of his campaign, and his white, working-class supporters have strong views about the impact of immigrants from Muslim countries. Fifty-three percent of white voters without college degrees who are considering supporting Trump say immigrants from Muslim countries are basically good, but 82% say they increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US. 'Under attack' More than 6-in-10 white, working-class Americans also say that Christian values are under attack in the United States. That viewpoint is more widespread among older working-class whites than among younger ones. Seventy-three % of white, working class adults 65 and older said Christian values are under attack, while just 41% of working-class adults under the age of 30 said the same. Trump backers were more likely to say that Christian values were under attack than those who support Clinton. Eighty-one percent of white, working-class voters who would consider supporting him in November said Christian values were under attack, compared to 31% who support Clinton. Candidate positioning In the hours following the bombings in New York and New Jersey, Clinton and Trump tussled over who was better qualified to combat terrorism as well as its cause.  Clinton cast herself as the candidate best prepared to combat terrorism and said that her opponent's positions are ""not grounded in fact"" and ""meant to make some kind of demagogic point."" ""I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges,"" the former secretary of state told reporters on Monday, ""not engage in a lot of irresponsible, reckless rhetoric."" Trump blamed Clinton and President Barack Obama for failing to keep the country safe and called for profiling to beef up what he sees as currently lackluster anti-terrorism efforts. Instead of treading lightly, Trump said on Fox News Monday morning, the better approach would be to ""knock the hell out of 'em."" ""Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are,"" Trump told Fox. ""They are afraid to do anything about it, because they don't want to be accused of profiling. And they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things."" The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9 through September 5 among a nationally representative sample of 1,614 adults, including 701 people who were identified as working class whites -- white non-Hispanic adults who do not currently hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, not currently enrolled in school. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 5 points for results among members of the white working class, 6 points for whites with degrees, 10 points for black working class respondents and 9 points for the Hispanic working class.

677,"The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, is troubled by the cash payments to Iran. You have to agree: You don’t want your enemy to be enabled to fight you harder, stronger, or longer. In his rush to create a legacy, President Obama has created, instead, this problem that our military must face. Read the article below.  As Written By Kristina Wong for The Hill: Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the nation’s top military officer, said Thursday that reports that U.S. payments to Iran will go to the Iranian military are “troubling.” “It certainly is troubling. The more funds that they have available, obviously the more effective they’ll be in spreading malign influence,” the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He was responding to questioning by Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), a member of the committee, who referenced recent reports that the Iranian government has approved a law that would allocate to the military the $1.7 billion the U.S. paid Iran this year to settle a failed arms deal from the 1970s. The administration has argued the payment was not a “ransom,” as critics have claimed, but that an international nuclear accord signed in January paved the way for the payment and a release of prisoners at the same time. Since the signing of the accord, U.S. military leaders say Iranian naval forces have stepped up their harassment of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. Dunford also said Iran continues to be one of the lead ….. Full Story Here: Top US general: ‘Troubling’ that Iran military will get US cash | TheHill",0,0,1
142,"Donald Trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black Americans every day. The screw-up in question came as Trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the Jim Crow segregation era.  Speaking at a rally in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters. âWeâre going to make our country safe again. Weâre going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyâve ever been in before,â he said. âEver, ever, ever.â The comment, made in a city named for a slave owner, is objectively untrue, and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and Jim Crow laws. While the media has largely viewed Trumpâs weird racial comments as a sign that he is âreaching outâ to black voters, polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than Mitt Romney or John McCain. Black voters have had an inherent distrust of Trump, which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist âbirtherâ conspiracy there for years.Trump also called for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent. Lately, Trump has argued that the black community in America is a desperate, infantile mess, relying on government welfare in order to simply get by. The image Trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences, but instead have been targeted to a conservative base, high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out. Black voters have found Trumpâs description of them insulting, particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward. ",0,1,0
874,"Newly released footage has shed a troubling new light on a 2011 police shooting in St. Louis, showing an officer gun down a black suspect and then planting a gun on the crime scene. Officer Jason Stockley and his partner Brian Bianchi had engaged drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith in a high speed chase. Stockley can be heard saying “I’m going to kill this motherfucker.” The police rammed Smith off the road, and camera footage shows Stockley shooting five shots into the driver’s seat of Smith’s disabled car. New footage now reveals Stockley taking a gun out of a duffel back from the back of his own cruiser and planting it on Smith’s body. Stockley claimed in his report that Smith had pointed the weapon at him, justifying the use of lethal force. Subsequent DNA evidence on the gun, however, did not contain any DNA or fingerprints from Smith. Stockley will be tried for first degree murder. One of his initial hearings takes place on Oct. 3rd.

1264,"White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama will spend Monday night like he does most other Monday nights in the fall, watching TV while he works in the White House residence. Except instead of Monday Night Football, Earnest said Obama’s TV will be tuned to Monday night’s presidential debate. Story Continued Below “I anticipate that this fall Monday evening will be similar to fall Monday evenings in the White House residence, which is that the president will be working tonight with the television on in the background,” Earnest said at the news briefing. “I think the one difference will be instead of Monday night football, there’ll be a little more politics being discussed in the context of the debate.” Asked what advice the president might have for his former secretary of state, Earnest reiterated what Obama told ABC’s Robin Roberts in an interview last week, that Clinton should be herself and explain to voters her motivations for running for office. Asked what advice the president might have for Trump, Earnest replied that “even if we did, I’m confident it would go unheard.” The press secretary said he was not aware of any planned phone calls between Obama and Clinton today and added that the two had most recently spoken two weeks ago. Earnest said the president has high expectations for Clinton based on his “experience of going head-to-head with Secretary Clinton in the context of a debate and she performed quite well in those settings,” adding that “I think the president expects her to do the same tonight.” “This is an important moment in the campaign, and anybody that’s worked on a campaign at any level understands how significant candidate debates are. And it’s an opportunity for the candidates to square off and to speak for themselves in answering questions and describing their experience and their vision and their priorities,” Earnest said. “Look, there hasn’t been a lot of space for that in the context of this presidential election, so this is a rather unique opportunity for that kind of discussion to take place. And I think people are quite interested to tune in and see how the individual candidates handle themselves in this setting.” Regarding polls showing a tightening presidential race, Earnest said the White House has not been monitoring polls but suggested that a tight campaign might generate increased interest from American voters. “If reports about tightening polls convince more people to tune into the debate and educate themselves about the positions taken by the individual candidates and impress upon voters the need to be engaged in the political debate in this country, that’s a good thing.”",1,0,0
381,"(CNN)Even if their preferred candidate wins, a new poll released Wednesday found that supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will feel more relief than excitement. The findings from the Pew Research Center revealed widespread disenchantment toward this year's presidential contest among American voters. Majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). Those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. Only 25% of Clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. There was little more enthusiasm among Trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the GOP nominee triumphs in November. But many more Clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. Ditto for Trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. According to Pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if Trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious. The race between Clinton and Trump represents a battle between two of the least liked major party candidates in history, and Pew's findings are hardly the first to show that voters are largely disappointed with both. A Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found Clinton and Trump to be the two most unpopular presidential candidates in decades. The Pew Research Center report is based on a random sample of 3,941 registered voters who are members of the Center's American Trends Panel. Respondents took the survey between August 16 and September 12 online or by mail, and were originally recruited via nationally representative telephone surveys. Results among registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 2.6 percentage points. ",1,0,0
996,"NEW YORK — Staring down tightening polls both nationwide and in the battleground states, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook on Monday circulated a private memo to donors, supporters and top volunteers that maps out the Democratic nominee’s various paths to the White House in November, paired with his analysis of Donald Trump’s own precarious path. “Here’s the story that no poll can tell: Hillary Clinton has many paths to 270 electoral votes, while Donald Trump has very few. Hillary is nearly certain to win 16 ‘ blue' states, including Washington D.C., which will garner her 191 electoral votes,” writes Mook in the nearly 2,000-word memo that was blasted out in the early evening, and which was obtained by POLITICO. “If we add the five states that FiveThirtyEight.com gives Hillary a 70% or greater chance of winning (Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin), Hillary only needs 10 more electoral votes."" Story Continued Below Writing at a time when Democrats are growing increasingly nervous about the state of the race — and as leading party members like President Barack Obama and Clinton herself are loudly warning that the vote is going to be close — Mook then runs down the possibilities for Clinton to win the remaining 10 electoral votes: taking Florida’s 29 electoral votes, North Carolina’s 15, Ohio’s 18, or any two of Colorado, New Hampshire, Iowa, or Nevada. “Put a different way, of these battleground states, Hillary can win just one (Florida, Ohio, or North Carolina) and win the presidency, which means the six additional states would only add more electoral votes to her total,” he writes. “Donald Trump, on the other hand, must win six of these seven states, including Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio — none of which he can lose."" Mook’s analysis tracks with what top party strategists have been saying about the Democrat-Republican split for months, though it clashes with the Trump team’s own inclusion of Pennsylvania in the battleground mix. Clinton, for her part, has also drilled down on that state, calculating that it should go her way but that the Republican’s chances are nearly nonexistent without it. Titled “50 days until Election Day,” the memo serves in part as a way to calm down hand-wringing party members who are increasingly concerned that Trump is gaining on Clinton — her lead in the four-way RealClearPolitics national average is 0.7 points, down from its peak of 7.6 in early August. But the note is also a rallying mechanism, urging supporters to make more calls and knock on more doors in the homestretch. It runs through some of Clinton’s policy positions and some standard knocks on Trump — including quoting GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, who this summer said Trump’s insistence that a judge of Mexican heritage couldn’t be unbiased in a case involving the candidate is “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” But it doesn’t stray far from Clinton’s public line, except to go hard negative against Clinton’s opponent at a time she is striving to push a more affirmative, not just anti-Trump, message. The missive also identifies some of Democrats’ structural and infrastructural advantages, such as the higher proportions of young voters and people of color in the battlegrounds than in 2012, before — in a tried-and-true campaign maneuver, taking pains to calm backers by dismissing public polls and the media. “You’ve heard us say many times that public polls must be taken with a grain of salt, but here’s why we should just dump out the entire salt shaker: in early September, an ABC/News Washington Post poll showed Hillary leading by eight points. Four days later, Reuters/IPSOS released a poll saying Hillary’s lead was only one point. Here’s my favorite: earlier this month, a CBS/YouGov poll showed Hillary winning Ohio by seven points (46-39) and three days later a Bloomberg Poll came out showing Trump winning Ohio by five (44-39),” Mook writes. “A swing of 12 points in three days? Go figure. Is Ohio a very close contest? YES. Battleground states carry that name for a reason: they’re going to be close, from now until Election Day.""",1,0,0
14,"The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured. John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters. ""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant. Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.     In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism. A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent. The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent. ""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.   Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves. He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf."" James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump. ""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said. ""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",1,0,0

Keith Lamont Scott, a father of seven, was killed by police in an apartment complex parking lot Tuesday as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve. The shooting set off a long night of violent protests and Wednesday the demonstrations continued for a second night, starting off as a peaceful march through downtown Charlotte. But when the demonstrators neared an Omni Hotel, some people climbed the roof of an outdoor mall and started throwing objects at the crowd. Other people were banging on the doors of the hotel, and police in riot gear emerged in the entrance. His family said Scott, an African-American, was unarmed and sitting in his car reading a book, waiting for his son to come home from school. But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Scott exited his car with a gun, not a book. He said officers couldn’t find a book at the scene. “It’s time for the voiceless majority to stand up and be heard,” said the police chief, who is black. “It’s time to change the narrative because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media.” – CNN But…b…b…but what about the book?

39,"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made an impassioned plea in front of the United Nations Security Council today for all sides in the Syrian conflict to live up to their obligations under a cease-fire agreement. The move may be the best chance for the U.S. to help bring an end to the violence, humanitarian crisis and displacement of thousands of Syrians. Kerry's determination to restore the cease-fire comes in wake of the most flagrant yet of the violations: Two days ago, a United Nations humanitarian aid convoy headed to opposition-held areas of Aleppo was destroyed in a prolonged airstrike.     ""On Monday, 20 aid workers were killed in an outrageous, sustained, two-hour attack directed at a fully authorized humanitarian mission near Aleppo — fully authorized,"" Kerry told the Security Council this morning. ""All of the permits had been given. Everybody was on notice."" U.S. officials believe Russian aircraft, not Syrian, were responsible for the strike but have yet to publicly accuse Moscow. Yesterday the White House said it could have been only Russians or the Syrian regime and that either way, Russia is accountable for the strikes, given its leverage over Syria and its commitments under the cease-fire. In spite of all this, rather than abandon the cease-fire, Kerry today urged the Syrian regime to adhere to its terms, calling for the grounding of all regime aircraft. ""Our purpose in this negotiation was to put an end to the kind of horrific and indiscriminate attacks that have been the primary cause of fear, of suffering, of displacement,"" Kerry said. ""And under our plan, all of this could be quickly accompanied by serious negotiations between the parties, aimed at a political transition and a conclusion to the conflict."" Meanwhile, the Russians have released a series of conflicting statements in an effort to justify the strike on the U.N. convoy. They suggested at one point the convoy was accompanied by an armed opposition vehicle and most recently suggested the strike might have been carried out by a U.S. drone flying in the region. The U.S. Defense Department quickly denied that, saying it doesn't fly aircraft over that area of Syria. Moscow has yet to respond to Kerry's request to ground all regime aircraft, but negotiations will likely continue through the rest of the week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Members of the International Syria Support Group are expected to convene again in the coming days. ""The future of Syria is hanging by a thread, and I urge this council not to give up,"" Kerry said today. ""And I urge the entire international community to get behind the best chance that we have yet had to reduce the violence, to provide humanitarian assistance and to open up the space for negotiations.""",1,0,0

1193,"NEWARK — A Donald Trump aide who worked for Gov. Chris Christie testified in federal court Friday that the Republican governor’s office meticulously tracked which local mayors had received special treatment and how likely they were to endorse his re-election campaign. Matt Mowers, who was an aide in Christie’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, or IGA, told prosecutors that the office used a Google Document to note when a local mayor or council person had been invited to sporting events, invited to breakfast at the governor’s mansion or received steel from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. Story Continued Below Mowers, testifying in the George Washington Bridge lane closure trial, said officials were given a score on a scale of 1-10 about how likely they were to endorse Christie’s 2013 campaign. Mowers said in U.S. District Court that the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, where the bridge is located, was among those officials. Mowers had been assigned to the mayor, Mark Sokolich, and other officials in the northern part of the state, as part of his job at a regional director with the office. Sokolich, he wrote in the document, had a good chance of being persuaded. “Only thing that could prevent endorsement is possible ambition for higher office (county executive),” Mowers said he wrote about the Democrat from Bergen County. Mowers said he spoke to Sokolich frequently, meeting with the mayor about once a month and also calling every few weeks. They attended sporting events. They helped get Port Authority funding for local shuttle buses, with the governor writing the bistate agency a letter requesting the buses. Mowers said Sokolich even request a letter of recommendation from the governor to help his son get into Rutgers University. The two had a good, friendly relationship, Mowers said. By 2013, they began discussing the possibility that Sokolich would endorse Christie — at the mayor’s request, said Mowers, who is currently a national field coordinator working on the Trump campaign. Sokolich testified earlier in the week that Mowers had been pushing him to endorse and that he’d felt uncomfortable at times. But Mowers said the mayor was so interested that he discussed having the entire town council endorse Christie, and suggested doing so after the Democratic primary so as not to upset the county party bosses. “Given that he brought it up and the rest of the council was interested in endorsing as well,” Mowers said, he thought it “was something he would consider.” But Sokolich ultimately told him he couldn’t do it, Mowers said. Mowers said that at a meeting in March 2013 in Fort Lee, the mayor said he was concerned about his private business as a zoning attorney, and that he could lose contracts with local municipalities for endorsing Christie. Mowers sent a text message to a higher ranking employee in the IGA saying what happened: “Unfortunately, I think Sokolich is going to be a no. It’s a shame, too, I really like the guy.” He added in another message: “He flat out said ‘I wish I had the balls to do it’.” Mowers left the governor’s office to join the Trump campaign the next month. He said he heard twice after that from Bridget Anne Kelly, who was his boss at governor’s office, asking if he’d heard from Sokolich again. First she called him on his cell phone on the evening of August 12. “At first, she called and we exchange pleasantries,” he said. “Then she asked if Mayor Sokolich is definitely not endorsing.” “Ok, great, that’s all I needed to know,” she replied, Mowers said. On Sept. 9, two local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge were closed, causing major traffic jams in Fort Lee. It was that day that Kelly sent Mowers a message asking again about Sokolich and whether they had spoken. He said they had not. Kelly, who was a deputy chief of staff to the governor, and Bill Baroni, who was the deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are accused of closing access lanes to the bridge to punish Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie. The Port controls the bridge. They allegedly worked with David Wildstein, who was the director of interstate capital projects for the bi-state agency. He had already pleaded guilty and plans to testify against both defendants this afternoon. Christie, who is currently a top adviser to Trump, has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. But prosecutors said on Monday the governor was told of the traffic gridlock on the third day of the lane closings. Baroni and Kelly, both 44, were indicted last May on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations.",1,0,0
1415,"Obama’s time as president is almost over and millions of Americans are counting down the days until he vacates the Oval Office. He promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change America and he did… for the worse. It’s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he’s left office, considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure. But that hasn’t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling Americans that they need to protect his legacy once he’s left office. In a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night, Obama used Jim Crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “right” candidate. He told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake, so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote. And those people, of course, need to vote for Hillary Clinton.   While Obama did not mention Hillary by name, he said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her. “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” he said. “And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate who’s defining principal, the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done.” He then cited the historic turnout among the African-American community in 2008 and 2012, saying, “I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down it’s guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send off? Go vote!”   Of course, history contradicts everything that Obama said. It was Democrats, not Republicans, that supported slavery, segregation and Jim Crow laws. The Republican Party was formed specifically to end slavery. The original Congressional Black Caucus were the first black members of Congress… and they were Republicans. Democrats came up with the Ku Klux Klan in order to prevent black Americans from voting. Meanwhile, Obama’s actual legacy with the black community isn’t exactly stellar. It was the Obama administration that cancelled D.C.’s school voucher program, so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools, like the one Obama’s children got to attend. And under Obama’s leadership, unemployment and food stamp usage have skyrocketed, hitting the black community harder than any other. He’s done nothing about the destruction of the black family, the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year, or the fact that almost 76% of black children are born out of wedlock. And he wants to brag about his legacy? Is he out of his mind? ",0,0,1
265,"Estero, Florida (CNN)Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions. The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law. He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism. ""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables."" ""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists."" Clinton has, in fact, discussed terrorism. Earlier in the day, she touted her national security experience from serving as secretary of state, saying she would ""launch an intelligence surge"" and that she would put more into ""training and intelligence they need to effectively prevent and respond to terrorist attacks."" Rather than the policies of President Barack Obama's administration, which Trump argued are responsible for the threat of terrorism, Trump called once again for a radical rethinking of counterterrorism policies in the US. He emphasized the need for ""extreme vetting"" and again called for a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism -- the latest iteration of his ban on Muslims -- while arguing that ""immigration security is national security."" ""My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency,"" Trump said. And championing the cause of many hawkish conservatives, Trump appeared to argue that terrorist suspects captured on US soil like Ahmad Khan Rahami, the New York and New Jersey bombing suspect who was apprehended earlier Monday, should be treated as ""foreign enemy combatants."" Rahami is a naturalized US citizen who under current law is entitled to due process rights. ""Congress should pass measures to ensure that foreign enemy combatants are treated as such. These are enemies. These are combatants and we have to be tough and we have to be strong,"" Trump said. Those comments came after Trump lamented the fact that Rahami would be treated humanely and in accordance with the law. ""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he'll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is,"" Trump said. ""We must also use whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before it's no longer timely,"" he added. Trump also responded to Clinton's accusations earlier Monday that Trump and his harsh rhetoric against Muslims has been a recruiting tool for ISIS. Clinton had said: ""I think it is important for voters to know and hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November. We know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS. Because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam."" ""Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monster of evil on us,"" Trump said. Instead, Trump boomeranged Clinton's attack back at her, arguing that Clinton and President Barack Obama's policies have helped ISIS's recruiting efforts. ""Weakness invites aggression and silence in the face of a brutal enemy ... allows them to spread and that's what's happening all over the world,"" Trump said. The Republican nominee also speculated, without evidence, that if Obama could do it again he wouldn't choose Clinton to serve in his Cabinet. ",1,0,0
671,"Liberals in the media and the political arena thought that Hillary Clinton’s victory was in the bag. The rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the White House her residence once again. Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention. But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.” For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states. Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump? At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question: “Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.” At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done.

1042,"Child migrants suffered a major setback in the federal courts on Tuesday, but Congress and the White House also found themselves lectured to from the bench for failing to do more to help the juveniles, thousands of whom have been thrown into deportation hearings without defense counsel. At one level, the ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a clear victory for the Justice Department. It effectively dooms a long-awaited federal district court trial, scheduled to begin in November in Seattle, on the children’s right to counsel. Story Continued Below But at a second level, Justice’s win had a hollow ring as two of the three judges wrote a concurring opinion that repeatedly invoked the words of former Attorney General Eric Holder that the government has a “moral obligation” to ensure the presence of counsel for the children. “What is missing here. Money and resolve — political solutions that fall outside the purview of the courts,” wrote Judge Margaret McKeown, a Democratic appointee, together with her Republican appointee colleague, Judge Milan Smith. “The stakes are too high,” they concluded. “To give meaning to ‘Equal Justice Under Law,’ the tag line engraved on the U.S. Supreme Court building, to ensure the fair and effective administration of our immigration system, and to protect the interests of children who must struggle through that system, the problem demands action now.” The underlying case arises from a federal lawsuit filed against the government in July 2014 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The backdrop was the record number of border crossings that spring and summer by unaccompanied children from Central America. In the ensuing turmoil, the Obama administration responded by ordering the immigration courts to quickly arraign the new arrivals, with or without legal counsel. The accelerated proceedings — dubbed rocket dockets — overwhelmed the fragile network of private attorneys typically available to the children. Judges seized the chance to issue removal orders on the spot, and in the first 13 months, nearly 2,800 juveniles — hundreds of whom were 14 or younger — received deportation orders after being afforded only a single hearing and no defense counsel. The crisis has since moved out of the headlines, but the total number of removal orders issued for the child migrants since July 2014 had already passed 12,300 by the end of May. These decisions have become a very real threat to the young migrants, especially those who arrived as teenagers and are now 18 or older. Filed in Seattle, the lawsuit landed before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly, who cautiously tried to define some middle ground that would at least extend added protections for the youngest defendants. When Justice challenged his jurisdictional authority to hear the case, Zilly issued a telltale decision in April 2015 that effectively split the baby. On the narrow statutory grounds, Zilly agreed with the administration. But on the larger constitutional question of the children’s due process rights, Zilly refused to dismiss the lawsuit outright and said the plaintiffs deserved a timely answer. It was this April 2015 decision by Zilly that brought the case to the 9th Circuit, where the administration argued that the district court had overstepped its jurisdiction and any due process claims of the children were subject to the limits imposed by Congress. “Whatever Congress provides them, is their due process,” a Justice attorney told the court bluntly in one exchange when the case was argued in July. That did not sit well with the panel, but at the same time, the judges faulted the plaintiffs trying to go around the narrow legal path set out by Congress for any such appeals. It is this legal path — governing deportation appeals — that is at the nub of the jurisdictional fight. As set out in statute, all such deportation appeals must first go to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the same immigration court system that has dealt so harshly with the children. Only after exhausting this remedy can a defendant next file a petition for review and get a hearing with the respective federal appeals court for his or her circuit. Advocates for the children argue that this poses a Catch-22 in that no child without an attorney can be expected to navigate such a complicated appeals process. The system becomes punitive, they say, and effectively denies due process, requiring the courts to intervene. In truth, Zilly, appointed to the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan, has struggled openly with the very same legal dilemma from the outset of the lawsuit two years ago. He ultimately felt that the constitutional due process question had sufficient weight to demand a timely court hearing and allow him to move ahead for at least the youngest children. Time and again, he showed a special concern for those under 14 years old. So much so that in a recent filing, the plaintiffs argued for a summary judgment at least for this “subclass” of child migrants. The appeals panel clearly shared some of that concern but wanted a tidier path to get to an answer and around the federal statutes. Having failed to find one, Tuesday’s ruling wipes out what has been years of work by child advocates trying to get a court hearing on the right-to-counsel issue. “The 9th Circuit today held that the courthouse doors are effectively closed to thousands of children whose only opportunity to seek appointed counsel in their immigration proceedings is through this case,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, who has been the ACLU’s lead counsel on the case. “The court issued that ruling even as it simultaneously recognized that virtually all children cannot represent themselves in immigration proceedings.” “We disagree with this decision, and will continue the fight to ensure that the claims of these children to appointed counsel receive their day in court. In light of the 9th Circuit’s recognition of the moral imperative at stake, we again call on the Obama administration to exercise its power to cease its unjust practice of requiring children to represent themselves in immigration court.” Matt Adams, who has taken the lead in the case for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, was scathing in his frustration with the court’s ruling. “The court determined that a theoretical possibility for judicial review suffices even where as a practical matter, the thousands of unrepresented children will be ordered deported without ever having an opportunity to argue that they are need an attorney to get a fair hearing,” Adams said. “The court points to one case of an unrepresented child back in 2004 that reached its doors. ... But if there is only one case in 15 years, with thousands of other children who have been deported, this only demonstrates there is no meaningful opportunity.” Justice had no immediate public comment, but privately officials signaled little joy with the win. Indeed, the harsh treatment of the children in 2014 and 2015 remains a genuine embarrassment for the White House. Draft rules are under consideration to create a more uniform system nationally, under which immigration judges would give children more time to find lawyers. And before the president leaves office next year, there is pressure to have these completed and in place.",1,0,0
236,"(CNN)Jeb(!) Bush is back. The former Republican presidential candidate had a cameo in the Emmys opening sequence Sunday night, appearing as a limo driver who's ""in between jobs right now."" In the sketch, host Jimmy Kimmel hitched various rides from celebrities to the Emmys, before running into the motorcade for Julia Louis Dreyfus' character in ""Veep."" She flatly refused to let him in her limo, but a voice from the driver's seat told the comedian there was plenty of room up front. Kimmel opened up the passenger seat door only to find the former Florida governor in a full-blown limo-driver suit, hat included. ""You know you can make $12 an hour driving for Uber?"" Bush asks. (Bush was a big Uber fan who frequently praised the company in his stump speech.) When Kimmel told him he was going to the Emmy's and that he was nominated, Bush offered a self-deprecating line. ""Wow, what's that like?"" He then gave Kimmel some advice on his Emmy candidacy. ""If you run a positive campaign, the voters ultimately will make the right choice, Jimmy,"" Bush said, alluding to his unsuccessful primary fights with Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. But when Kimmel began to reflect on the comment, Bush shut it down. ""That was a joke. Get out of the car,"" he said, calling Kimmel a ""godless Hollywood hippie."" In a nod to his famous logo, Bush then yelled ""Jeb Exclamation Point!"" as he drove off, leaving Kimmel standing his dust. The scene was taped last Sunday at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Florida, where Bush has his office. After the segment aired Sunday, Bush was still good-humored about his on-screen role as an Uber driver. ""Hey, @jimmykimmel, I'm giving you 5 stars!

The report cites “countless attacks on refugees and their shelters” in the past year as well as outbursts of violence in Heidenau and Freital, two cities located near Dresden in the state of Saxony. Such attacks are “symbols of a growing hate of foreigners.” Excerpts of the report were published on Wednesday in the Handelsblatt newspaper after the business daily obtained a copy of it. The “worrying trend” could “threaten the peace of the Eastern German society,” said Iris Gleicke according to Handelsblatt. Gleicke is a member of the government in charge of the country’s former Eastern bloc that was under communist rule. Areas in former East Germany remain poorer than former West Germany, with a GDP about a quarter lower than in the West, the report said, adding that differences have largely disappeared since the reunification in 1990. According to statistics, hate crime in the East is well above the rest of the country. In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the far-right Alternative for Germany registered an unprecedented electoral success earlier this month, attacks on foreigners and migrants reached 58.7 per million inhabitants. The average for the western part of the country is 10.5, according to Handelsblatt. Also On Politico Hortense Goulard Also On Politico Hortense Goulard Also On Politico Ivo Oliveira Authorities started tracking violence against foreigners in 2001. It reached its peak in 2015, according to the report. The report also warned that far-right groups have been gaining strength from rising hatred against foreigners, saying that one such terror organization known as the National Socialist Underground has killed 10 people in recent years. The report noted that there are fewer foreigners in eastern Germany than in other parts of the country, underlining the fact that violence and hatred are not the result of the influx of migrants, but rather due to emigration from the East to other, richer parts of the country and a lack of social structures. The report also noted an increase in violent incidents from left-wing radicals in the former East. Left-wing militants “misuse demonstrations [against the far-right] and committed a number of criminal acts, sometimes associated with extreme violence, especially against the police,” it said.  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

828,"A man from Arizona spoke with reporters from the BBC and he did not hold back his opinions about a Muslims and Islam. The man was the founder of BombIslam.com who outspokenly talks about the danger of Islam in an uncensored way. He goes by the name Robert and he spends his Fridays taking videos of himself confronting Muslims in Phoenix.  He walks up to local Muslims right outside of their mosques asking them questions about their faith with the Quran in his hand. His videos are often controversial and confrontational. When he spoke to the reporters with the BBC they were horrified. Robert called out Islam and said that their prophet Muhammad was a war mongering tyrant pedophile who married female child brides. That’s not going to sit well with many people, LOL! Robert said, “What we’re doing right now is we’re going to do a little protest…me and a few of my friends that lets these Muslims know that they’re not going to get comfortable here in my state.” The BBC reporters were not impressed with his comments or actions. They called Robert’s group and website an anti Islamic hate group. That analysis is not remotely shocking at all. The BBC journalist narrated as Robert defaced the Quaran! Saying, “Robert rips out a page of the Quran… under UK law, these extreme protesters could be arrested for religious hatred. But America’s First Amendment protects Robert’s freedom of speech.” When another reporter from another outlet asked for Robert’s opinions on his interaction with the BBC reporter he went off on a tyrade. He clearly was not at all impressed with the British reporters. Seems as though the feeling was entirely mutual. Well, then no worries about hard feelings! Robert said, “I told these guys if I were a British person, I would feel it was my duty to overthrow my government. When they asked if I owned a gun, I pulled out a gun right then and there and put it on the table. We ate at a place called Raising Canes, which serves chicken tenders, but one of the British dudes was a vegetarian so he could only eat fries and coleslaw (hahaha).  I knew the entire time, their documentary was going to be biased against guys like me, but I knew what I was doing and knew more people would like my protest than dislike it. They titled it “United States of Hate: Muslims under attack” or some sh*t like that. It’s still hilarious to me every time I watch it. I couldn’t have filmed and edited it better myself. They basically made my video for me that day.”  Robert regularly updates his websites and goes on rants against the religion of Islam. Some are even video rants. While everyone certainly is on edge with the growing levels of Islamic radical terrorism his videos seem very far to the right. Labeling his videos as hate group propaganda isn’t necessarily an incorrect statement. Nobody stands outside of churches or synagogues berating people about their Christian or Jewish faith with a bible in hand to degrade and defile their faith. That is just over the top. ",0,0,1

Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late. Someone is lying and it’s just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn’t even do it.

Chicago (CNN)The Republican Party of 2016 has strayed so far from its principles that even Ronald Reagan would be unable to navigate his way through its thorny politics, according to Michael Steele, who was Republican National Committee chairman from 2009 to 2011 and is now a political analyst for MSNBC. ""Ronald Reagan, if he were a candidate running for any office today, would not win a Republican primary,"" Steele said to David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. ""Because the things that he would espouse, the policies, the values, the principles that he would lay out there, would be rejected,"" Steele said, before describing Reagan's position on taxes and immigration that would now be viewed as anathema to many Republicans. Instead of speaking to issues that have a real impact on people's lives, Steele sees a Republican Party that's grappling with a nominee who uses his national platform to focus on ""nonsensical"" issues like President Barack Obama's birth certificate, a matter that Steele bluntly called ""bullshit racism."" Whether Donald Trump wins or loses in November, Steele predicts that the tensions within the party will go unresolved. ""The Trump supporters will say, 'You didn't support him, that's why we lost.' That's a fight. The corporate class will say, 'God, why did we nominate him? That's why we lost.' (Capitol) Hill and the political class will say the same. The activists will be further dismayed and frustrated."" But Steele doesn't see this problem as being unique to Republicans. He views Bernie Sanders's candidacy as a manifestation of a similar tension between establishment figures and a progressive faction that wants to pull the party further to the left. ""The last time I checked, Bernie Sanders was not going away,"" Steele said. ""His millennial voters are pissed. They have transformed the party internally, operationally, through its (policy) platform. That is not Hillary Clinton's platform,"" Steele said, before predicting, ""More fun to come.""

Clearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them. But Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. “I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,” Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts. “Well I’ll tell you I looked up his history and I’m not seeing a lot of criminal history,” Mills replied. “We have something called the OSCN – the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There’s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I’ve been able to uncover.” But Hannity didn’t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest. Mills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants. Hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. “I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven’t uncovered any myself,” Mills said. “There has been some misinformation floated.” A disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a “source” within the department and said that “it’s a matter of time of when they’re gonna release this information.” Here’s the audio via Media Matters:  Once again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn’t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. Period. ",0,1,0
506,"White Plains, New York (CNN)In Hillary Clinton's eyes, Donald Trump knows he lost Monday night. Clinton, speaking with reporters on her plane, threw serious shade at Trump hours after the two met for the first presidential debate at Hofstra Univeristy. The former secretary of state gloated that she had a great night and said Trump, who complained about his microphone after the debate, knew he lost. As she walked away from reporters, Clinton was asked about Trump's complaints. Unable to resist, she turned around and said glibly, ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night."" After Monday's debate, Trump said that his microphone on the stage was ""defective."" ""My mic was defective within the room,"" he told reporters. ""I wonder, was that on purpose?"" In the eyes of most political experts and post-debate polls, Clinton got the best of Trump at Monday night's debate, using the 90-minute contest to drop considerable opposition research on the Republican nominee. Clinton looked at times gleeful on the debate stage as Trump repeatedly interrupted her and often took the bait on her attack lines. Afterward, her top aides were using words like ""unhinged"" and ""deranged"" to describe Trump's performance. ""We had a great, great time last night,"" Clinton said. ""So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that."" Clinton, though, left the door open about whether Trump would show up. ""Well, I'm going to show up,"" Clinton said. ""He gets to decide what he wants to do. ... If I'm the only person on stage, well, you know, I'm the only person on stage."" ",1,0,0
319,"Washington (CNN)Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid offered an explanation Tuesday for why Donald Trump won't disclose his tax returns: the Republican presidential nominee is ""faking his net worth."" The Nevada Democrat -- and frequent Trump foe -- levied the charge on Twitter, evoking a similar claim he made against the GOP's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. ""Trump is faking his net worth. He's not as rich as he would have us believe + a bad businessman. That's why we can't see his tax returns,"" Reid tweeted. Reid, citing an unnamed source, memorably accused Romney during the 2012 race of going 10 years without paying federal income taxes. Romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 through 2009, and his tax returns from 2010 and 2011. But he did not release additional returns. The Trump campaign did not return CNN's request for comment. Reid on Tuesday then went to the Senate floor to rip into Trump. ""The last thing the American people want or need is a president who will run another financial scam on each of them,"" the Nevada Democrat said. ""If elected, Donald Trump would be the scammer in chief. Trump is a fraud."" ""He's always looking for a mark, some victim for one of his schemes,"" Reid added. ""And now our country is Trump's next target. He wants this to be his biggest payoff ever."" Reid's speech focused what he sees as lies about Trump's money and said the real estate mogul is only wealthy because he was born with ""a silver spoon."" Trump's father was a wealthy real estate magnate who loaned his son money to jumpstart his career. ""Litigation is nothing new to Donald Trump. Over the last decade and a half, Trump and his companies and have been sued in federal court 72 times. That doesn't take into consideration the many times he's been sued in state courts,"" Reid said. ""But Trump being the flim-flammer he is just moves on to another scam."" Reid, who is supporting Hillary Clinton, has repeatedly attacked Trump this campaign. Following Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, Reid attacked Trump's health. ""Take a look at this character that's running for president. He complains about her health. What does he do? He's 70 years old. He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit,"" Reid said last week. And on Thursday, Reid tore into Trump on the Senate floor, calling the Republican presidential nominee a ""spoiled brat,"" ""a con artist"" and a ""human leech who will bleed the country."" ",1,0,0

They rely on small spaces and dark paths for the bulk of their travel. some of these small, dark spaces include the pipes of your toilets. We’ve all seen videos of rats in toilets and you have to admit, it would be pretty frightening to stumble tiredly into your bathroom in the middle of the night and find a large rodent staring back at your from your porcelain throne.  See what I mean? Who wants to find that? Here is a video that shows how simple it is for these guys to climb up into your toilet.   If you live in a place that is rife with these furry menaces, there is something you can do to prevent them from disturbing your bathroom time. To keep rats away, install sewer pipes made of PVC or clay, at least 24 inches wide. Place a one-way rat baffle (a cap, basically), in the pipeline. And make sure any rubbish and drains are tightly sealed to stop rats congregating near your house in the first place. If you can’t do that, because you live in an apartment or some such accommodation, call your plumber and let them know you’re having rat problems and see if they can help you. ",0,0,1
514,"Washington (CNN)Ten judges on a powerful federal appeals court in Washington heard more than six hours of arguments Tuesday concerning a cornerstone of President Barack Obama's legacy on the environment: the Clean Power Plan. The Environmental Protection Agency's plan is meant to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions by targeting existing coal-fired and natural gas power plants with a goal of reduce greenhouse emissions up to 32% by 2030. It would require states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption, and it includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy. Dozens of lawyers from the government, industry and public interest groups packed the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, to hear the divisive case that comes just weeks before a heated presidential election and illustrates how a President's picks for the lower court might impact his own agenda. The plan is currently frozen because last February, the Supreme Court voted to delay implementation until the appeals process could play out. Opponents to the plan claim that the EPA went too far under the law to push the rule. Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh at one point questioned EPA's authority. ""This is a huge case,"" he said and noted that it could ""fundamentally"" transform the industry. Kavanaugh said the administration's policy is ""laudable"" but questioned under the separation of powers whether Congress, and not the EPA, had to speak clearly on the issue. Judge Thomas B. Griffith chimed in asking, ""why isn't this debate going on in the floor of the Senate?"" rather than before a panel of judges. But Judge Patricia A. Millet reiterated at one point that the Supreme Court ""has already said"" that the EPA has the authority to regulate in the area. Other judges questioned whether by 2030, the rule would be any more transformative to the coal industry, for example, than market forces would be. Judge David S. Tatel asked whether the agency was simply ""invoking existing authority."" While the morning session in court was dedicated to statutory arguments, in the afternoon the court heard arguments concerning whether it was unconstitutional. The challengers' constitutional arguments did not appear to to get much traction with the judges. On one side is the EPA, 18 states, some power companies and environmental and public health groups who argue in briefs that the rule will ""secure critically important reductions"" in carbon dioxide emissions from what are by far ""the largest emitters in the United States -- fossil-fuel-fired power plants."" They argue that the emissions ""pose a monumental threat to American's health and welfare by driving long-lasting changes in our climate leading to an array of severe negative effects."" The plan is considered important for the US to meet goals set out in a climate treaty signed in Paris last December. On the other side are nearly two dozen states, electric utilities, coal mining companies and the Chamber of Commerce. They say the rule exceeds the agency's statutory authority and goes beyond the bounds set by the Constitution. ""EPA's audacious assertion of authority in this rule is more far-reaching than any previous effort by the agency,"" lawyers for the opposing states argued in court papers. They say that the reduction requirements ""can be met only by shutting down hundreds of coal-fired plants, limiting the use of others, and requiring construction and operation of other types of facilities preferred by EPA."" In a statement back in February, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said,. ""The Clean Power Plan is based on a strong legal and technical foundation, gives states the time and flexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions, and will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy investment and jobs across the country."" By the end of the day, after more than a dozen lawyers had approached the podium, and Judge Karen Henderson acknowledged everyone's long day. ""We've all been through a marathon,"" she said. Court filled with Obama appointees During complex arguments before a multi-member court is dangerous to try to determine -- based on questions posed at oral arguments -- how a judge will ultimately rule. It's worth noting however, that Tuesday's case comes before an appellate court that has been transformed during the Obama administration. Before Obama took office the appeals court tilted toward conservative appointees with six judges nominated by a Republican president and three nominated by a Democratic president. There were also two vacancies. Currently, the active judges on the court consist of four GOP appointees and seven Democratic appointees. In 2013, Obama placed four judges on the court, three of them immediately after the Senate changed its filibuster rules. Tuesday's case was heard by all the active members of the court except for Chief Judge Merrick Garland who has recused himself from hearing cases because he has been nominated to the Supreme Court. ""The party of an appointing president surely makes a difference in some types of cases -- environmental for example -- more than others,"" said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institute. ""When the full court meets is when the party of appointing president is likely to matter most because the great majority of decisions are made by three-judge panels, randomly drawn and not necessarily reflective of the overall composition of the court."" Because the Supreme Court is currently at a reduced strength of eight the appeals court opinion could be the last word on the subject. A 4-4 tie at the Supreme Court would mean the justices automatically uphold the lower court's opinion. Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center says that the appeals court is ""exhibit A"" of why judicial nominations are crucial to a president's legacy. ""President Obama was able to put several brilliant legal minds on the bench, who are much more likely to follow the law where it leads rather than accept the extreme conservative deregulatory agenda pushed by this case,"" she said.

1158,"Gunfire and racially charged rioting have broken out again, this time in Charlotte, offering Donald Trump another chance to unabashedly sell himself as the “law and order” candidate, to side with police over African-American protesters and to rally his overwhelmingly white base. But Trump hasn’t quite done that. Story Continued Below Instead, the Republican presidential nominee delivered a more muted response as he called into Fox News Thursday morning, saying “there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black.” A day earlier, while campaigning in a black neighborhood in Cleveland, Trump defended an unarmed black man who was shot recently — and questioned the actions of the police officer who shot him. After more than a year of running one of the most racially and ethnically divisive campaigns in decades, Trump has begun to zig and zag on issues of race in the election’s final stretch. Appearing with black supporters and in black neighborhoods multiple times this month, Trump has sought to wash away the charges of racism that white nationalists have cheered. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has made casting Trump as outside-the-mainstream — she hammered Trump on The Steve Harvey Show for “bullying and bigotry” this week — one of the cornerstones of her campaign. Trump’s advisers and the candidate himself insist his concerted black outreach is a genuine effort to chip away at Democrats’ overwhelmingly margin among black voters, a group with whom he is polling in the low single digits. But Democrats, and even some skeptical Republicans, see his new tone more as an effort to make himself palatable to uneasy white voters who might otherwise be turned off by his past rhetoric. “When he asks black voters, ‘What have you got to lose, it can’t get any worse,’ he’s really just cynically talking to white voters,” said Rob Stutzman, a veteran Republican strategist and Trump critic. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks said, “I can't discern the intentions of Mr. Trump on this issue, but here's what we can say: Policy without particulars on the eve of the election insults the intelligence and sensitivities of any group.” Trump spoke most at length about the unfolding violence in Charlotte on Thursday at an energy conference in Pittsburgh, describing a “very wounded country” and national leadership vacuum that he would fill. “There is no right to engage in violent disruption,” Trump said, as Charlotte residents have taken to the streets in violent protest of the fatal shooting of a black man there. Police have fired back tear gas in intense clashes. He pitched his “law and order” approach as beneficial to black communities. “The people who will suffer most are law abiding African-American residents,” Trump said. That line was in his prepared remarks distributed by his campaign. But moments later, he ad-libbed a white stereotype of black communities. “And if you’re not aware,” Trump said, deviating from his teleprompter. “Drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night.” These days, Trump regularly tells mostly white audiences about the travesty of black neighborhoods, comparing them to war-torn places like Afghanistan. In rural North Carolina on Tuesday, Trump said that African-American communities are “absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.” On Wednesday, not long after his appearance with a Cleveland church where Trump questioned the police officer in Oklahoma who shot an unarmed black man, Terence Crutcher, Trump embraced a broad expansion “stop-and-frisk,” a controversial policing policy. By Thursday, Trump said he wasn’t backing a national policy — saying he was only referring to Chicago, despite making his comment in Cleveland. ""We've seen an expression of empathy for the loss of Mr. Crutcher's life, followed by a call for the nationalization and expansion of stop-and-frisk, preceded by a call for law and order without specifying what that means,” Brooks said. “His platform suffers from a multiple personality disorder. It's not consistent.” Still, Trump has clearly made some efforts. In Pittsburgh, Trump preached empathy. “We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes,” he said. It was an echo of none other than Clinton’s remarks after the shooting of police officers in Dallas in July. “I will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families,” Clinton said on CNN then. With all his stop-and-start black outreach, Trump appears to be honing the greatest of political skills: letting different audiences hear the same words and imbue them with different meaning. “It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing. You're seeing it, I'm seeing it. And you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it,” as he said Fox News on Thursday. “There's a — there's somewhat — and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of — there's a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something. Something's going on that's bad. And what's going on between police and others is getting worse.” The “racist” charge has deeply irked Trump’s friends and allies. Bruce LeVell, the executive director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump who traveled with him in Ohio this week, expressed frustration with the negative labels affixed to Trump. “It’s just unfair, unfortunately, what he’s had to endure,” LeVell said. “I don’t believe he’s changed his tone and tenor. Donald Trump has been clear since day one he’s for all Americans.” Trump has drawn historically low support levels in polling among African-American voters, including some swing-state surveys over the summer in Ohio and Pennsylvania that showed him with 0 percent. He has climbed from such lows, claiming his numbers are trending upward “like a rocket ship” but he remains mired in single digits in most surveys. His approval among Latinos is not much better. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News, showed Trump with 17 percent support among likely Hispanic voters — 10 points below what Mitt Romney received four years ago. Nearly 80 percent had negative feelings about Trump. Whit Ayres, a GOP pollster who has said Republicans must do better among minority groups to compete in national elections, said he couldn’t be sure who Trump’s spate of black outreach was truly targeting. “Your question assumes a level of calculation that I am not sure is warranted,” Ayres said.

1245,"While Donald Trump will top expectations, Hillary Clinton’s challenge in Monday night’s debate is to become human, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Monday. “What Hillary Clinton has to do here is she has to become human, and I mean that in a good way,” Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still getting severance from the Trump campaign, said Monday morning during a panel discussion. “She has to connect with people because I think what happens is people see her as — look, she knows the issues. There’s no question about that, but what she doesn’t have is that compassion that people see, and I think if she’s gonna be successful tonight, she has to relate to people on a different level, and the expectation of Donald Trump as not preparing, I think he’ll exceed that expectation.” Story Continued Below Lewandowski pushed back on the notion that Trump won’t be prepared for his prime-time faceoff with Clinton at Hofstra University in New York, noting that a similar narrative of an ill-prepared Trump played out during the Republican primary debates, yet the real estate mogul was actually “very prepared” and “dominated” his rivals. “Look, I think it’s the same preparation that he’s using now,” Lewandowski said of Trump’s primary debate prep, “which is conversation, talking with experts in their respective fields, understanding the issues, making sure he’s got briefing documents on issues that he wants to know more about, but he’s also prepared for the last 40 years of his life, and, you know, getting ready for a day like this is a big day for anybody. You got 100 million people, potentially, who are gonna tune in, and one of the next two people who’s gonna be president of the United States is gonna be standing on that stage tonight.

121,"While the media is focused on the horserace that will help determine politics for the next eight years, theyâre pretty much ignoring the fact that Washington is still in business and Republicans are busy being Republicans, which is to say that the rich will be getting richer while everyone else will be getting poorer. Ryan, whoâs not sure he can back Donald Trump, likely because Trump dares say the things that Republicans generally say behind closed doors, has released a new domestic plan, called, âA Better Way.â Ryan calls it his antidote to anger and division. The only problem is that if anyone pays attention to the plan, they will be angry at how he divides Americans into tax brackets, and as usual, the top tax brackets win. His plan includes a lot of Republican staples, like more military, less regulation, repealing Obamacare and deep cuts for poor people. In other words, same old cold-hearted Ayn Rand âI got mine, now f*** youâ GOP themes. Perhaps the worst part, though, is the tax plan. There are a lot of tax cuts (mostly at the cost to poor people) and nearly all of those â 99.6 percent â go to the top one percent. A typical Republican tax cut will give about 40 percent of its tax cuts to the richest one percent. Ryanâs plan, according to a new analysis by the Tax Policy Center, will give three-quarters of its tax cuts to the richest one percent in the first year. And thatâs only because the cuts are slowly phased in. By 2025, the highest-earning one percent will enjoy 99.6 percent of the tax cuts. The remaining 0.4 percent will be divided up among the other 99 percent of the country. The new Paul Ryan tax cuts make the Bush tax cuts look like socialism. Source: NY Magazine Hereâs the video:  While Ryan likes to separate himself from Donald Trump, his plan proves his policies are no less racist and classist than the worst Trump can imagine.

After all, his son Jeb didn’t do all that well during the primary campaign, and in a show of opposition to Donald Trump, no one in the Bush clan showed up at the Republican National Convention for Trump’s coronation. The Bushes themselves have remained mum on the subject of whom they’re voting for. In fact, they’ve pretty much stayed out of the presidential race altogether. But one insider says the elder Bush of 92 years will be casting his vote for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That insider is one of the late Robert F. Kennedy’s daughters, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend. She is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland. On Monday, she posted a picture of her shaking hands with Bill Clinton’s predecessor with the caption: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!”  According to Politico, Kennedy Townsend was visiting with the former President at his Maine summer home on Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport. Later in a phone interview with Politico, the Kennedy daughter confirmed, “That’s what he said.” But when pressed about it, a spokesman for Bush would neither confirm nor deny. In an email to Politico, Jim McGrath wrote, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.” Politico noted that George H.W. Bush wouldn’t be the first from his or his son’s administration to be voting for Hillary – or at least not voting for the Donald: “Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.”    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",0,0,1

1542,"There have been so many deaths in country music over the past couple of months, and we thought that we were going to have to say goodbye to another legend Saturday night. It was a normal Saturday night at the Cornstock Concert on the Hill in Garnett, Kansas until Eddie Montgomery collapsed on stage in the middle of his performance. Many of you probably know the country star from the country duo Montgomery Gentry.  Montgomery Gentry was founded in 1999 when Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry came together and graced us all with their talents. The country duo has released 6 studio albums since their big debut and has had several No. 1 hits such as “If You Ever Stop Loving Me”, “Something to Be Proud Of”, “Lucky Man”, “Back When I Knew It All” and “Roll with Me”. The duo rose to fame shortly after the start of their career and they have continued to be a country favorite over the years. The duo was performing at their concert Saturday (September 24th) when Eddie Montgomery collapsed on the stage.  The medics immediately rushed to the stage and it was just moments later that he was walking off. The concert continued as Troy Gentry lead the band out. It was just four songs later that Eddie walked back out on the stage and apparently told the audience that he was not feeling well all day and that he was very dehydrated. And just like anything else, rumors started. Fans all over were saying that Eddie had a heart attack right there on stage. Apparently, they weren’t listening or they didn’t believe that he was actually dehydrated. The next morning on the duo’s Twitter they announced that Eddie was doing well and that it was definitely not a heart attack. There are false reports floating around that Eddie had a heart attack last night. NOT TRUE. He was dehydrated and returned to the stage. — Montgomery Gentry (@mgunderground) September 25, 2016  Eddie wanted to reassure everyone that he was indeed alive and that he didn’t have a heart attack, so a couple of hours after the initial post he took it upon himself to post a photo of him and his wife. Not only that, but he made sure that all of his fans knew that he was drinking PLENTY of water – doing his best to prevent the same thing from happening again.

Here is Reagan's cheeky response, which Mondale would later describe as having effectively ended the race: ""Not at all. And, Mr. Trewhitt, I want you to know also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Lloyd Bentsen knew Jack Kennedy, then he owned Dan Quayle You can see it about 15 seconds into the clip. Vice presidential candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's brow shoots up as Dan Quayle, George H.W. Bush's 1988 running mate, answers a question about his relative inexperience, saying, ""I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency."" Bentsen fired back: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" Mondale buries the ""hatchet man"" Before he was a warmly remembered war hero who lost his own presidential race in a 1996 landslide to Bill Clinton, Bob Dole had a different kind of notoriety. During a 1976 vice presidential debate with Walter Mondale, he showed why. Asked if Watergate, and then President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, were off-limits, Dole launched into a long rant essentially blaming ""Democrat wars"" for killing millions of Americans. Mondale hit back with one line: ""I think Sen. Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight."" Perot sets himself apart With his Texas twang, Ross Perot made a serious dent in the 1992 presidential race. Here he underlines why his lack of experience in government was going to be a political asset: ""I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done."" Lincoln prints and publishes his debate zingers Though the words were spoken during one of their celebrated 1858 Senate debates, Abraham Lincoln was so pleased with his performance against Stephen A. Douglas, he took the transcripts (which he edited, liberally, on his own) and published them in a book before their 1860 presidential rematch. In arguing that Douglas was using a flimsy principle as a bogus pretext for spreading slavery nationwide, Lincoln mockingly asked what remained of the substance of his rival's position: ""Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?"" Gore questions (the first) Bush's resume Al Gore was running for vice president in 1992, but that didn't mean he wasn't aiming high. Here is the shot he took at George H.W. Bush, who had sought to attach his record to that of his former boss Reagan, during a three-way debate with Dan Quayle and Adm. James Stockdale: ""George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise."" Bush shakes off Gore Sometimes, words are unnecessary. At 11:58 in this clip, early on in his debate with Al Gore, George W. Bush responds to the vice president's ill-timed stroll and apparent attempt to intimidate him with a simple -- but devastating -- silent shake of his head. ",1,0,0
1504,"The black man, Keith Lamont Scott, who was shot by a black police officer in North Carolina, was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing. He got back in the car and then got back out again, brandishing the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way. The officer shot and killed Scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers. Scott’s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that Scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon. Now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney. Sounds like a justified shooting to me. They lied about the book and ginned up riots there. Then they had a Muslim spokesman come in and incite violence. They should all be arrested as far as I’m concerned.  From Young Conservatives: The family of Keith Lamont Scott, the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon, said “no comment” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right. If that isn’t an admission then their lawyer wouldn’t have told them to say “no comment.” Clearly, the video must’ve shown that Scott was not obeying police officers (which we already know to be the case). Had the family’s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line, they would’ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder. Tell me I’m wrong. I’m not, but you can tell me anyways. These riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt, but police officers as well. An emergency was declared by the governor and the National Guard had to come in. These riots will carry a heavy price tag. The police chief says there is no definitive proof in the video that Scott aimed the gun at the officers. It doesn’t matter. He had it in his hand and would not drop it. The officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out. That is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video. They saw that Scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down.

1108,"A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father’s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case it’s not Donald Trump. It’s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot. Like Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia’s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump’s strongest states. Story Continued Below West Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49–31 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders’ 51 percent in the state’s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win. That’s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia’s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It’s very nearly the opposite of what’s happening in other states with close races. “Across the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it’s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,” says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “This is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.” In this race, Trump isn’t a drag on Republicans; he’s an asset. The reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with “war on coal” rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It’s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia’s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price. Cole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he’s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools. In a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket. “If you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,” says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. “If you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known—the wall, universal health care, the coal industry—but so much of what’s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.” Justice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He’s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won’t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole’s claim that he supports Obama as “complete dog snot.” And while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate “isn’t focused on the national political circus,” the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. “Jim is no politician,” says Herring. “He is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.” At the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent. Many doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. “Do I think Justice has a lead? Yes,” says Gates. “Do I think it’s double digits? No.” Some of that is because Justice’s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP’s otherwise effective “war on coal” messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields. “If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says Dave “Mudcat” Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he’s voting for Trump, says voters don’t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. “She said she’s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don’t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.” If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says one Democratic strategist. But Saunders doesn’t have kind words for Justice either: “He’s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.” Cole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice’s business record over the next several weeks. “Jim Justice is a coal operator, but he’s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,” Gates says. “His legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.” That record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice “stands out” among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down. The problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice’s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That’s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million. The pattern apparently extends to Justice’s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court. Justice’s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election. Both Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that’s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry. According to the U.S. Census, West Virginia’s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy. Mines sit idle as a string of industry giants— Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy—filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it’s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal. The coal industry’s struggles haven’t just hurt West Virginia’s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward. Justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he’s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints’ training camp to the Greenbrier. In late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Justice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier’s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment. Whether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato’s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor’s race from “Leans Republican” to “Toss-up.” “We’re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,” Kondik says. Trump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor’s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That’s why Cole’s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal “war on coal.” Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn’t matter, so long as they’re not voting for Justice. In his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: “At the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what’s best for Jim Justice.” That line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what’s in Justice and Trump’s best interests is in theirs, too.",1,0,0
410,"Washington (CNN)Two Republican senators are expressing concern to the head of the Department of Homeland Security over what they said was a ""rush"" to process new citizens ahead of the presidential election. In the letter to Jeh Johnson, Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin specifically suggest that new voters could provide Democrats with an advantage. They refer to an internal agency email from US Citizenship and Immigration Services about processing applications ""due to the election year."" The memo encourages DHS staff to work overtime to process applications and notes several Saturdays that offices will be open to help process applications. The senators say a similar effort in 1996 to increase citizenship applications ""endangered national security and public safety"" because not all the cases were processed following the correct protocol, such as fingerprint checks. The Department of Homeland Security said it aims to ensure naturalization applications are processed on time. ""USCIS's goal is to process applications for naturalization within five to seven months, regardless of external events such as elections. USCIS uses statistical forecasting models to plan for the potential increased volume of work. USCIS anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, as we usually see in an election year, but the increase ... has exceeded expectations,"" Homeland Security said in a statement. The prospect of more immigrants becoming citizens likely stands to benefit Democrats. The implications are controversial because Democrats have made a push to get new immigrants to register to vote, aiming to build up an anti-Trump demographic particularly among Latinos. Latinos line up to get naturalized and stop Trump US Citizenship and Immigration Services show a 14.5% jump in naturalization applications in June-December of 2015 compared with the same six months in the previous year. Federal data does not break down those applications by race, but grass-roots organizations, like the Florida Immigrant Coalition, say their naturalization drives across their swing state are filled primarily by Latinos, who overwhelmingly vote Democrat.

1281,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump wasted little time going for each other's jugulars Monday, each stampeding over the other's talking points as their intensely anticipated first debate began. Each candidate knows that the perception of their performance — from their command of policy issues and ability to articulate a vision for the country to their ability to parry barbs and attacks from their rival — could set the trajectory for the rest of the campaign. Here are the most memorable and important moments of the night: Story Continued Below 1) Trump: Clinton doesn’t look presidential Trump reiterated that Clinton “doesn’t have the look” of a president and said “she doesn’t have the stamina.” Clinton had a quick rebuke. “Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.” Clinton attempted to turn the topic back to Trump’s derogatory comments toward women, invoking a beauty pageant contestant she claimed Trump had called “Ms. Piggy” and “Ms. Housekeeping.” “Donald, she has a name,” Clinton said, as Trump interjected, saying, “Where did you find this?” Trump argued that his comments were largely aimed at Rosie O’Donnell (who he had a long running feud with) and then he offered a subtle suggestion he had considered invoking of the Clintons’ marital strife – including her husband’s infidelity. “I said to myself, I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice,” he said. “But she's (spent) hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads even me, many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.” 2) Trump to Americans on racial healing: 'I say nothing' As Holt pressed Trump on his role in perpetuating the birther controversy against President Barack Obama, he asked Trump what he’d say to Americans about the need for racial healing. “I say nothing,” Trump replied, “because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate]. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.” Trump struggled to respond to charges that he fomented the debunked claim that Obama was born outside the United States for years after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate. Instead, he reiterated his claim that Clinton’s own advisers pushed the controversy during their divisive primary in 2008. “I'll tell you just simple to say, Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patty Doyle went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against president Obama fought very hard, and you can go look it up and you can check it out,” he said. “If you look at CNN this past week, Patty Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened, Blumenthal sent McClatchy to Kenya to find out about it, they were pressing very hard. They failed to get the birth certificate.” “I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job,” he continued, adding of Clinton, “just like she can't bring back jobs she can't produce.” 3) The fact check fight As Donald Trump excoriated Hillary Clinton for once describing the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the ""gold standard"" of trade deals, Clinton shot back that he was mischaracterizing her position against the deal. ""I know you live in your own reality, but those are not the facts,"" she said. Soon after, she plugged her home page and urged viewers to visit her campaign's live Trump fact check. Trump cut in to plug his own website next. After a tussle over taxes, Trump fired back. ""Look at her website. It's no different than this,"" he said. ""She's telling us how to fight ISIS. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think general MacArthur would like that too much."" Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton for the Obama administration's fiscal policies. She again retorted. ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened,"" she said. ""Why not?"" he mused. ""Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things,"" she said. 4) Paying no income tax 'makes me smart' Trump parried a question about his still-hidden tax returns by vowing emphatically to release them as soon as Clinton produces 33,000 deleted emails from her private server. ""I will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted,"" he said. ""As soon as she releases them, I will release my tax returns and that's against my lawyers say don't do it."" The audience broke into cheers, violating the rules of decorum set out by moderator Lester Holt. Clinton replied that Trump's comment was ""another example of bait and switch here."" ""You've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings,"" she said, adding that he may not have paid any income tax. ""That makes me smart,"" he interjected. 5) Trump defends business practices After Clinton slammed Trump for ""stiffing"" his workers and bringing companies into bankruptcy, Trump defended his dealings. ""Look, it's all words. It's all sound bites,"" he said. ""I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets in the world beyond the United States and it's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there."" As for Clinton's contention about his workers, Trump said: ""First of all, they did get paid a lot but taking advantage of the laws of the nation. ... Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company."" Trump also seemed to contemplate losing the presidential race, noting the hotel he just opened on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. ""If I don't get there in one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Ave. another,"" he said. 6) Trump hints at Clinton’s stamina Trump attempted to stoke his campaign’s insinuation that Clinton lacks the stamina to be president. In a discussion of his travels to urban areas to speak to African American voters, Trump noted he’d been to Detroit and Philadelphia. “You've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's okay,” he said. Clinton counterpunched. “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” she said. “And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing."" 7) Trump to Clinton: 'We agree.' The first interaction of the night wasn't the haymaker many people expected. Trump's first comment directed at Clinton was about an area of agreement: Child care. ""As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that,"" Trump said after Clinton opened with a call for more family friendly economic policies. ""We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do but perhaps we'll be talking about that later."" 8) Trump continues to mislead on his Iraq war stance Trump continued to mislead on his position on the Iraq War, insisting that he was against it prior to the invasion despite the only evidence – a 2002 Howard Stern interview – suggesting he was in favor of it. “I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her,” Trump said of Clinton. “The record shows otherwise,” Holt said. Trump urged reporters to call Fox’s Sean Hannity, a close ally, to vouch for his opposition to the war beforehand. Clinton said she hoped “fact checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.” 9) Clinton laughs off Trump’s temperament barb Trump, who’s been dogged by questions about his temperament to be president, sought to turn the issue around on Clinton, saying she’s actually too volatile. Trump said that at the AFL-CIO “the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, secretary, Clinton, but you were totally out of control,” he said. Clinton grinned and delivered an exasperated “Woo! Okay.” Her voice trailed off and she moved on. 10) Trump backs off “rigged” suggestions Trump poured cold water on the notion that he might challenge the results of the presidential election. “If she wins, I will absolutely support her,” he said. Clinton set the table for Trump’s walkback by saying that in democracy, “sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.”",1,0,0
609,"On Monday, Donald Trump gave a speech in Estero, Florida that focused on the latest terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. He used it to give a blistering indictment of President Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for their feckless handling of the Middle East and Islamic terrorism in general-which they are unable or unwilling to even name. As usual, the Clinton-Obama conglomeration (for lack of a better word) came out with their typically vanilla response to the above terrorist attacks. White House spokesman Josh Earnest came out with yet another boffo explanation that we are in a “war of narratives with ISIS.” Clinton stated on Sunday that it would be wise not to speak out before all the facts were in (I am paraphrasing), and that we needed to “steel our resolve” whatever that means. Then on Monday she stated that  Trump’s rhetoric was giving aid and comfort to the enemy, a form of treason, no less. “Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant for ISIS,” Clinton said on Monday morning. “The kind of language and rhetoric Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.”  Yes, Hillary. All these atrocities are happening because of Trump’s rhetoric. There is no doubt that Trump is going to at least give us a feel for how he is going to battle Islamic terror. He already has given us some in his references to limiting Muslim immigration. Now that he has “modified” it by talking about “extreme vetting,” Clinton has jumped on the bandwagon saying that she has always supported enhanced vetting – this as she actively supports a dramatic increase in Syrian refugees – over five times as many as Obama’s 10,000. Trump, for his part, while not telegraphing our moves to the enemy, needs to let us know something about his military intentions. My sense is that he will try to bring NATO and our Arab allies together into a fighting force that will go into Syria, Iraq and Libya to destroy the ISIS army in the air and on the ground. That done, it is up to the West to take whatever steps we can to keep ISIS terrorists out of our lands. It goes without saying that our immigration policies must be drastically revised. (In Europe, it may be too late.) I truly think that the majority of the American people – while not wanting to massively violate the rights of American Muslims – are not happy with our government’s responses to Islamic terror, even more so as we are attacked on our own soil. Hillary Clinton plainly promises more of the same if elected. They know that Islamic terrorists are at war with us and intend to carry out that war on our own streets. While not painting all Muslims with the same brush, it is clear to all that terrorists are walking among us. We know that future attacks are being planned as we speak. By various estimates, the current Muslim population in the US is around 1%. That amounts to a few million people, who are immigrants, naturalized American citizens, or younger people actually born here. Forget about mass roundups, deportations or internments. We can adopt a zero-tolerance policy for non-citizens who violate our laws and kick them out, but by and large, it will be up to law enforcement and the courts to remove the terrorists and plotters from our midst. In the meantime, that 1%  must not be allowed to grow. If we are having these problems at 1%, what do you think it will be like at 5% or 10% or higher? Far beyond a religion, this is a political ideology that is incompatible with our constitution – a belief system, if you will. We once kept communists from entering the US based on their belief system, which would have subverted our democracy.  We need to find a way to do it again – if for no other reason than to protect our citizens from harm. Trump wants to find a way to accomplish that. If Trump handles this issue sensibly, it can be a winner for him. Without castigating an entire community, all he has to do is talk about Hillary’s failures and reluctance to go beyond what she and Obama have already done (or not done) in responding to Islamic terror – which they won’t even name. However, he also has to convince us he has a concrete plan to destroy ISIS and protect the American people.

These moves will significantly improve travel for the media covering Trump, who last week were left behind when reporters got stuck in New York City traffic trying to get a different airport than the one Trump, whose motorcade cuts through traffic, was flying out of for an event in New Hampshire. Despite requests to wait for the traveling press, Trump started the event without his traveling press corps and mocked them for being late. Reporters will travel with Trump on his plane ""when logistically feasible,"" the campaign said, according to one member of Trump's traveling press corps. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, when asked whether the improved logistics were in reaction to last week's problems, said the move ""has been in the works for weeks."" Neither campaign has a full protective pool, meaning reporters cover the candidate as the president is covered by the White House press corps, from leaving their residence to return. Hillary Clinton's press corps have a quasi-protective pool, and have been traveling with her on her plane and within her motorcade since the Labor Day holiday. However, her press corps is not with her at all times as was evidenced earlier this month when Clinton fell ill and left a 9/11 memorial service early, leaving the press corps behind and without information for nearly two hours.",1,0,0
112,"Donald Trump appeared on Â Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees, a lack of profiling by law enforcement, and the First Amendment. Conservatives always go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second. Trump took aim at refugees; however, bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, is a naturalized citizen. A Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop âpeople who are radicalized here.âÂ Trump responded to that by saying âfreedom of the pressâ was to blame. âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw,â Trump said. âThey tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. Instead they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.ââ âThe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. Theyâre inciting violence, okay?â he continued. âTheyâre making violence possible. They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Watch at around the 21 minute mark: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTRabASaY8] However, incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment. Think Progress reports: Itâs a high bar to proveâââfor which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful. Under a laxer rule, itâs possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself. In August, his statement that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could be able to do something about Hillary Clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat. On Friday, he called for Clintonâs bodyguards to âdisarm immediately,â adding âletâs see what happens to her.â Donald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times. Most recently, his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested. The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists. Trump said of Putin after being confronted by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leaderâs bloody history with journalists, âHeâs running his country, and at least heâs a leader. Unlike what he have in this country.â Freedom of the Press is part of our Constitution. Itâs not up for debate, unless Melania Trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source. But if you ask Donald Trump Jr., heâll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks. Ironically, Juniorâs pinned tweet reads, âLiberals love the first amendment until you say something they donât agree with.â He really should change that. ",0,1,0
1388,"Bill Clinton has a slew of ex-girlfriends who I’m sure want to take a shot at Hillary, but one of them is actually doing it. Once you listen to what he has to say about Mrs. Clinton and the reason she believes Hillary is having suddenly noticeable health problems, you’re going to find yourself agreeing. Dolly Kyle, who I had never heard of before right now, is the author of Hillary: The Other Woman and has a long, sordid past with the Former President of the United States Bill Clinton. The book details some horrible interactions with the Clintons, including a situation where Hillary actually blew up at a group of handicapped children while serving as the First Lady of Arkansas.  Kyle may have hit the nail on the head with her keen analysis of the Hillary Clinton health issue. “I really think she has been ’cruisin’ for a bruisin’, as we say in the South, because she’s such an angry person and so driven by this inner rage,” said Kyle. “People like that eventually break down, physically.” But, she asserts, Hillary’s “inability to keep her lies straight” is not necessarily attributed to her anger, but “cognitive impairment.” I can’t say that I disagree. I’ve known several people who are just hateful and angry and they have a tendency to suffer from more physical ailments than the rest of us. Of course this isn’t going to be true of all people, but I have personally noticed a correlation between angry people and mental issues. But Kyle says that anger is not the only strong emotion Clinton feels. “That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” warned Kyle. “I call her ‘Hillary Scissorhands’ because of her predilection for destroying records which could get in the way of her goals.” I recommend buying Dolly’s book if you don’t already have it, because it is a disturbingly deep look into the behaviors of a woman who may very well become the next President of the United States. And with so many people, including former Secret Service agents, telling stories similar to the ones that Kyle has written about, there has to be some measure of truth to them. Do you think that Clinton’s health issues may be related to her behavior and attitude as a person? Let us know in the comments of our Facebook page! ",0,0,1
980,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has withdrawn his lawsuit against the Obama administration over the state’s law that curbs legal protections for transgender people. Lawyers for McCrory said in a court filing on Friday that North Carolina was dropping the lawsuit, citing “substantial costs” to the state. They wrote that continuing the litigation is unnecessary since North Carolina will have the chance to defend its transgender law, known as HB2, as part of a separate lawsuit that the Justice Department has brought against the state. Story Continued Below McCrory initially filed the lawsuit in May after the Obama administration threatened to withhold federal funding to the state because of the law, which requires transgender people to use public restrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity. The Justice Department countered with its own lawsuit against North Carolina, filed hours later. That case remains ongoing. The voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit on Friday won’t bring the debate over the legality of North Carolina’s law to an end anytime soon. And the question of transgender bathroom access continues to spark lawsuits around the country. Federal judges have ruled in different directions on the issue, which may ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge last month ordered the University of North Carolina to let two transgender students and one employee use bathrooms that align with their gender identities. But a federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked the Obama administration from enforcing its directive that schools allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match with their gender identity.",1,0,0

538,"Hillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. Once again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which makes it a felony to ‘conceal’ or ‘harbor’ any ‘alien’ ‘including any means of transportation.’ The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for “commercial advantage or private financial gain,” could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti-Trump speech. From Fox News: Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented “Dreamers” into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump’s immigration plans could result in their deportation – though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote.   Clinton’s national voter registration program, called “Mi Sueño, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,” was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee.  ",0,0,1
1512,"Toby Keith has been forced to cancel his show in South Carolina and it was totally unexpected. Toby Keith was scheduled to perform at the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina on September 22 and he was forced to cancel. Unfortunately the night before the concert Toby Keith sent out an update to all of his fans sharing the heartbreaking news.  The good news is that Toby Keith didn’t have to cancel his concert because he was ill or hurt. The bad news is that there are huge fuel shortages in South Carolina and the gas prices are continuing to rise in the Southeast. The General Manager of the Florence Civic Center,Kendall Wall, shared that the venue had received many messages from fans stating that they weren’t going to be able to make it because of the fuel cancern. Both Keith’s managers and the Florence Civic center decided that it was best for the fans if the concert was postponed to a later date. They wanted it to be fair for everyone who had already purchased their tickets. “This is a major show for the region which attracts fans within a one- to two-hour drive and beyond…We understand the growing concerns for Toby’s fans and our own fans, as we’ve been receiving distress messages over the past couple days…It would be unfair for these fans and unrealistic for them to travel given the current dismal situation with gas prices and availability.”  The rescheduled concert date is March 7,2017 and the tickets will be honored for that concert. If any fan is unable to make the rescheduled concert date, there will be refunds made but only for a short amount of time. Toby Keith is one of the most respected country artists and we hope that those fans who could have made the concert are understanding of the cancelation.  I’m glad that everyone is okay, but it is such a bummer that these things have to happen. Pray for South Carolina!",0,0,1
1128,"Donald Trump doubled down on his call for implementation of stop-and-frisk Thursday — but only in Chicago. The Republican presidential nominee suggested the controversial stop-and-frisk policy to mitigate violent crime in America’s inner cities during an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity broadcast Wednesday evening. Story Continued Below On Thursday, he clarified that he was only referring to enacting it in Chicago, where he said more than 3,000 shootings have taken place this year. “I was really referring to Chicago with stop-and-frisk,” he told “Fox and Friends” during a phone interview Thursday morning. “They asked me about Chicago and I was talking about stop-and-frisk for Chicago.” But while Trump scaled down where stop-and-frisk should be deployed, the self-proclaimed law-and-order candidate hardly softened his stance on the policing practice that studies have shown is biased. He cited New York, where a federal court ruled the practice unconstitutional in 2013 because it disproportionately impacts people of color (though an appeals court overturned the ruling, and the city eventually settled), as evidence that it works. “I mean, the numbers were unbelievably changed,” he said of crime statistics before and after New York implemented stop-and-frisk. “I don’t mean just a little bit. It was massively changed, and it became a safe city. It went from an unsafe city to a safe city.” Trump highlighted Chicago as a city that’s “out of control” right now but where stop-and-frisk is a necessity that can save the city from itself, suggesting it’s more dangerous to be there than in war-torn nations like Afghanistan. “I think Chicago needs stop-and-frisk,” Trump said. “Now, people can criticize me for that or people can say whatever they want, but they asked me about Chicago, and I think stop-and-frisk, with good, strong, you know, good, strong law and order. But you have to do something. It can’t continue the way it’s going.” David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, blasted Trump’s “problematic” rhetoric — even if he was only referring to Chicago. “That’s like taking a can of kerosene and pouring it over a fire,” he said of Trump’s call for stop-and-frisk during an interview with CNN. “It wasn’t what was needed.” Trump shared his denotation of the term, first explaining that “there are different levels” to stop-and-frisk. “Basically, they will, if they see poss… — you know, they’re proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun, they will see the person, and they’ll look and they’ll take the gun away,” Trump said. “They’ll stop, they’ll frisk, and they’ll take the gun away, and they won’t have anything to shoot with. I mean, how it’s not being used in Chicago is, to be honest with you, it’s quite unbelievable. And, you know, the police, the local police, they know who has a gun, who shouldn’t be having a gun. They understand that.” Trump’s definition, however, excluded any racial bias — at a time when the nation is already reeling from a series of fatal shootings of black men at the hands of police officers just days apart, marked by unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency Wednesday evening. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump surrogate, hailed the practice as a strategy that reduced crime and is the solution to reducing gun violence. “Because it takes the gun right out of your hand,” said Giuliani, who added that no one is taking guns away in New York or Chicago “because bad guys don’t go register” guns. “You know, ‘Fat Tony’ Salerno doesn’t go get a gun permit. Neither does the hood on the street go get a permit,” he continued. “You know why? There’s probably a warrant for his arrest and he’s gonna go to jail. So he doesn’t get a permit.” Trump contended that “you can’t let the system go the way it’s going,” adding that “some people” think stop-and-frisk is “a great idea, and some people probably don’t like it” — New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is of the latter group. De Blasio condemned stop-and-frisk, insisting that it “created a real wedge between police and community and created division.” De Blasio credited “a systematic strategic approach to policing,” not stop-and-frisk, for reduced crime in New York. “You know, Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts. He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety,” de Blasio told CNN. “He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to respond to Trump's comments. ""I think it does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting second amendment rights yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against an illegal search and seizure,"" he said. ""It might lead one person to conclude that the politician is more interested in playing politics than finding a solution."" But Earnest made sure to note that stop-and-frisk is not the type of practice the administration and its allies support. ""Expanding and doubling down on stop and frisk policies is not among the suggestions, I think for rather obvious reasons."" Brent Griffiths contributed to this story.",1,0,0
1232,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton. Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island. Story Continued Below That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues. “She shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,” said a Nevada Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.” “The media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,” a New Hampshire Democrat added. “Presidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.” One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee. “Hillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,” said the Ohio Democrat. “She will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.” Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states. “Somehow she needs to reverse the trend,” said an Ohio Republican. “Never seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance — and maybe her last chance.” “She has to stop [Trump’s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,” added a Virginia Republican. “All [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.” Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure — 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans — most pointed to the GOP nominee’s volatile personality. “Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,” said a Michigan Republican. “The pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.” “The question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?” added a Michigan Democrat. “Can he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?” Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey: Most insiders expect Clinton to “win” the debate. Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans. “Media look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,” said an Iowa Republican. “[Clinton’s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,” added a New Hampshire Democrat. But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton — or the media through which voters will interpret the debate. “The press wants Trump to win,” said a Florida Democrat. “Their disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.” Some Republicans also claimed media bias — in the other direction. “The media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,” a Virginia Republican said. “But then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.” Insiders think the debate will matter. Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates. Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don’t expect the debate to move the needle. “Trump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),” a Michigan Democrat predicted. “The moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.” The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn’t have a significant impact. “Trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,” said a New Hampshire Republican. “He does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.” But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump’s momentum with a strong performance Monday night. “If she pins his ears back, [it helps her],” said an Iowa Republican. “If it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.” Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race. “We're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,” an Iowa Republican said. “Swing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.” Added a Florida Democrat: “Does a damn thing matter this year? I think not.” These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey: Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer Florida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

1083,"Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday ripped into President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for a ""dereliction of duty"" in their efforts to combat terrorism, while calling the Bush administration's failure to come to grips with the threat before the Sept. 11 attacks ""excusable."" Writing in USA Today, the former New York City mayor and current Donald Trump surrogate accused Obama and Clinton of investing “too much time and energy into the narrative that there is no ongoing War on Terror.” Story Continued Below He argued that Obama and his former secretary of state had responded inadequately to the recent violence — including the planted bombs in New York and New Jersey — and underestimated the threat of terrorism to the country generally. “Obama and Clinton continue to ignore the reality that a worldwide terror campaign is being deliberately executed by the very people they refuse to define: radical Islamic terrorists,” Giuliani wrote. “Obama and Clinton's gut reaction is to tell the American people that we’re defeating the Islamic State terrorist group abroad while systematically downplaying connections between radical Islam and attackers in the United States and Europe.” While Clinton first urged officials to “let this investigation unfold” after hearing reports of an explosion in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York on Saturday, Trump emphatically declared it a bomb and then boasted when authorities later confirmed the planted explosive devices. (Clinton, however, also made reference to ""bombings"" in her initial statements.) Republicans have also repeatedly criticized Obama for arguing against using the term ""radical Islamic terrorism"" for the Islamic State and its sympathizers. Clinton previously refrained from repeating the term, but has since used the words ""radical Islamism"" to describe the threat in the wake of the mass shooting in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June. Also faulting its withdrawal of troops from Iraq and blaming the move for the rise of the Islamic State, Giuliani argued that the Obama administration fails to “comprehend the threats before us today,” which he charged is a “clear dereliction of duty.” Giuliani had warmer words for Obama’s predecessor, however, suggesting that the Bush administration’s ""failure to fully comprehend the threat before Sept. 11 is excusable.""",1,0,0
47,"Donald Trump and his children have for years promoted themselves and their real estate opportunities in Russia and other former Soviet states, and ethics experts say if he is elected President the get-tough U.S. sanctions against Russia could be in direct conflict with his business interests. Trump has said he will not participate in decisions about his business if he is elected to the White House and that those decisions will be left to his children in what they have called a “blind trust.” But Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as ethics advisor to Republican President George W. Bush, said the arrangement would not fit his definition of a blind trust, and appeared ripe for potential conflicts. “I don’t see how you have a blind trust when you know what’s in the blind trust,” Painter told ABC News. “The appearance is that a foreign government or other foreign organization has influence over the president of the United States through financial dealings with his family and that would be unacceptable.” As questions have been raised about Trump’s business interests with Russians, the candidate has sought to distance himself from Moscow. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,” he wrote on Twitter in July. He later told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, “Will I sell condos to Russians on occasion? Probably. I mean I do that. I have a lot of condos. I do that. But I have no relationship to Russia whatsoever."" But an ABC News investigation found he has numerous connections to Russian interests both in the U.S. and abroad. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars -- what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen,” said Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group and who says he once helped market Trump’s U.S. condos in Russia and the former Soviet states. “They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump.” Questions about Trump’s posture towards Russia have been a recurring issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. They have come from Democrats and Republicans, many of whom expressed surprise at Trump’s flattering remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as the official U.S. stance has grown increasingly frosty. “I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly, but there’s nothing I can think of that I’d rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries,” he said.   Sen. John McCain told a talk radio audience he was “astonished” after Trump praised Putin on the campaign trail. “I think [it] shows either profound ignorance or an attitude that contradicts everything about the United States of America and our relations with our adversaries,” McCain said.  Long before he ran for president, Trump displayed an ongoing interest in Russia and the former Soviet states. He negotiated projects in the Republic of Georgia and Azerbaijan, neither of which was completed. And he and his children at different times toured Moscow in search of a site for a Trump project there. “I know there were some drafts prepared for the [Moscow real estate] project when Donald Trump flew to Moscow. And he shared those drafts with some of the Russian businessmen,” Millian said, adding, “It didn't go any further at the moment.” Trump was involved in a range of deals with Russian-born business executives, including the developer of the Trump project in Toronto. One of his partners in Trump Soho recruited financing from investors in Russia and Kazakhstan, according to court filings. And in 2013, Trump earned a cut of the proceeds when a Russian oligarch paid to host the Miss Universe Pageant at his venue in Moscow.   At the same time, wealthy Russians accounted for significant profits at Trump projects in the U.S.. Throughout the 2000s, records show Russians were buying into Trump branded real estate. ABC News conducted a review of hundreds of pages of property records and found that Trump-branded developments catered to large numbers of Russian buyers. This was most notable at the Trump licensed condo towers in Hollywood and Sunny Isles, Florida. Local real estate agents credited the Russian migration for turning the coastal Miami community into what they called “Little Moscow.” Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten told ABC News the firm does not track the nationality of buyers, but he does not believe Russians spent any more money on Trump ventures than those from other regions. “This whole fascination with this connection is overblown and misleading,” Garten said. Garten said the Trump Organization played no part in determining which market to pursue – the strategy used to attract buyers was entirely the purview of the developer. “In a license deal we’re not selling the unit,” Garten added. “That is a contact between the developer of that project and the buyer. We’re not selling anyone anything.” In the case of the Trump towers along Florida’s coast, they were sold by two separate builders with Trump licensing his name to the projects. But the licensing agreements required Trump to participate in the marketing of the condos, and Trump received royalties for each unit sold, according to Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development, which built six Trump buildings in Sunny Isles. “He [Trump] obviously benefits from each apartment sold,” Dezer said. “There was a licensing percentage there.” Dezer described Trump’s hands-on approach to the projects, with involvement in every detail of the construction. “He would come in and he knew exactly what he would want,” Dezer said.  There is ample evidence in Russian media from that period in the 2000s that brokers mounted a significant effort to attract buyers to Trump properties in Florida, Toronto and New York. And Trump and his children participated in those campaigns. During the marketing of the Trump SoHo project, in which Trump licensed his name to a group that included Russian investors, the Trump family met with a group of Russian journalists at their New York offices to help boost interest in the project, according to Russian media reports. During the meeting, Trump was quoted telling the gathering of Russian journalists: “I really like Vladimir Putin. I respect him. He does his work well. Much better than our Bush.” Eric Trump and Donald Jr. were also present, and were quoted praising the importance of Russian condo buyers, many of whom have purchased units in Trump buildings in seven-figure, cash-only deals. ""As the experience of the past few years shows, the best property buyers now are Russian,” Eric Trump is quoted as saying. “They're different in that they can go around without a mortgage loan from American banks, that require income checks and they can buy apartments with cash.” Garten said the Trump Organization did not fly Russian journalists to New York to tout the SoHo project, or any other. “If such a trip took place it would have likely been arranged by the developer or the broker for the project - not us,” he said.  Victoria Shtainer, a New York real estate agent who specializes in the high-end market, said the interest from Russian buyers rose in the early 2000s as Russians started to accrue wealth and began looking for a safe place to move their money. “They felt that the United States is a place where they could park their money and have their children go to school and have a future here,” she said. “America has always been the dream.” Advertisements began appearing in Russian media. Real estate agents marketing Trump projects showed glossy photos of the Florida oceanfront properties, such as one licensed development called Trump Hollywood. “An exclusive location on the Gold Coast,” read the Russian subtitles on one online video. “Excellence is felt in every look and every touch.” Daniel Pansky, a Florida broker who specializes in Russian buyers, said the Trump branded was uniquely suited to Russian buyers, who equated his name with luxury. As sales piled up, “Sunny Isles developed into a Little Moscow,” he said. “A lot of local dry cleaners, restaurants, stores having menus and signs in Russian.” “The Trump brand basically started the branding game here in south Florida,” said Pansky. “The majority of clientele were from New York and Russian origin.” But Pansky and Shtainer told ABC News that purchases from Russian buyers in New York and Miami began to drop precipitously in 2014, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the Russian military incursion into Crimea. To Russian buyers looking to move money out of their home country, Shtainer explained, the sanctions “basically cut off their oxygen.”  Should Trump come out on top in the elections in November, he has said he'll consider whether or not to lift sanctions on Russia. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking,” Trump responded in July when asked if he would roll sanctions back. Hope Hicks, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said the Republican nominee has ""never issued a position on the matter one way or another"" and reiterated that he would be studying the issue. Trump's children said that if their father becomes president, they would abide by the ""blind trust"" and not talk business with him. “And we'll act incredibly responsibly and my father already said that he would put the company into a blind trust and it would be run by us,” Ivanka Trump told ABC News last week. Donald Trump Jr. said his father would not be told about their deals: “We're not going to discuss those things. We're just, it doesn't matter. Trust me.” Millian said he hopes Trump continues to pursue closer ties between the U.S. and Russia. He recently posted a Trump donation card on his Instagram feed. “He knows that a lot of Russians love his properties,” Millian said. “They buy his luxury residences. So it was a good, very good business for him.” ABC News' Randy Kreider, Cho Park, and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report.",1,0,0
823,"Don’t stop sharing this until it’s burned into everyone’s minds what cops go through everyday. Don’t stop sharing this until EVERY American understands that sometimes officers have to make the most difficult decision of their lives… To fire on a suspect who they believe might try to kill them. WARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEO OF AN OFFICER’S DEATH BELOW Kyle Dinkheller was a deputy with the Laurens County Sheriff’s Department in Georgia. He was 22 years old when he was killed in the line of duty. Dinkheller’s story, and the video that captured his death have been part of police training for 15 years. The extremely graphic video which also captured Dinkheller’s screams as he was shot 9 times, with a 10th and final fatal shot to his eye, is evidence as to why officers do not have the luxury of hesitating when confronted with a suspect who is disobeying orders. It was on Monday, January 12, in 1998 when Dinkheller pulled over Andrew Howard Brannan for going almost 100 miles an hour near the town of Dudley, Georgia. The stop was uneventful, initially. When Dinkheller pulled Brannan over, Brannan exited his vehicle, and the two greeted each other. Brannan put his hands in his pockets shortly after. Deputy Dinkheller asked Brannan to keep his hands in plain sight. That’s when the encounter went south. Brannan became agitated, told Dinkheller to shoot him, and then began dancing crazily on the road. Dinkheller radioed for backup, and ordered Brannan to desist and approach his police cruiser. Brannan then rushed the deputy in an extremely hostile manner. Dinkheller used his baton to keep Brannan from reaching him. That’s when the suspect retreated towards his Toyota pickup truck. Brannan reached inside of his truck even though Dinkheller ordered him not to do so. The suspect then produced an M1 carbine rifle. Dinkheller can be heard repeatedly yelling at Brannan to “put the gun down now!” Deputy Dinkheller continued telling Brannan to drop his weapon for about 30 seconds. That’s when Brannan opened fire. Bullets can be seen hitting Dinkheller’s cruiser’s window in the video. Dinkheller returned fire, but did not hit Brannan. With his magazine empty, Dinkheller was forced to reload. It was at this point that Brannan rushed the deputy and began to fire at him at close range. Dinkheller, hit several times, is heard screaming in terror saying “Sh-t! Sh-t! Stop now!” Brannan then ran to the front of Dinkheller’s cruiser and reloaded his weapon. Dinkheller fired a shot at Brannan, at which point Brannan rushed the deputy while firing his rifle. Dinkheller was hit several times. The 22-year-old’s screams are difficult to listen to. Returning fire, one of the deputy’s bullets did in fact find its target, hitting Brannan in the stomach, but it wasn’t enough to stop him. Dinkheller, having been shot 9 times, was immobilized. That’s when Brannan, standing over the body of Dinkheller, took careful aim and shot him in the right eye while yelling “Die f-cker!” Brannan, now a murderer, ran to his truck and sped away. He was arrested the next morning. On January 28, 2000, Brannan was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. The jury concluded that he “murdered Dinkheller in a premeditated, torturous, and cruel manner.” Fifteen years later Brannan was executed. On January 13, 2015, he was given a lethal injection. While awaiting his execution Brannan was asked why he killed Deputy Dinkheller. His response? “Because he let me.” A few weeks prior to Dinkheller’s death, the young deputy had been reprimanded for being to “aggressive” during traffic stops. He was afraid of losing his job if he overreacted while on patrol. Many believe that was the reason he did not fire on Brannan when he reached inside of his truck. Truly tragic if that was the case. Here are the still photos of the scene. The first is the outline of Dinkheller’s body. His blood can been seen on the ground. The second photo is of Dinkheller’s cruiser, and the evidence markers denoting where bullet casing were found.   Every single person in America should see this video. Especially black Americans who believe they can disregard orders from police and not expect the most serious of consequences. Deputy Dinkheller gave his killer one too many chances. Police academies nationwide use this video as a training tool as to why officers cannot hesitate in situations such as this. Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby was just charged with first-degree manslaughter for shooting Terence Crutcher, a black man who ignored her orders not to return to his truck much like in this video. Officer Shelby most likely was shown this video during her training. She knew what the consequences could be if she hesitated. Watch the video of Deputy Dinkheller, and the hesitation that lead to his death. WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC VIDEO & AUDIO OF A MAN’S LAST MOMENTS ON EARTH  Color of skin is irrelevant. When cops are confronted, they just want to make sure they don’t end up like the deputy in this video… Dead. Don’t Stop Sharing This. Every American should see it. Especially those in the African-American community. The perp who killed Dinkheller was white, and he SHOULD have been shot the moment he reached into his truck. We’d expect the same if the perp was black. By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter ",0,0,1
1206,"Frustration is growing within Donald Trump’s campaign over the Republican nominee’s yawning money gap with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton -- just as the presidential race heads into its final fall stretch. Trump’s top advisers have held a series of tense conversations in recent days about how to close a fundraising hole that’s grown to over $200 million – a deficit that’s led Trump to essentially cede the TV airwaves to his Democratic rival. The discussions, which were relayed by more than a half-dozen sources, have veered into finger pointing, with some participants pinning the blame on the Republican National Committee or on Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s national finance chairman and a newcomer to the political scene. Story Continued Below The shortfall is putting Trump at a substantial disadvantage during the remaining few weeks of the campaign, as focus shifts to the clinical – and costly -- process of bringing voters out to the polls. “Between him dissing the donors in the primary and donors being more concerned about Congress, as they should be, it’s a significant gap for him to close,” said former GOP Rep. Vin Weber, a prominent Washington lobbyist and fundraiser. “I have to believe the Clinton campaign will know how to spend their money effectively during the last 45 days.” Last Thursday, Trump’s top brass, including Mnuchin, chief operating officer Eli Miller, Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner gathered in Trump Tower with Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Katie Walsh. At one point, Dallas investor Gentry Beach, a Trump fundraiser who has long been one of Donald Trump Jr.’s closest friends, launched into what four sources who were present described as a pointed critique of the RNC, which he said was coming up short. Gentry asked why he didn’t have access to the RNC’s donor data, two of the sources said -- implying that the committee was deliberately withholding critical information. To those assembled, the critique wasn’t entirely new – for weeks, tensions between Trump and the establishment-minded RNC have simmered over resources and the direction of the campaign. While some Trump aides argue that the committee has been less than helpful, many within the RNC are convinced the New York businessman is waging a lackluster campaign. But Kushner, a wealthy real estate executive and New York Observer publisher who has taken on an increasingly influential role in the campaign, pushed back forcefully – telling Beach in no uncertain terms that the Dallas investor didn’t know what he was talking about. Kushner, who is regularly in touch with Walsh and party chairman Reince Priebus, argued that the committee had been proven itself to be responsive. He reserved particular praise for Walsh. In an email, Beach disputed the characterization of the exchange but declined to go into specifics. An RNC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The tensions spilled over into a Monday conference call that stretched on for nearly an hour. Roy Bailey, a Dallas insurance executive and longtime GOP fundraiser who is close to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, urged the campaign to reach out to the large number of Republican donors who remain on the sidelines. At no point did Bailey explicitly attack Mnuchin, but three sources on the call said his critique was implicit – and clear: The campaign was failing to take the routine, obvious steps. Mnuchin pushed back. Yes, he’d be happy to contact still-uncommitted contributors. But the situation was complex. There were a number of major GOP donors who were aligned with the establishment and simply wouldn’t give to Trump, so why waste the effort? The discussion went on for a while longer, with Bailey arguing that new polls showing a tightening race could get some people to open their wallets. That’s when Woody Johnson jumped in. By that point, the call had gone on for nearly 45 minutes, and Johnson – the billionaire owner of the New York Jets – had had enough. Addressing Bailey directly, Johnson said that the best way to win over uncommitted donors was by contacting them, not sitting on conference calls. Then, the Jets owner abruptly hung up. Bailey did not respond to a request for comment, and a Johnson representative declined to discuss his role on the call. Reached on Friday, Mnuchin disputed the notion that disagreements had cropped up. “The campaign has an amazing relationship with the RNC,” he said. “We have been operating as one unified team for the past five months and achieved amazing success in all aspects of our fundraising.” The flare-up comes at a critical juncture in the campaign, as both sides turn their attention to voter turnout. Clinton has used her formidable financial advantage to significantly out-organize Trump, investing seven times the amount of money on TV ads and opening up dozens more swing-state field offices than her Republican opponent. Fundraising reports released this week painted a stark picture: While Clinton had raised $373 million to date, Trump had taken in $165 million. Particularly concerning for Trump were revelations this week that Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, one of the Republican Party’s biggest donors, had decided to direct just $5 million toward electing the GOP presidential nominee. Adelson, who’d once been expected to invest as much as $100 million in Trump, is instead focusing the vast majority of his political giving on down-ballot races. In the days since Monday’s call, and Johnson’s abrupt signoff, other members of Trump’s finance circle have been stewing over Bailey’s remarks. Many of them believe they’ve made the best out of a bad situation, pointing out that in the face of ongoing resistance from many of the party’s top donors and lacking the infrastructure of past GOP presidential nominees, they’ve managed to fund a national campaign. They also argue that the campaign has made serious strides in fundraising. Next week, it will hold two high-dollar events in New York City, one which will feature Ivanka Trump and the other that will be hosted by Trump and his vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence. And on Tuesday, the day after the first debate, Trump’s fundraisers will convene at Trump Tower to hold a “national call day” in hopes of winning over still-uncommitted donors. The campaign, tapping into Trump’s popularity among blue collar voters, has also developed a vaunted small-dollar operation that has raised around $100 million from contributors who’ve given $200 or less. Some of those helping Trump raise money were quick to defend Mnuchin, an ex-Goldman Sachs executive and former film producer who has far less political experience than his counterparts on previous presidential campaigns. They noted that Trump did not hold his first major fundraiser until late May, long after when nominees typically begin their pursuit of big-dollar donors. ""Given the totality of circumstances and the timing of the race, Steve has done a heroic job and he is one of the smartest people I have met on a campaign,” said Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street investor and Republican fundraiser who is helping to organize next week’s national call day. “Which is why he was probably smart enough to have never done this before.”",1,0,0
1165,"A New York judge has rejected a media request to make public the contents of a 25-year-old court file on Donald Trump's divorce from wife Ivana, saying the courts have no business deciding what information could be useful to voters. The New York Times and the Gannett newspaper chain filed a motion to unseal the records, arguing the move was needed to contribute to public debate over the real estate mogul and Republican nominee's fitness for the presidency. Story Continued Below Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Frank Nervo rejected that argument in a ruling released Thursday. ""Were the court to make the confidential records available for journalistic, and thus public, scrutiny, it would impermissibly inject itself into the political process by making the value judgment of what information is useful in determining the present candidate's, or any other candidate's, fitness for office,"" Nervo wrote. ""The court's role in the electoral process is strictly limited to determining whether a candidate complies with the Election Law. The court will not take an action that exceeds that limitation."" Earlier this month, lawyers for both Donald and Ivana Trump filed legal papers opposing the unsealing. The GOP presidential nominee argued that New York's legislature has put divorce files off-limits in most circumstances. His ex-wife agreed, but also contended that since she is not running for office, she should not have to sacrifice her privacy even if the court found an enhanced interest in her husband's actions. Her submission to the court noted published reports alleging that she claimed during the divorce that he had raped her. However, Ivana Trump's brief said that was not her view and dismissed those reports as ""previous misinterpreted statements and allegations.” The judge agreed with Ivana Trump that there was no reason to intrude on her privacy. ""The court is obviously aware that one of the parties, who opposes this motion, is a presidential candidate. The court is also aware that the other party, who also opposes this application, is not seeking public office,"" Nervo wrote. ""If the court were to deprive the candidate party of his rights...on the ground that there may be something in the confidential file that would be useful in determining his fitness for office, that ground does not exist in the case of his former wife, who is not a candidate."" A lawyer for the news outlets, David Schulz, said no immediate decision had been made about whether to appeal. ""We are pleased with the Court's well-reasoned decision and order,"" Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz said. Nervo's conclusion that judges shouldn't try to judge information's utility to voters is not universally shared on the bench. Several judges handling federal Freedom of Information Act lawsuits seeking information about Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state have cited the upcoming election as a reason to speed release of records held by the State Department.",1,0,0
1204,"Donald Trump’s team has created a detailed analysis of Hillary Clinton’s debate style — including her body language and verbal tics — with the goal of helping the GOP nominee exploit weaknesses during Monday’s debate, according to three sources familiar with Trump’s preparations. The “psychological profile,” as the analysis is being called, is based on a statistical analysis of videos from 16 years' worth of Clinton’s debates, dating back to her 2000 campaign for Senate in New York, according to the operatives. They said it was assembled with assistance from a political data firm called Cambridge Analytica that specializes in “psychographic” modeling of voters and donors, and that Trump’s top advisers have been pleased with the results. Story Continued Below The advisers believe that the profile proves that Clinton has significant weaknesses and that they have identified her ‘tells’ — words, phrases or gestures she uses when she’s unsure of an answer, or is trying to deflect her way out of an uncomfortable question, according to the operatives familiar with the preparations. For example, according to one of the sources, an operative who works with the campaign, Trump’s debate prep team believes that the profile proves that when ""she doesn't know the answer, she says this, etc.” The goal, said the operative, is to get Trump to recognize the tendencies, “so when he hears her say 'X' he knows what is going on, and can respond accordingly.” Another source, who has advised Trump’s aides on analytics, said that Trump’s debate team is using the profile to coach the candidate on the most fruitful moments and responses to aggressively challenge Clinton. “They think this psychological profile can predict how she’ll respond based on her body language and other stuff, and to tune Trump in to recognize and leverage that,” the analytics operative said, though he questioned the efficacy of the technique. “It’s really wacky pseudo-science.” Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about Trump’s debate preparations, the analysis or Cambridge Analytica’s role therein. And it’s unclear the degree to which Trump is heeding advice offered by his team based on the analysis, though The New York Times reported Friday that Trump has been watching video of Clinton’s “best and worst debate moments, looking for her vulnerabilities.” But the creation and use of the analysis at least partially calls into question the widespread perception that Trump’s debate preparations are unsophisticated and unstructured — especially compared to Clinton’s rigorous studying and moot-court-style mock debates. Clinton’s study materials reportedly also include assessments of Trump’s psychology, his varying moods and recommendations for throwing him off his game. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri suggested her campaign wasn’t much worried about the Trump team’s psychological analysis of Clinton. “Good luck,” she said Friday when she was asked about this story during a pre-debate media conference call. “We all have seen [Clinton] endure a lot of tough questioning over the years. We saw her endure 11 hours of tough questioning at the Benghazi hearing. And Donald Trump may think he’s the person who’s going to be able to really get under her skin, but I doubt it.” The Trump team’s psychological analysis of Clinton — and Cambridge Analytica’s involvement in it — also is testament to the growing clout in Trump’s orbit of the father-daughter duo of Bob and Bekah Mercer. The Mercer family, which has given $2 million to a pro-Trump super PAC that Bekah Mercer runs, largely owns Cambridge Analytica, and encouraged the Trump campaign to incorporate the company’s services into its operations. The company, which is the U.S. subsidiary of the British intelligence firm SCL Group, specializes in building “psychographic profiles” of voters. It has been retained by a number of campaigns and committees backed by the Mercers in recent years, including that of Trump’s rival in the GOP primary Ted Cruz. Cruz's campaign paid the firm $5.8 million for everything from polling to digital advertising to voter and donor modeling, according to Federal Election Commission filings, which show that the company was paid another $675,000 by a Mercer-funded super PAC supporting Cruz. Soon after Cruz dropped out of the race, however, the Mercers switched their support to Trump, and began encouraging the campaign to use Cambridge Analytica. FEC filings show that the Trump campaign in July and August paid the company $350,000 for data management. But campaign sources say the company is providing a broad array of services to the campaign, both out of the campaign’s roughly 60-person data, digital and technology operation in San Antonio and, to a lesser extent, in the campaign’s Manhattan headquarters. Additionally, sources familiar with the company said that its board includes Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon, whose addition to the campaign was encouraged by Bekah Mercer. Campaign sources say Bannon is participating in the debate preparation sessions, as is campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, another Mercer ally whose hiring Bekah Mercer encouraged. Bannon and Cambridge Analytica declined to comment for this story, while Conway and a Mercer family spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. But a Republican strategist who is close to the campaign said the Mercers are “attempting to bring order to the campaign and debate prep.”",1,0,0
1110,"Hillary Clinton will almost certainly win Monday night’s epic presidential debate on points — and still could lose. It’s hard to see how Clinton, who has marinated in public policy for 30 years and is preparing for the debate like it is the invasion of Normandy, won’t repeatedly best Donald Trump on substance. Story Continued Below Her strength in this area perfectly matches Trump’s weakness. Trump has appeared to learn for the first time such basic information as that the Trans-Pacific Partnership doesn’t include China and that Russia has already invaded Ukraine on the debate stage or during a media interview. He sometimes reads his speeches as if they include revelations to him — “so true,” he’ll interject after coming across a striking fact or observation in the text. If Trump has spent time hitting the briefing books, his campaign has kept it under wraps and he has yet to reveal any hint of a new policy depth in anything he’s said over the past few weeks. So Trump won’t be particularly well-informed, and figures it won’t particularly matter — and may well be right. Trump has a significant built-in advantage in that there is a lower standard for him — not because the media isn’t tough enough on him, as all the media mavens agree, but because he is the de facto challenger and candidate of change in a change election. Trump can win by clearing a bar of acceptability, whereas Clinton has to do more than that and either significantly wound Trump or make a compellingly positive case for herself that has so far eluded her in both 2008 and 2016. This is not to say that Trump won’t be on treacherous terrain. He can’t bully and mock Clinton the way he did his Republican rivals. He won’t have a crowd to feed off of. Without a teleprompter, message discipline still tends to elude him. The one-on-one format for an hour-and-a-half could make his thin knowledge painfully obvious. And any misstep or outburst that reinforces the idea that he lacks the qualities to be commander in chief would be devastating. But Trump just needs to seem plausible and the very fact that he is on a presidential debate stage, the most rarified forum in American politics, will benefit him. During the Republican primary debates, the intangibles worked in his favor and they presumably will on Monday, too. Trump is a big personality with a dominant physical presence. His critics often sneeringly say he is a reality TV star, but you don’t become one without charisma and a performative ability that are major political assets. The fact is that Trump will have to stumble badly — and probably sabotage himself — to live down to Hillary’s critique of him. She has made her campaign almost entirely about how Trump is a monstrous madman. This was an understandable calculation — she wanted to disqualify him out of the box and differentiate and isolate him from other Republicans. The cost is that she has done more than anyone to lower the standard for Trump. It’s not as though he needs to mount a convincing, detailed defense of his tax or child care plan or anything else to invalidate Clinton’s critique of him; he just needs to seem a reasonable person. That is why Trump doesn’t need to be the aggressor. As long as he’s firm and calm, he is implicitly rebutting the case against him on temperament. And then he can look for a big moment or two that will be memorable and drive the post-debate conversation in the media that is arguably as important as the debate itself. These contests aren’t evaluated by college-debate judges. Trump won one of the Republican primary debates with his barbed quip in response to Vicente Fox’s vulgar declaration that Mexico wouldn’t pay for the wall, “The wall just got 10 feet higher.” This wasn’t an argument or a policy; it was a sentiment. No one would have written it down in a briefing book. And yet, it punched through. If Trump has taught us anything, it is that simple, evocative statements can make up for a multitude of evasions and confused non-answers. In the past, most presidential debates have had a slight or ephemeral effect on the race. Monday could be different because it is an event tailor-made for Trump to change one of the main factors holding him back. By roughly 60 percent to 30 percent, people think Clinton is prepared to be president; by roughly 60 percent to 30 percent, people think Trump is not. A credible performance could move that number for Trump, and appreciably increase his odds of winning the presidency. Hillary is both formidably well-prepared for Monday, and at significant risk. Such is the dynamic of the race and the way most voters absorb information that she could “win” on points, and still lose ground.",1,0,0
