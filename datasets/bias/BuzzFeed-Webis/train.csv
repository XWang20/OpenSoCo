732,"HBO’s Real Time host Bill Maher – someone not often inclined to side with Donald Trump – said that Trump is right about profiling in the context of how to deal with terrorism. Here’s what he said: “He is for profiling, that’s what he said. But he said we should do it the way Israel does. And, like, every once in while Donald Trump says something right. Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apart… “What they do is they hire really smart people. This is not the TSA, which is just guys giggling at your balls when they’re looking — a screener. If we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in Israel. “And, again, we’re just talking about a few questions. We’re not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. I mean, I don’t think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.” He’s definitely right about the TSA. Their scanners and pat-down agents don’t do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that they’ll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through. It’s a wonder that we haven’t dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. How does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist? (Dumb question, I know…it’s government, so of course, it’s going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective.)

332,"Washington (CNN)Rep. John Lewis, a pioneer in the civil rights movement, wants the Obama administration to appoint observers for the November election in certain states. ""We should ask for federal protection,"" the Georgia Democrat said Wednesday, warning ""the election can be stolen on election day at polling places."" Lewis, who was badly injured in 1965 while marching in Selma, Alabama for voting rights for African-Americans, said several states including Georgia, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina should be monitored, and potentially all of the states that belonged to the confederacy. Lewis made his comments at a roundtable on voting rights with other Democrats and advocacy groups held in the room in the Capitol named after President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who signed the landmark voting right law. In August, the Supreme Court denied a request from North Carolina to allow provisions of its controversial voting rights law to go back into effect. The Supreme Court order meant provisions of the law -- concerning a tightening in voter ID requirements, cutbacks on early voting and the preregistration of 16-year-olds -- will remain off the books for November's election. The court's order was a major victory for challengers to the law, including civil rights groups and the Department of Justice, which argued that it had a disparate impact on minority voters. Lewis said the 2016 presidential election is the first since 1965 that voters don't have the full protections of the Voting Rights Act due to a Supreme Court ruling three years ago. The lawmaker said it was a ""shame and a disgrace"" that Congress hasn't acted on the issue. In 2013, the Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 decision that key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are no longer valid. The opinion left it to Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices. Chief Justice John Roberts explained the ruling saying ""our country has changed"" for the better. And that the conditions that moved Congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the United States to ""preclear"" changes to voting laws ""no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.""

959,"Hillary Clinton on Monday urged Americans not to get “diverted and distracted” by Donald Trump's inflammatory words as the United States combats the threat posed by the Islamic State. “Let’s not get diverted and distracted by the kind of campaign rhetoric we hear coming from the other side. This is a serious challenge,” Clinton told reporters after delivering a statement from White Plains, New York. “We are well equipped to meet it. And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.” Story Continued Below Clinton addressed the recent string of attacks in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota on Monday, remarking that the terrorist threat of the Islamic State is real while also casting herself as the only candidate with the experience necessary to handle such threats. “This threat is real but so is our resolve. Americans will not cower. We will prevail. We will defend our country and defeat the evil, twisted ideology of the terrorists,"" said Clinton, who implicitly contrasted her role as head of the State Department and Trump’s inexperience in politics and government as she declared, ""I’m the only candidate in this race who has been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield.” Clinton also presented herself as a longtime advocate of “tough vetting” and called for an improved visa system. Her response Monday contradicted Trump’s message. While the Republican presidential nominee seemingly encouraged racial profiling to help law enforcement stop future attacks during a phone interview with “Fox and Friends,” Clinton talked up her bona fides. “I was part of the national security team that worked with President Obama, developed strategies to fight the terrorists — sometimes that involved direct kinetic action, sometimes that involved working with allies and partners, sometimes that involved capture,” she said. “I won’t get into classified information, but I have sat at that table in the Situation Room, I have analyzed the threats, I have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. I know how to do this and I understand how we don’t want this to get even bigger than it already is.” As for Trump’s contributions to the terrorism conversation, Clinton cited his rhetoric as ammunition for the other side. “We know that Donald Trump’s comments have been used online for recruitment of terrorists,” she said. “We’ve heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists. We know from the former head of the Counterterrorism Center, Mike Olsen, that the language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries.” Trump on Monday again criticized President Barack Obama and Clinton for refusing to go after “radical Islamic terrorism.” But Clinton brushed off the real estate mogul’s criticism of her record. “Well, it’s like so much else he says: It’s not grounded in fact. It’s meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,” Clinton said. “And the facts are pretty clear that, you know, we still have challenges. That’s what I have been talking about throughout this campaign. I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work as I’ve done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS.” Clinton suggested Americans won’t hear her opponent’s plan, and not because it's secret. “He keeps saying he has a secret plan. Well, the secret is he has no plan,” she said. “So let’s focus on what we really can do, and what I've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.”",1,0,0
378,"(CNN)Sen. Jeff Sessions pilloried former President George H.W. Bush's decision to support Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump, saying the Bush family ""should remember the loyalty they were given by millions of Americans."" Sessions expressed frustration with Republicans who've refused to back Trump in an interview with the Washington Examiner published Wednesday. A long-serving Republican senator, he was among the first members of the so-called GOP ""establishment"" to throw his support behind the eventual nominee during the primary, and has been a fixture of the Trump campaign since. ""They should objectively analyze who is likely to advance best the agenda they favor and the agenda the Republicans who supported them favored. And that's clearly Donald Trump,"" Sessions said. The Alabama Republican also noted that ""millions of Americans, including this one, worked their hearts out for the Bushes in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004. And it wasn't Bill Clinton that helped the Bushes get elected. It was the same voters, in large part, that elected Ronald Reagan and stand to elect Donald Trump."" The elder Bush is the only member of the family whose support for Clinton has become public. Jeb Bush, whom Trump defeated during the primary, has said he won't support the nominee, and former President George W. Bush has declined to reveal his presidential preference. For Sessions, though, the choice is simple, and he expressed puzzlement about the Bush family. RELATED: Ivanka Trump huddles with female Republican members of Congress in Washington ""I think they're not thinking clearly enough about this,"" Sessions told the Washington Examiner. ""They're not ... appreciating half the American people, virtually, that have been supportive of Republicans. A lot of them preferred somebody other than Bush candidates, but they rallied around them when it came to November. So I would hope that we see more rallying."" And to other Republicans, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who have argued Trump isn't conservative enough to lead the party, Sessions says ""that's ridiculous."" ""At this point in history, it's the William F. Buckley test -- who is the most conservative candidate that can win the presidency? Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? On taxes, on regulations, on judges, on law enforcement — all these are conservative positions. What is the problem here?

680,"Over the weekend, Barack Obama addressed the Congressional Black Caucus for the last time as President. He hammered the Republican nominee and admonished black voters to vote for the Democratic nominee. He said he’d take it as a “personal insult” for members of the Black community not to vote for her. Here’s what he said: “If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn’t matter who we elect — read up on your history. It matters. We’ve got to get people to vote,” Obama said. “I will consider it a personal insult — an insult to my legacy — if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.” Well, there’s at least one member of the Black community who doesn’t care that it would be a personal insult to the president for him to vote not only against Hillary, but for Donald Trump. He goes by A.D. Bell, and according to his Twitter profile, he’s an “Army Vet, Realist Party Affil., Father, College Graduate, Man, Not a Liberal or a Conservative.” In his video, Bell asks the President what he’s going to do to him, since he’s voting for Trump. When people say they’re “insulted,” they act on it, he said. “So, what are you going to do to me, Mr. Obama?” an incensed Bell asked. “I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted me for a long time. I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted black people for a long time.” “You know what I’m doing?! I’m voting against them!” he yelled, pointing to his camouflage ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.

425,"(CNN)Aaron Sorkin could be earning royalties off the 2016 campaign. ""The West Wing"" creator's storylines are proving remarkably prescient in the epic Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton White House battle. A Democratic campaign grappling with a health crisis? Check. (See Hillary Clinton's pneumonia and Jed Bartlet's far more serious multiple sclerosis). Gaffes by politicians that conveniently help their cause? There, too, this year. A soon-to-be nominee iffy at best about his running mate? That happened on the NBC drama as well. The similarities are poised to cross into reality this weekend when most of the series' cast members will campaign for Hillary Clinton in Ohio. There's a certain irony to this, as many series plotlines about the White House of fictional commander in chief, Bartlet (Martin Sheen), were based on events from Bill Clinton's administration. ""The West Wing"" premiered with about 14 months left in Bill Clinton's presidency, and a swath of his former aides worked on the show as writers and producers. So in the already ""West Wing""-tinged 2016 campaign, what's next in made-for-television events? Five episodes offer clues. Unhealthy secrecy Bartlet is depicted in the series as an exemplar of virtue, both in public and private realms. A Nobel Prize-winning economist and former New Hampshire governor, he earnestly wrestles with public policy decisions based largely on his progressive principles. Bartlet is a devout Catholic and father of three daughters seemingly without hint of personal scandal. But he's not infallible. It's revealed midway in the first season that Bartlet has been hiding a years-ago diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. And he had full complicity from his physician wife Abby (Stockard Channing), who delivered shots of a mitigating drug, betaseron. The secret is so closely-held that the Bartlets initially keep it from the candidate/president's close friend, Leo McGarry (John Spencer) -- who convinced Bartlet to seek the White House in the first place. McGarry is eventually let in on it after the president collapses in the Oval Office. But the trio keeps White House senior staff members in the dark for more than a year. A miniature version of this drama recently played out in the 2016 campaign, although over a considerably less serious medical issue for Clinton. Compared to Bartlet's years-long conspiracy of silence over a potentially life-threatening condition, for only two days she neglected to inform the public about a common health concern, pneumonia, from which she quickly recovered, according to medical information provided by her campaign. Clinton in September was slow to reveal the pneumonia diagnosis, after a spate of coughing fits during a speech and on her campaign plane. And she doesn't appear to have informed many of her top aides about it. Her doctor revealed the candidate's pneumonia diagnosis on the afternoon of Sunday, September 11, through her campaign. But that was two days late, and only after the Democratic nominee stumbled and exited a 9/11 commemoration ceremony early -- in full public view. Many people even inside the Clinton campaign did not know about the pneumonia diagnosis. An aide said that Clinton ""thought she could push through this ... she was feeling better"" -- until that Sunday morning. In both cases, neither politician actually presented false information to the public. ""Nobody lied,"" an exasperated McGarry says tells White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), during one one particularly dramatic ""West Wing"" scene. Political 'gaffes'? Riffing at a campaign fundraiser in New York on September 8, Hillary Clinton veered into seemingly dangerous political territory. ""To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Clinton said. ""Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it."" Clinton then said some of these people were ""irredeemable"" and ""not America."" Predictable outrage soon followed from the Trump campaign and supporters. Clinton -- kind of -- walked it back. ""I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong,"" she said in a statement in which she also vowed to call out ""bigotry"" in Trump's campaign. The episode seemed like the self-inflicted wound of Clinton's political career. She insulted a broad swath of the electorate, and gave her opponents an opening to play victim of mean-spirited attacks. But her ""deplorables"" jab at Trump voters had another effect -- it put Trump and allies on the defense to show its campaign supporters weren't racist. In doing so, it stirred a lively -- and ongoing -- conversation about some of the more controversial elements of the Trump coalition. In other words, Clinton set the terms of argument -- and potentially helped rally her Democratic base. The incident called to mind a similar Bartlet ""gaffe"" made in the course of a heated presidential race, which ended up helping his cause. In a 2002 episode, Bartlet is caught on camera ""accidentally"" questioning the intelligence of his GOP opponent, Florida Gov. Rob Ritchie. After touting his administration's energy plan, he disparages his rival -- a thinly-veiled George W. Bush stand-in -- as a "".22 caliber mind in a .357 Magnum world."" For days, the Bartlet White House is on the defensive for an unsportsmanlike insult at a campaign rival. But it turns out Bartlet's blunder was anything but. The errant comment triggers waves of coverage about his rival's smarts -- or lack thereof -- while raising awareness about the energy proposal. ""It didn't turn out too bad at all,"" White House Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) muses to Bartlet in the episode's closing scene. ""In fact, the whole country's talking about whether Ritchie's smart enough to be president. And you didn't take a hit, because it was an accident."" Party crashers When Trump entered the 2016 GOP primary race, he faced a wall of establishment-type pols -- Marco Rubio, John Kasich and many more. He beat them all. Jed Bartlet, too, was an outsider candidate who shocked the political establishment. He started out far behind Texas Sen. John Hoynes (Tim Matheson), but his populist message eventually overtook his Democratic rivals. Bartlet at times shows existential angst over his place in the party firmament. Notably in the Season 2 finale ""Two Cathedrals,"" he ponders whether to run for re-election after a primetime news conference revealing his MS condition, and juggling several crises, foreign and domestic. In a dream sequence with his recently-deceased secretary, a big-sister-like figure for decades, Bartlet observes, ""I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham: I've never been the most popular guy in the Democratic Party."" Trump, though, has shown no such self-reflection. He routinely boasts of beating out 16 GOP primary rivals. As Ms. Landingham predicted would happen for Bartlet and the Democrats, the Republican National Committee and party apparatus have rallied around Trump. You can't always get what you want A recurring ""West Wing"" subplot depicts long-simmering tension between Bartlet and his vice president, the past primary rival. A more conservative Democrat, Hoynes was a one-time favorite for the party nod who ultimately lost to the upstart Granite State challenger. Bartlet put Hoynes on the ticket out of necessity to win Southern states -- a New England-Texas alliance reminiscent of John F. Kennedy tapping Lyndon Johnson as his running mate in 1960. Both odd-couple tickets led to transactional relationships at best. LBJ was famously cut out of Kennedy's inner circle. ""West Wing's"" Hoynes is seen repeating trying to undercut the president. In fact, it's a Hoynes New Hampshire trip that forces Bartlet's hand into revealing the president's MS condition. In 2016, Republican nominee Trump isn't on such fraught terms with his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Outwardly, they seem cordial enough, with Pence playing the good solider, dutifully defending Trump's many controversial remarks. But it's no love affair, either. In searching for an understudy, Trump over the summer reportedly narrowed his search to three finalists -- Pence, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Trump finally went with Pence. But he was so unenthusiastic about it that the night before the campaign's scheduled announcement he frantically called advisers and friends about how to reverse the decision. By that time, Pence was already ensconced in a New York hotel room, with the full expectation that he would be announced as Trump's choice. It was simply too late for a change. But a less-than-subtle signal about Trump's feelings came the next day when he spent a full 30 minutes talking before letting his running mate have a few words at the microphone. The Trump campaign rally theme song that then blared -- ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" by The Rolling Stones -- seemed particularly apt for the moment. The lawsuit election Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state has led to a series of ongoing headaches in her 2016 campaign. While let off the hook by the FBI about whether she improperly dealt with classified material on an unprotected network, conservative critics are still on her case. And one group, Judicial Watch, has drawn a measure of political blood. The group filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department in 2015, and in August, it released 296 pages of emails from the Democratic presidential nominee -- including 44 that Judicial Watch says were not previously handed over to the State Department by Clinton. The emails, many of which are heavily redacted, raise questions about the Clinton Foundation's influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure. In one instance, top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band lobbied Clinton aides for a job for someone else in the State Department. In the email, Band tells Hillary Clinton's former aides at the department -- Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin -- that it is ""important to take care of (redacted)."" Band is reassured by Abedin that ""Personnel has been sending him options."" The revelations haven't derailed Clinton's campaign -- but they weren't helpful, either. And the documents recall an early ""West Wing"" story arc including a conservative legal group, ""Freedom Watch,"" which forces Bartlet administration senior staff members to testify in depositions about alleged White House drug use. The group's target is McGarry, a recovering drug addict and alcoholic. Freedom Watch obtains supposedly-private records from McGarry's treatment center. It forces McGarry, a former Labor secretary, into an embarrassing public admission. Even during ""West Wing's"" original run, Freedom Watch looked familiar. The fictionalized conservative watchdog group was, not surprisingly, based on Judicial Watch. The real life group has a long history with the Clintons, having filed lawsuits over 1990s-era controversies like the Vince Foster suicide. ",1,0,0
1485,"It’s not game over yet Hillary! Congress is out to find the truth and in a letter on Sept 9, asked for Comey to release all information he had regarding Hillary’s email scandal that FBI went over as evidence. He did not comply. So now…Congress has subpoenaed him! The Washington Examiner reported: House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, subpoenaed FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server Hillary Clinton used when she led the State Department. Smith asked Comey for the documents in a Sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after Comey failed to comply with the request. “The committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former Secretary Clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by FISMA,” the statement from the committee read. Rep. Smith earlier requested more information about Hillary Clinton’s server activities, such as the interviews with the Platte River employees involved in setting up and maintaining the private server. Recently, Platte River Networks employee Paul Combetta, who reportedly used BleachBit to “wipe” Hillary’s server, plead the Fifth before Congress. The obfuscation from the U.S. government over the private email server of Hillary Clinton, whose communication practices while at the State Department undoubtedly put the nation’s security at risk, is an alarming thing. The executive branch is ideally meant to be aloof from election matters; but as we have seen with the IRS, EPA and other government agencies stocked with card-carrying Democrats, “everything is politics.” Does this mean that a Clinton indictment is still a possibility so close to election? Anything could happen. The ramifications of an indictment so close to election day would be huge for their party- with quite a blow back. They should have just told the truth a lot earlier…to save themselves the embarrassment, and the trouble. The irony of it being, many Democrats would have gladly traded in Hillary for Bernie or Biden. Only time will tell what’s going to happen. Here’s hoping that Hillary’s skeletons will bury her career all on their own. me Sep 21, 2016 at 1:25 pm HAHAHAHA, We can only pray that something good WILL come out of this for America’s SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Trump 2016!!!!!!",0,0,1
1091,"The Senate on Wednesday backed a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, even as Congress is preparing to override an expected presidential veto of a different bill allowing 9/11 victims’ families to sue the Saudi government. The Senate voted 71-27 to table, or kill, the resolution from Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that would have blocked the $1.15 billion sale of Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia, which the State Department approved last month. Story Continued Below While the vote was unsuccessful, Murphy said his goal wasn’t necessarily to pass the resolution, but rather to press Saudi Arabia on its role in the civil war in Yemen. Riyadh has been accused of killing civilians with airstrikes in Yemen and other human rights violations. “I don’t think the Saudis are interested in continually having a debate about the future of U.S.-Saudi relationship on the floor of the Senate or the House,” Murphy told POLITICO ahead of the vote. “I knew from the beginning that this was not becoming law. My point here is to raise a discussion about the war in Yemen and Saudi behavior in the region that isn’t happening.” Opponents of the resolution — including Republican Senate foreign policy stalwarts like Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — argued that the Saudis were important allies in the Middle East, despite their abuses in the war in Yemen. “Were this resolution disapproval ever to be adopted, it would further convince the world that the United States is retreating not only from its commitments, but also as the guarantor of the international order,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor Wednesday. The arms sale vote comes at a tense time in U.S.-Saudi relations, as Congress is preparing to override a presumed veto on legislation that also targets Saudi Arabia. The White House plans to issue a formal veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to sue foreign governments found responsible for them. The legislation, which breezed unanimously through both chambers of the Capitol earlier this year, has long been viewed as focusing on Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in the terrorist attacks. The so-called “28 pages,” part of a 2002 probe that was declassified in July, included some indications that appear to suggest links between a handful of Saudis in the United States and two of the 9/11 hijackers. Some influential lawmakers have shown hesitation about the 9/11 bill and its implications as an override vote became imminent. President Barack Obama has not vetoed the legislation yet; he has until Friday to do so, and McConnell said the vote will be held before senators leave Washington until the November elections. Murphy said it was “unfortunate” the timing of the two bills intersected, arguing they were two separate issues that both happened to deal with Saudi Arabia. “I think there are a lot of people who want to vote — who will vote to override the JASTA veto and then vote against our resolution as a means of balancing their votes out,” he said. “Had our resolution happened at a different time, the vote might be different.” Opponents of the disapproval resolution also made a distinction between supporting the 9/11 bill and supporting the arms sale to the Saudis. Republicans who came to the floor to back the sale tied it to Iran, charging that Iran was on the other side of the civil war in Yemen and that Saudi Arabia was essential as a counterbalance in the region. “You're talking about a body and an idea that is ass-backwards, this is one for the ages,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “To those who want to vote today to suspend this aid to Saudi Arabia, people in Iran will cheer you on.” The U.S. has played a support role for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war, providing aerial refueling and intelligence sharing. The proposed arms sale to the Saudis includes 153 Abrams tanks, and 20 “battle damage replacements,” likely from their use in the Yemen war. Wednesday vote wasn’t the first time that Paul and Murphy have teamed up to force a vote on a sale to a Middle Eastern ally with a checkered history. In March, the pair forced a vote on the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, which was also blocked by the Senate, 71 to 24. Paul’s Senate campaign sent out a note to his supporters ahead of the vote Wednesday, urging them to “#standwithrand” and to sign a petition backing his resolution.",1,0,0
492,"What emerged, though, was in format and outward appearance similar to debates past -- two people behind lecterns -- only this time featuring what appeared to be a seasoned politician and a political novice. And it was Trump, expected to earn points for style, who at times seemed rattled, one of several distractions related less to the content of what he said than the manner in which he delivered it. The give and take didn't make for a sterling night, necessarily, as political theater. But for those who concluded that hosting ""The Apprentice"" would ready Trump for this sort of exercise, well, it turns out those are very different muscles than the ones he had to put to use on Monday night. Clinton, clearly, came into the debate with a strategy that she prosecuted almost without deviation: The goal was to appear unflappable, relaxed and almost dismissive of Trump's statements, while working in a few well-practiced zingers. That included pointing out that she had prepared for the debate, which offered a stark alternative to some of Trump's riffing, disjointed answers. There were also some effective ad-libs, such as when she reacted to a rambling Trump response by saying, ""Just listen to what you heard."" Related: One thing Clinton and Trump didn't debate: the debate itself Trump, by contrast, having faced multiple rivals during the primaries, looked uncomfortable in this one-on-one format. With so many people on stage during the primaries, his attacking style could stand out; here, having to share the spotlight only with Clinton, it was harder to employ that hit-and-run tactic. He interrupted Clinton repeatedly -- at first to get in points, but as the debate progressed those interruptions increasingly felt like fits of pique, as if all the attack ads she's running against him (which he referenced) had gotten under his skin. Trump's sniffling, which persisted throughout, also provided a distraction -- not a big deal, in theory, but the kind of thing teed up to be ridiculed in real time on social media. Trump's attempts to steamroll through certain exchanges created some problems for the third person in this mini-drama, Lester Holt. Holt, the ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor, had perhaps the most unenviable task one could imagine, given all the hand-wringing that preceded it and the Tuesday-morning quarterbacking that's sure to follow. Holt acquitted himself well enough, occasionally fact-checking Trump's statements -- usually when he sought to deny direct quotes that had been attributed to him -- and pressing him for specific answers. Those few moments when he challenged the candidate likely won't sit well with Trump's most ardent supporters, but Holt at least avoided the notion that the moderator should be some sort of potted plant who asks questions and completely gets out of the way. To that extent, his performance offered a measure of redemption for NBC News. Trump's impulse to look for one-liners also let him down when Clinton hammered him for not releasing his tax returns. When Clinton suggested that he might be hiding the fact that he hadn't paid any federal taxes, he interjected, ""That makes me smart,"" a quip that was both ill considered and potentially problematic for him in the days ahead. Related: NBC looks to Lester Holt for debate win after 2016 mishaps Indeed, if Trump is the more practiced performer, it didn't show. Clinton maintained an appearance of calm while Trump spoke, occasionally smiling but looking intent and engaged. Trump adopted a steely-eyed squint in the early portion of the debate -- somewhere between Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris -- but seemed less energetic as the evening wore on. Prior to the debate, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow noted that presidential debates are ""the most unpredictable, the least scripted"" of all major political events. As TV insiders know, reality television really isn't unscripted, and those programs benefit from the input of producers and editors in shaping storylines and the way characters are presented. In this first debate, anyway, Clinton stuck to her script, and Trump generally looked like he could have used a more detailed one.",1,0,0
1179,"The reliably liberal editorial board of the Los Angeles Times has endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her ""an experienced, thoughtful and deeply knowledgeable public servant"" in a lengthy editorial. The paper lambasted Donald Trump, by contrast, as a ""thin-skinned demagogue who is unqualified and unsuited to be president."" Story Continued Below Echoing criticisms leveled by Clinton and her allies, the editorial attacks the billionaire businessman as someone who ""has never held elected office and has shown himself temperamentally unfit to do so. ""He has run a divisive, belligerent, dishonest campaign, repeatedly aligning himself with racists, strongmen and thugs while maligning or dismissing large segments of the American public. Electing Trump could be catastrophic for the nation,"" the board writes. The editorial then goes on detail Clinton's perceived strengths and attack Trump's record at length. But it also wrestles with the former secretary of state's perceived shortcomings, noting her ""penchant for secrecy"" and dinging her ""for adjusting her positions to match popular opinion and for being a little too comfortable with the use of military force."" Ultimately, the board concludes: ""To be a great president, she will have to struggle to overcome her own weaknesses. But compared with Trump’s infirmities as a candidate, her failings are insignificant.

375,"(CNN)A six-year-old boy from New York has won the respect of US President Barack Obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in Omran Daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in Aleppo, Syria, was bombed. The image of five-year-old Omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old Alex, from Scarsdale, New York, to take action. In a handwritten letter sent to the White House, Alex asked Obama to go and collect Omran and bring him to his house where ""we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons."" Alex said that Omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him. Obama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook. In his message, Obama asked people to read the letter to ""understand why he had decided to share it with the world."" ""Those are the words of a six-year-old boy -- a young child who has not learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray,"" the President wrote. ""We should all be more like Alex. Imagine what the world would look like if we were,"" he added. READ MORE: Omran, a vivid reminder of war's horror At the time of writing the post has collected more than 100,000 ""likes"" and been shared more than 60,000 times, with many Facebook users praising the compassion shown by Alex. One Facebook user wrote: ""A six-year-old who has more humanity, love, and understanding than most adults. Kudos to his parents and I know the world will see more great things coming from Alex."" Another added: ""I heard this earlier today, as read by my president. Even with that pre-conditioning, made me cry while reading it just now. Neither of these sweet little boys, someone's sons, are Skittles."" Donald Trump Jr., the son of the Republican presidential nominee, sparked controversy Monday when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles candies. ",1,0,0
1134,"Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 1 point among Florida’s likely voters, a new Suffolk University poll released Thursday shows, placing the candidates in a statistical dead heat. On the Sunshine State’s crowded presidential ballot, the Republican nominee leads the former secretary of state by a narrow 45 percent to 44 percent margin. Of the four other candidates named on the ballot, only Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein registered any support, with 3 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively. Because the poll’s margin of error is plus-or-minus 4.4 percentage points, Trump’s 1 point lead puts him in a statistical tie with Clinton in Florida. Still, it is more good news for the Manhattan billionaire who has also polled ahead in recent days in the key swing states of Nevada, Ohio and North Carolina. President Barack Obama won those three states as well as Florida in his 2008 presidential bid and lost only North Carolina from that group in 2012. In the Florida senate race, incumbent GOP Sen. Marco Rubio leads Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy by 9 points, 43 percent to 34 percent. Rubio, a former Republican presidential candidate, had initially said he would not run for reelection to the Senate if he failed to earn the nomination but wound up entering and winning Florida’s GOP Senate primary. Murphy defeated firebrand liberal Rep. Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary to earn his spot on the general election ballot. The Suffolk University poll was conducted from Sept. 19-21 among 500 likely Florida voters. The poll’s margin of error was plus-or-minus 4.4 points.",1,0,0

778,"A well known Black Lives Matter activist called police for help when he was the victim of an armed robbery. Ironically, he is now called for a larger police presence in the form of intervention and protection in his neighborhood. The man is Jerry Ford Jr. whose a new graduate of the University of Houston. He has spent most of his time speaking out against police brutality. But he certainly wasn’t when he called for help.    A firearm ready criminal robbed him right outside of his apartment complex where he lives just a few blocks away from his college campus. Now he’s calling on the police and the university as well as other local authorities to increase the level of police in the area. Specifically, the area between the campus and the living complex. Many students from the school live there. Ford said he thought the robber was originally a student. Ford stated the man asked if he had a key and he responded that he did and then proceeded to open the door. When he turned around he was staring down the barrel of the gun the criminal was holding. He told the media, “I reach in right here to open the door, and I turn back around and he has the gun right there in my face.” The criminal is also a thief because he stole Ford’s cell phone and wallet. He demands now that police patrol the area since local and university police do not. The greatest part is that he claims he is not anti-police he is just anti-bad police. That’s a really good cop out when you need the help of the people you’ve been bashing for years. Ford also insists he isn’t just doing this for himself but also for the safety of everyone in his complex including other students. “It’s becoming a pattern. I hope they would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” You’ve got to love the liberal logic behind that. ",0,0,1
1060,"Election Day is more than a month away, but voters are already casting ballots to pick their next president. Voting opened on Monday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, making the town's voters among the first in the nation to do so. So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots. And other states are joining soon: New Jersey starts early voting on Saturday, and Vermont plans to start early voting as soon as the ballots are ready. (State rules say no later than Saturday.) Story Continued Below In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case. Typically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said. Here’s when early voting begins in each state. (Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.) Alabama — There’s no universal early voting in Alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Alaska — Oct. 24. Arizona — Oct. 12. Local counties are still finalizing the locations where voters can vote in-person, but ballots for mail-in voting begin going out on the 12th. Arkansas — Oct. 24. California — Early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality. Oct. 10 is the first day to vote early in Los Angeles County. Colorado — Oct. 24. Connecticut — There is no early voting in Connecticut, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. District of Columbia — Oct. 22 at One Judiciary Square, Oct. 29 for all other locations. Delaware — There is no early voting in Delaware, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Florida — All counties are required to allow voting from Oct. 29 to Nov. 5. Some have the option to start earlier. Georgia — Oct. 17. Voters can sign up for an absentee ballot starting Sept. 20. Hawaii — Oct. 25. Idaho — Sept. 23. Counties must send out absentee ballot requests no later than the 23rd, but are allowed to offer early voting. Early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality. Illinois — Sept. 29 to Nov. 7. Starting Sept. 29, voters can only cast their ballots at their local election authority or a temporary location, but early voting expands to permanent polling places starting Oct. 24. Indiana — Oct. 12. Early voting starts at the local county election board office or another designated location, but with an excuse, voters can cast a ballot by mail. Iowa — Sept. 29. Kansas — Oct. 19. Counties are allowed to set earlier extended early voting dates. Kentucky — There is no early voting in Kentucky, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Louisiana — Oct. 25 to Nov. 1. Maine — Oct. 9 is the general opening date, but the state allows you to vote as soon as the ballots are printed, and some people have already cast their ballots. Maryland — Oct. 27 to Nov. 3. Massachusetts — Oct. 24 to Nov. 4. Michigan — There is no early voting in Michigan, as voters require a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Minnesota — Sept. 23. Mississippi — There is no early voting in Mississippi, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Missouri — There is no early voting in Missouri, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Montana — In-person early voting begins as soon as ballots are ready, which is expected to be around Oct. 11. Nebraska — Oct. 3. The counties mail out requests starting on the 3rd, but the first day to vote early in-person is Oct. 7. Nevada — Oct. 22. New Hampshire — There is no early voting in New Hampshire, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. New Jersey — Sept. 24. In-person early voting may begin sooner (it starts as soon as ballots are available), but mail-in ballots are sent out beginning on the 24th. New Mexico — Oct. 11 to Nov. 5. Voters can apply for an absentee ballot on Oct. 11, but starting on the 22nd they can vote early in person. New York — There is no early voting in New York, as voters require a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. North Carolina — Sept. 9, Oct. 20 to Nov. 5. Absentee ballots have already been sent out, but the formal early voting period does not start until October. North Dakota — Sept. 29. Absentee and mail ballots can be sent out by county officials starting on the 29th, but the exact date might vary from one location to the next. Ohio — Oct. 12. Oklahoma — Nov. 3 to Nov. 5. Oregon — Oct. 19. Pennsylvania — There is no early voting in Pennsylvania, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Rhode Island — There is no early voting in Rhode Island, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. South Carolina — There is no early voting in South Carolina, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. The state does, however, give voters more absentee leeway than many. South Dakota — Sept. 23. Tennessee — Oct. 19 to Nov. 3. Texas — Oct. 24 to Nov. 4. Utah — Oct. 25 to Nov. 4. Virginia — There is no early voting in Virginia, unless voters have a state-approved excuse to vote absentee. Vermont — Sept. 23 to Nov. 7. Early voting could start before the 23rd, but it will not begin any later than that date. Washington — Oct. 21. Some voters may receive their ballot earlier, but this is the latest counties can mail them out. West Virginia — Oct. 26 to Nov. 5. Wisconsin — Early voting opening dates are set by the county/municipality. Wisconsin Rapids began voting Sept. 19. Wyoming — Sept. 23 to Nov. 7.",1,0,0
13,"A federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday that a witness will testify that Republican Gov. Chris Christie was told about a plan to close traffic lanes near the George Washington Bridge as part of a political vendetta while the shutdown was happening, a claim Christie has contested for years. The trial comes three years after gridlock paralyzed a town next to the busy bridge, which connects New Jersey and New York City, for four days. Prosecutors said two former Christie allies, Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly, had sought political revenge against Democratic Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, who didn't endorse Christie for re-election. Baroni was a top Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs area bridges, tunnels and transit hubs. Kelly was Christie's former deputy chief of staff. Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna told jurors that another Port Authority official, David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty in connection with the scandal last year, will testify he and Baroni made Christie aware of the plan during a Sept. 11 memorial in New York in 2013, three days after the gridlock started. ""The evidence will show that ... they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned,"" Khanna said. Christie has denied knowing about the scheme until well after it was carried out, and a taxpayer-funded report he commissioned absolved him of wrongdoing. He wasn't charged in the federal investigation. A message left at his office seeking comment wasn't immediately returned Monday. Christie, an unsuccessful candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, conceded last week that the bridge scandal was a factor in GOP nominee Donald Trump's not picking him as a running mate. Defense attorneys spent considerable time in their opening statements castigating Wildstein, a former political blogger and high school classmate of Christie who they called the governor's hatchet man at the Port Authority. They characterized him as a vulgar, power-smitten opportunist aiming to ride Christie's coattails to Washington, D.C., at a time when Christie, about to easily win re-election in his heavily Democratic state, was seen as a top presidential hopeful. Kelly's attorney, Michael Critchley, called Wildstein and others in Christie's inner circle ""cowards who were addicted to power"" and said Kelly, who had been deputy chief of staff for three months at the time of the lane closures, was a sacrificial lamb. ""The idea that Bridget Kelly is directing the affairs of the state of New Jersey is almost laughable,"" he said. ""They wanted to throw her, in some sense, under the presidential bus."" Baroni's lawyer, Michael Baldassare, called Wildstein a liar and ""a horrible person, a vindictive individual who would destroy your life."" In the government's opening, Khanna described how crushing gridlock engulfed Fort Lee on four days beginning Sept. 9, 2013, and how the defendants ignored Sokolich's texts, emails and voicemails seeking help. Kelly's ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee"" email to Wildstein was sent Aug. 13, 2013, a day after she was notified Sokolich wouldn't endorse Christie, Khanna said. He added that although the lane realignment was Wildstein's idea, Wildstein ""will also tell you Kelly instructed him to take that action and Baroni blessed it. And the three of them worked hand in hand."" Critchley, Kelly's attorney, said Kelly regretted sending the email but it was merely joking banter taken out of context. He told jurors Kelly believed Wildstein's proffer that the three access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge were part of a ""corrupt political deal"" years ago and should be re-examined. Baroni and Kelly face counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, deprivation of civil rights and misusing an organization receiving federal funds, the Port Authority. The most serious charge in the indictment, wire fraud conspiracy, carries a maximum 20-year prison term upon conviction. Witness testimony is scheduled to begin Tuesday, with Fort Lee's police chief. ——— This story has been corrected to show that Kelly was former deputy chief of staff, not chief of staff.",1,0,0
327,"New York (CNN)President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office. Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency. ""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us."" That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January. Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail. Obama took a step toward solidifying the alliance this month by completing a long-term, $38 billion security aid package for Israel, the largest such agreement ever for a US ally. The aid, Obama said, ""allows the kind of certainty in a moment where there's enormous uncertainty in the region. It is a very difficult and dangerous time in the Middle East and we want to make sure Israel has full capabilities to keep the Israeli people safe."" In their talks, Obama said he and his Israeli counterpart would discuss challenges in Syria, and said he would get Netanyahu's assessment of conditions in Israel and the West Bank. ""Clearly there is great danger of not just terrorism but also flare-ups of violence,"" he said. ""We do have concerns about settlement activity as well."" Obama hopes to take steps in his final days in office to promote renewed talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians on peace, though his previous efforts toward reconciliation in the region have fallen short. ""My hope is we can continue to be an effective partner in Israel in finding a path to peace,"" Obama said. But the White House remains opposed to Israel's expanded settlement activity in the West Bank, and has expressed disappointment at Netanyahu's occasional skepticism about the viability of a two-state solution in the region. In the meeting Wednesday Obama raised ""profound US concerns about the corrosive effect that that is having on the prospects of two states."" ""They've never papered over their differences,"" another senior administration official said of Obama and Netanyahu. In his final United Nations address Tuesday, Obama made scant reference to the Israel-Palestine conflict, saying only that ""Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land."" The passing remark was in stark comparison to the large amounts of time Obama spent on the issue during addresses to the UN earlier in his tenure. The shift reflected the now-frozen peace negotiations, which moved in spurts during Obama's presidency but never materialized into a workable solution. The White House has conceded that talks aren't likely to resume while Obama remains in office but has remained open to the possibility the President could take steps in the next months to ramp up pressure on both sides to work toward a two-state solution. ""With respect to Middle East peace, I wouldn't rule out the President taking any particular step on the issue,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Tuesday. ""What I would say is his test has always been, can I make a positive difference by engaging on the Israeli-Palestinian issue? We've tried multiple tactics, none of them have succeeded, given the fact that the parties themselves have been unable to come together."" Obama's talks with Netanyahu Wednesday capped a tumultuous personal history, though both displayed a businesslike camaraderie during their photo-op. The low point between the two men came in March 2015, when Netanyahu infuriated the White House by publicly lobbying against the Iran nuclear deal before Congress -- a move the administration lambasted as a breach of diplomatic protocol. Netanyahu returned to Washington last November in an attempt to repair the relationship, meeting with Obama in the Oval Office and addressing both the conservative American Enterprise Institute and the left-leaning Center for American Progress, the think tank with ties to Clinton. Netanyahu on Wednesday invited Obama for a round of golf in Israel once he departs office in January, saying warmly that Obama's ""influential voice"" on international politics would remain a force ""for many decades."" ""Our alliance has grown decade after decade, through successive presidents, bipartisan Congresses and with the overwhelming support of the American people,"" he said. ""It is an unbreakable bond.""

1414,"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were one of Hollywood’s most high-profile couples. But apparently, that is all over now: Angelina Jolie has just filed for divorce. Jolie, 41, cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for splitting from her husband of just two years. Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, but their relationship controversially began while Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston, in 2004 while they were filming the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Pitt and Aniston divorced in January of 2005 and just months later, Pitt and Jolie went public with their relationship with her adopted son Maddox. Jolie adopted another child, a girl from Ethiopia, and then announced that she was pregnant with Pitt’s child. The couple adopted another child in 2007 before giving birth to twins in 2008.   While Pitt and Jolie had been together since 2004, they didn’t get engaged until 2012. The pair reportedly were waiting to get married until LGBT couples could also get married. Reports say that Jolie was angry with Pitt’s parenting style. She allegedly felt that Pitt was not safe around their kids, was unhappy with his alleged marijuana use, and thought he has anger issues. It has also been reported that Jolie hired a private detective to spy on him while he was filming his latest movie in London, because she suspected that he was cheating on her. Those suspicions were allegedly confirmed by the detective. Jolie is also known for her humanitarian work and is a United Nations special envoy, recently appearing before the UN to speak on behalf of Syrian refugees. Pitt, meanwhile, was reportedly much more interested in being part of Hollywood, making movies and going to parties.   It has been reported that Jolie is requesting sole custody of the couple’s six children and is seeking to have Pitt be given visitation rights only. Attorney Laura Wasser is said to be representing Jolie in the divorce, who also represented actress Amber Heard in her divorce from Johnny Depp earlier this year. ",0,0,1
1184,"Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose conviction on corruption charges was overturned by the Supreme Court last June, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday that “I’ve got my PhD in suffering.” “You learn more in life through suffering than you do success, and I’ve learned a lot,” the former Virginia governor told host Mika Brzezinski. Story Continued Below McDonnell, once considered a candidate to join the 2012 Republican presidential ticket as Mitt Romney’s running mate, was convicted in 2014 on 11 corruption-related felony counts stemming from the over $175,000 in gifts and loans the former governor and his wife accepted from Virginia businessman Johnnie Williams. Those gifts included vacations, designer clothing and a Rolex watch. But McDonnell contended that those gifts and loans had never prompted him to provide any special treatment for Williams. On Friday, McDonnell said “there was never any quo” in the quid pro quo case that the prosecution built against him. The governor’s conviction was overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court last June. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the court’s opinion in the decision, said prosecutors had relied on a “boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute” and added that “setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an ‘official act.’” McDonnell admitted that the case had been difficult on his family but also noted that four of his grandchildren were born during the legal process surrounding his case. Two of them, he said, were born shortly after court hearings and all of their births “were a sign to me there is a bright future on the other side of this and things are going to be okay.” He said that even though he complied with Virginia’s laws, he regretted taking “my eye off the ball” in monitoring what gifts his family members had received. He also admitted that accepting a business loan from Williams was “a big red flag” and “probably not good judgment on my part.” “I'm glad to be vacated, but I have done a deep dive of my entire life, 62 years. What have I done right, wrong? How can I be a better person?” he said. “So now that I'm on the other side of it, I think it's been an experience worth going through. I'll be a better person.”",1,0,0
1533,"Kathleen Willey, one well known former mistress of Bill Clinton, among an estimated 2,000 women over the course of his political career, was asked if she would attend Monday’s Presidential debate if invited by Trump. Her response? “I would refrain for now. Let her do herself in on her own.” She continued, explaining that if every woman Bill Clinton had an affair with over the years was present at the debates, it would fill the hall. See her comment below: “Most of us are well known and our stories have been repeated several times over the years, but what concerns me the most are the voices of my sisters who are still afraid to come out of the darkness. I have communicated with a number of them and they are still terrified of publicly sharing their experiences with the Clintons. The real story here is not one of our presence in the front row at any of these debates, but the unhindered lust for power that the Clintons have displayed for decades. Hillary Clinton has lied, cheated and stolen our lives from us. People have died in her wake of deceit. We could fill the entire audience. I would like to see the day when these women can step into the light and share their stories of brutality, terror and intimidation without the kind of fear of intimidation and recrimination that we have experienced for far too many years.” The Clinton machine has spent years terrorizing Bill’s mistresses. And much of that was orchestrated by Hillary, who, for all intents and purposes is the attack dog that keeps her husband from having to answer for his sleazy lifestyle.   Hillary would be a shameful President and an exceedingly poor example to our daughters. She models the “break the rules to get ahead” mentality. Just being a woman does not make her a good role model. American women and girls deserve better. They deserve a woman President who is honest. And Hillary certainly isn’t. No matter who sits in the front row at the debate, Hillary will still be there; lying, fabricating, screeching and coughing…and that’s just the introductions. Trump will wipe the floor with Wicked Hillary. And all those women victimized by Bill and Hillary over the years will be laughing hysterically. What goes around, comes around.

Given her now notorious propensity for being constantly “confused,” Hillary probably thought the man was saying “Hillary for president!,” but nothing could be further from the truth. The “Hillary for prison!” meme has been going on now for some time. Born out of a frustration that she has not been held accountable for even the slightest of her crimes, the slogan reflects the mood of America. And Trump has capitalized on it brilliantly. ‘Hillary for Prison 2016’ has become the theme of the Grand Old Party – Americans see what the Hildabeast is… the most corrupt politician to ever run for office in our country. Since the GOP convention, it has been the rallying cry of those who support Donald Trump and even those who don’t. Hillary’s own associates and friends say that she is corrupt beyond belief. Between the scandals plaguing Clinton and her severe health issues, Trump is now leading her in the polls. And with the renewed terrorism threats and the support of the police union, Trump is sure to surge even further ahead. Clinton looks frail, weak and tainted… if the country is besieged by terrorist attack after attack, they will turn to a strongman like Donald Trump and beg for his leadership. God help us. America is changing and not for the better. Be careful what you wish for, you may just get it.   ",0,0,1
767,"One of the greatest progressive liberals of our time is Senator Elizabeth Warren. She is notably good friends with Senator Bernie Sanders. However, she is most known for her blatant lie about having Native American ancestry. Which she used in order to gain scholarships and wrote down in numerous collegiate and professional books to take advantage of minority support groups. Conservatives will never let her live it down and justifiably so. A college student confronted her at an event where he took a video of her and when he confronted her about lying about her ethnicity she literally ran away. Like a kid who got their hand caught in the cookie jar. Watch here,  They were both at an event at Ohio State University where Warren was campaigning wits Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland for Hillary Clinton. They called for people to vote for Hillary Clinton and partake in voting on the state level but to also build a Senate dominated by Democrats. The young student confronted Warren about losing big to Donald Trump to which she retorted they weren’t. But that was not enough for the young man. When Warren insisted they were going to beat Trump the student yelled to her that she lied about her ethnicity to get a scholarship. You could see the smoke behind her she ran away so fast. As the saying goes, if you want to upset a conservative them lie to the, but if you want to hurt a liberal then tell them the truth. Donald Trump got flack in the press for calling her out on the same thing too. He referenced her when he called her Pochahontas. An obvious sarcastic jab at her previous deception about her ethnicity. But you reap what you sew and what goes around comes around. The best part is they aren’t lying, they’re telling the truth. Warren lied and she can run but she certainly cannot hide from that. ",0,0,1
477,"Washington (CNN)The Senate will vote Wednesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill to give victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attacks the legal right to sue Saudi Arabia for any purported role in the plot, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. The measure will need a two-thirds vote of the chamber to succeed -- which is expected -- before going to the House for a similar override vote later this week. It would be the first time in Obama's nearly eight years in office that one of his vetoes will be overturned. The President opposes the bill because he says it could open the door to lawsuits against the US for actions taken by military service members, diplomats and others. Obama expressed sympathy for the 9/11 families in his veto message Friday, but said he vetoed the bill because the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism ""out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts."" In recent days, several senators who allowed the bill to pass without objection expressed misgivings for their decisions and said they wanted to find a way to address the White House's concerns about sovereign immunity. ""I have tremendous empathy for the victims,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said two weeks ago. ""At the same time I have concerns about the precedent this bill will set and what it may mean to American service men and women and others. Let's face it -- our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in Pakistan. Our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in Afghanistan. And I think once you start opening the door for these types of activities it can be very problematic."" Despite those second thoughts, there was never much traction among lawmakers to prevent the override. Heavy lobbying by the Saudi government, which opposed the bill, was met by a more powerful force -- the emotional appeal of the 9/11 families who fanned out on Capitol Hill in recent weeks to prevent the bill from stalling. Once both chambers override the veto, the bill becomes law regardless of Obama's opposition. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",1,0,0
766,"For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows. Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion. The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder): The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them. No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life. Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.” Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead. Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim! How insane is this? Get the word out – share this post on Facebook and Twitter. ",0,0,1
228,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last nightâs debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be? Hereâs to answer that question: Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Mondayâs debate? â Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016  Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outletâs usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links. Thereâs also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last nightâs poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls. Of course, the Trumpkins arenât happy with at all for blowing those delusions out of the water: @HuffingtonPost someoneâs upset that #Trumpwins â Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016  @HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? â Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016  Hope no one at Clemson got triggered for seeing this racist tweet. @HuffingtonPost pic.twitter.com/0KxxsNnMh5 â Michael Benson (@KeyMrB) September 27, 2016  @HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ð¢ pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y â Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016  And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesnât show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway: I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate â except for the little watched @CNN poll. â Donald J.

559,"Trump supporters not only come in all shapes, colors, and sizes, they come from all around, even outside the United States. At Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta – that’s in Canada for those of our readers who are Gary Johnson supporters…(just kidding!) – student Matt Linder was wearing a red Trump hat with the campaign’s slogan “Make America Great Again” on the front. Even though they’re Canadian, he and his friend both happen to be very interested in American politics, and are both supporters of Donald Trump. But other students felt their safe space severely violated by this red hat, with one Zoe Slusar demanding that he remove it, because “it’s hate language on campus.” Heat Street reported on the incident: “You’re not allowed to share hate language at a University,” Slusar shouted at Linder. “Make America Great Again means Make America all for white people, no immigrants, no people of different sexual orientations. “You’ve got to take the hat off or I am going to write the president of the University,” she continues. “It’s not allowed. It’s hate language on campus.” The video ends when another man (presumably a student) snatches the hat from Linder’s head and absconds with it. Slusar left this description on her Facebook page, but it has since been deleted: Today I got into an altercation with a guy wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. I went up and asked him if he would take the hat off, explaining a university should be a safe space. It was impossible to communicate to him why wearing a hat in support of a movement grown on the seeds of racism, bigotry and exclusion of diversity (sexual and cultural) could make some people afraid. People came out of the woodwork around us to support the hat, and after insulting me, they began filming my “crazy” behaviour at asking him to not wear the hat on campus. The video was posted and I made the mistake of reading the comments. I am so deeply saddened… I don’t want to draw anymore attention to the dysfunctional pawns that are being used by a system of power to oppress others. I do want to state that I stand by my belief that every space, but especially university spaces, should be made to make everyone feel SAFE. We need to seriously change our culture. We need to equally support and express movements and gestures of inclusive acceptance. I walked outside after the altercation, which ended up involving security and more concern for someone’s “private property” then about anti-oppression and overt racism, feeling totally hopeless. Only to find the anti-abortion group posing with their graphic images and slogans of “sin”. But… Beside them was a group of courageous and beautiful humans, holding signs of “we support your choice” and kindly warning oncoming students about the graphic images so they could be avoided. (Thank you Aalayna Spence, Nathan Lawley and crew.) It makes me cry that there will always be battles of “right” and “wrong”… There will always be opposing parties… Unfortunately for many people life does not exist without fear of oppression, violence or attack. But there are some warriors, who are not too tired. Some humans who want anyone being attacked (be it blatant or subtle) to know they are equally being a supported. I’m ready to make some noise YYC. I’m ready for some LOUD AF language of LOVE. That is the only thing that might have a chance of helping the world. So be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are. #peace She seems to be a walking contradiction. She wants everyone to “be a warrior and express your support for those who are attacked everyday because of who they are.” But that’s exactly what she did to the Trump supporter student. She attacked him, because of who he was. And not only that, she attacked him based on stereotypes created by the media of Trump and his supporters.

2,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge. The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.       A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings. Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey. One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend. Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.   The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there. ""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home."" Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents. Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.   In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted. Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks. Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney. A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.   ABC News' Cindy Galli, Megan Christie, Randy Kreider, Alex Hosenball and Cho Park contributed to this report. [Editor's Note Sept. 28, 2016: The original version of this report said that Ahmad Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000. Rahami's father later told ABC News, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that Rahami received his Green Card in 2000.]",1,0,0
404,"Washington (CNN)Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump. ""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said. On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump. ""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them."" Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party. Yet if Cruz backs Trump now, he'll be accused of political opportunism and anger his core supporters who hailed his controversial speech at the Republican National Convention where he pointedly declined to endorse his party's nominee. It would mean embracing a man who during the primaries taunted the senator with the nickname ""Lyin' Ted,"" suggested Cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his Canadian birthplace, and speculated that Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. Cruz risks getting little credit for backing Trump belatedly, while turning off the anti-Trump wing of the party that is bound to become more vocal -- and potentially more powerful -- if Clinton wins the White House. ""He's in a box,"" said one senior Senate Republican. Yet, Trump has hired key Cruz allies, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and spokesman Jason Miller. And in a sign of a thawing of relations, Trump on Wednesday expressed support for a Cruz-backed, Internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the Senate. Cruz tweeted his appreciation for Trump. But when the Senate dropped the language from the government funding bill Thursday, the Texas Republican stayed mostly quiet in the chamber -- a departure from his usually outspoken style. In recent days, Cruz has been making comments of the GOP nominee that are emblematic of the tightrope he's trying to walk. He is declining to say if he would formally offer his endorsement of Trump, but argued that Clinton should never be elected president. In effect, he's trying to show that he is willing to help the party without formally giving his blessing to Trump. ""My focus is on defeating Hillary Clinton and helping preserve a Senate Republican majority,"" Cruz told CNN. ""Because we need a federal government that is devoted to defending the Constitution, to defeating radical Islamic terrorism and keeping this country safe."" Asked if that meant he could endorse Trump before November, Cruz added: ""I've given you my answer."" A Cruz aide told CNN that the senator has not made a decision yet on whether to endorse Trump but has never ruled out the possibility, even if he previously called the GOP nominee a ""serial philanderer,"" ""utterly amoral,"" and ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen. ""He thinks about it every day,"" Cruz's former campaign Jeff Roe, who was Cruz's campaign manager, told reporters at a Bloomberg event this week. ""I'm hoping there's still time for him to come forward, or I think he and all the other people you named will be left in the rear view mirror of the Republican Party moving forward,"" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, told radio talk show host Laura Ingraham this week. Working with fellow senators The back-and-forth comes as Cruz is trying to showcase a more collaborate style in the Senate in recent weeks. After calling his colleagues part of a corrupt ""Washington cartel,"" criticizing their convictions and battling them over policy and tactics for three years, he has, in the words of one of his colleagues, made ""nice."" He transferred $100,000 over to the National Republican Senatorial Committee recently. And next month, he is joining the senior Texas senator, John Cornyn, to headline two fundraising events in Houston and Dallas for GOP senators up for reelection, including Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. ""We're working on that together,"" Cornyn said. Cruz himself may need help from his fellow lawmakers in two years. He faces a possible 2018 Senate primary challenge from Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who has increasingly made an issue of Cruz's failure to endorse Trump. ""I mean, [Cruz] pledged to support him,"" McCaul told Ingraham this week. ""He broke his word."" CNN's Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.",1,0,0

When asked then if he thought Trump is a racist, Reid responded: ""All you guys have a job to do. You make that decision. I'm not going to."" Previously, Reid excoriated Trump from the Senate floor, calling him a ""spoiled brat,"" ""a con artist"" and a ""human leech who will bleed the country."" And at a September 13 news conference Reid ripped Trump for being overweight and over his eating habits, charging that the media ""magnified"" Hillary Clinton's recent bout with pneumonia. ""Take a look at this character that's running for president. He complains about her health. What does he do? He's 70 years old. He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit,"" Reid said. Sean Spicer, communications director and adviser for the Republican National Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that he was ""almost speechless"" over Reid's remarks. ""There is a good thing Harry Reid is retiring because I think the people of Nevada and the people of this country have had it with Harry Reid,"" he said. ""Nevada is continuing to trend for Donald Trump. So if he thinks Donald Trump is a racist, then he thinks the majority of Nevada thinks so, too ,and I think that's pretty sad.""

After a lengthy firefight which left one police officer with non-life threatening wounds, Ahmad Khan Rahami was taken into custody in Linden, New Jersey. The police said there was “conclusive” evidence that Rahami was connected to several other devices that had failed to detonate. They were able to identify him from photos on a cellphone that had been used as a detonator but did not explode. Rahami is a naturalized citizen, born in Afghanistan in 1988. It is unclear whether or not he was a refugee or when he came to the United States. He lived in Elizabeth, NJ, where his family operated a fried chicken restaurant. Regulars at the First American Fried Chicken resturaunt described Mr. Rahami as “friendly,” noting that he dressed in Western clothing and was obsessed with “fast cars.” There are no connections as of yet to the any international terror or any indication of religious radicalization. While Republican nominee Donald Trump will surely use this as an excuse to double down on his anti-Muslim and anti-refugee platform, it should be noted that thanks to the vigilance of American citizens and the rapid response of law enforcement, there have been no deaths from the bombings and the suspect was captured extremely quickly. No change of our already lengthy vetting process would have prevented Mr. Rahami from entering the country; the parts of the IEDs are purchasable at any hardware store.

647,"Sheriff Parnell McNamara For the vast majority of normal individuals, it wasn’t all that long ago, when we heard a phrase such as “all lives matter” we thought of it as a positive loving encompassing an inclusive statement, in that everyone’s life had purpose and should be celebrated regardless of race, age, sexual orientation or gender. Now fast forward to today and that innocent phrase that might have been spoken just a few short years ago has taken a life all its own, among the politically correct and entitlement class. Leave it to progressives and race hustlers to cleverly create a subtext of words and phrases, specifically designed to change the underlying or implicit meaning of those words and phrases original intent. And that’s perhaps where McLennan County’s top law enforcement officer, Sheriff Parnell McNamara, finds himself. It seems that the hapless sheriff isn’t up to speed with the continued changes taking place within the race baiting world of political correctness, and he’s now paying the price. His “carnal sin” was to purchase a full-page ad, in the Hometown News that says “All Lives Matter,” which of course has set off a firestorm of protests from the usual cast of characters McNamara acknowledged he bought the ad because of what he believes, saying: “I remember talking to someone about ‘All Lives Matter,’ because it aggravated me when someone said ‘All Lives Matter’ is a racial slur. All lives matter. Your life matters, mine, police, John Q citizen. It doesn’t matter what color you are. Every human being has a right to live.” And no doubt most traditional Americans feel exactly the same way; however Sheriff McNamara works within a political environment where the political establishment sets the rules governed by what is currently politically correct, and publicly stating that “all lives matter” is now considered a racist statement within the bastions of progressive orthodoxy. And making that point was Jo Welter, Community Race Relations Coalition board chairman, saying; “You can say, ‘All lives matter,’ but the fact is throughout our history, and even currently, we do not value black lives as much as we do other lives.” Then Welter went on to carefully cherry pick data that bolstered his ridicules claim. “Black Lives Matter” is divisive and counterproductive, State Rep. Charles “Doc” Anderson said. “It doesn’t help the issues. It’s inflammatory, and I think it’s intended to be so,” he said. “Most members of the black community realize that all lives matter.” McNamara added, “I know of no police officer that puts his badge and gun on in the morning and goes to work wanting to hurt someone or kill someone,” he said. “We have black police officers that have been killed. It’s a movement against police out there that’s absolutely wrong.” Sheriff’s office Sgt. Lionel McGee, put it all together. He is a black police officer who does not support BLM. He said some in the BLM movement will never support police. He said, “I tell people all the time, the incident that sparked all this with Michael Brown in Ferguson, I probably would have done the same thing. You know, that’s what started it. The deal with (Eric) Garner in New York. He was 300-something pounds. I had this argument with my own sister. How come Mr. Garner couldn’t have said, ‘Hey, y’all caught me selling illegal cigarettes on the street. You got me and put my hands behind my back, and let’s go to jail.’ He’d still be alive today. “If somebody’s fighting and struggling with you and you’re trying to arrest them and you’re doing everything in your power to arrest them, and that person don’t want to go and they happen to die or get injured or get seriously hurt, I can’t see that as being my fault.” Do you agree with this Sheriff's ad that states ""All Lives Matter"" or is this an insult to the black community?

1088,"The latest shootings by police of black men show that little has been done to reduce the violence at the hands of law enforcement, Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson said on Wednesday, as he expressed frustration over the frequency of such incidents. ""Police kill almost three people everyday,"" McKesson told POLITICO, as unrest simmers over the two deaths of black men by police over the past week. ""We have to hold the police accountable for their actions."" Story Continued Below Protests shook the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, overnight and into the early morning after a black man was shot dead by police Tuesday night. The demonstrations, which at times turned violent, spilled over into the apartment complex where Keith Lamont Scott was killed. Charlotte police maintain that Scott stepped out of his vehicle with a gun when officers arrived at the scene, but his family disputes this claim, saying he was sitting in his car reading a book. The Charlotte Police Department could not be immediately reached for comment. The shooting comes as racial tensions were already high across the country after police shot dead an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma last week. Terence Crutcher's family says officer Betty Shelby inappropriately fired on him after their SUV broke down, while her lawyer contends that Crutcher was acting suspiciously and appeared to be reaching inside the vehicle for a gun. While the shootings have again grabbed national headlines – and attention from the two presidential candidates – McKesson said police need to start being held accountable for the violence, and that he hopes there are consequences for the officers in the most recent fatal shootings. ""[I'm] looking forward to how this plays out in terms of criminal charges,” said McKesson, who was an early leader of the Black Lives Matter movement and co-founded Campaign Zero, the first effort to organize activists around a set of policies to stop police violence. McKesson said while the federal government has a role to play in reforming police behavior, the onus is really on local departments to change their ways. ""What's he to say?"" he said when asked if President Barack Obama is doing enough to combat police violence, adding ""The Department of Justice could reduce funding to local police departments, and they haven't really done that aggressively.” In the meantime, McKesson said he would continue trying to draw attention to the issue. Campaign Zero on Wednesday launched a new project at useofforceproject.org, which takes a look at 91 of 100 police departments in the biggest cities in the United States. The report examines the use of force policies of the departments and concludes whether there are basic protections against police violence in the policies. ""Many police departments fail to establish common sense restrictions on police use of force — including deadly force — that would actually benefit the communities they are supposed to protect and serve,"" the report states. ""According to our findings, fundamentally changing use of force policies can dramatically reduce the number of people killed by police in America."" ""The police has a shadow system that almost guarantees they won't be held accountable,"" McKesson said, adding that these policies, and the lack of provisions to safeguard against police violence make it extremely difficult to reduce these incidents from recurring.",1,0,0
854,"Famed economist and former labor secretary Robert Reich posted an interaction he recently had with a Trump supporter that demonstrates just how deeply this ridiculous misconception that Donald Trump is a “good businessman” has sunk into the public consciousness.  The idea that we need a “successful businessman” as a President at all is very concerning. Businessmen only care about one thing – their profits, and increasing those profits. A nation-state is not a business, nor should it be run like one. The leader of a nation-state must care for the well-being of his people and balancing complex international relationships with other nation-states, concerns that don’t have anything to do with the single-minded obsession with profit. And of course, Trump is not a good businessman. He started out with a “small loan” of just a million dollars after being handed all the opportunities a straight white male needs to make it in America. He then lied, cheated and extorted his way to the top, and still managed to rack up four bankruptcies and over 3500 lawsuits. He is nothing but a con-man, and he will run our country into the ground just like he’s done his businesses.",0,1,0
1505,"Blue Bell just did the one thing we all hoped would never happen again, this is a nightmare. In 2015 we were all devastated when our favorite ice cream had a HUGE recall taking it off the shelves for months. This was their first recall in over 100 years! Eventually toward the end of 2016 we started seeing Blue Bell back out on the shelves, but now there has been another recall on the products!  The company is now voluntarily recalling several of their ice-cream products because they are concerned that they may contain “listeria bacteria”. Unfortunately, they have recalled two of their products that contain chocolate chip cookie dough. Blue Bell stated that the dough was being made by a third party known as Aspen Hills Inc. The good news is that there haven’t been any reports of illness from the ice cream but Blue Bell is wanting to take precautions before their are any. The company posted the recall on their Facebook yesterday. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily recalling select products that contain a chocolate chip cookie dough ingredient. Aspen Hills, Inc., who supplies us with this ingredient, has issued a voluntary recall on select lots of chocolate chip cookie dough supplied to Blue Bell. No illnesses have been reported to date, but Blue Bell is taking this step because we remain committed to producing a safe, high-quality, great-tasting ice cream for you and your family to enjoy.”  Apparently the ice cream was distributed in 10 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Blue Bell also posted a list of recalled products to ensure that no one is eating them. Blue Bell Ice Cream Half Gallons: Code Dates Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough 082618226 Blue Bell Cookie Two Step 080418222, 081818224 Blue Bell Ice Cream Pints: Code Dates Blue Bell Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough 081518242, 082418242 Aspen Hills Inc. wrote a letter about the recall stating that the contaminated cookie dough could cause fever, headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Not only that but if you are pregnant the infection can cause miscarriages and still-births. Blue Bell was sold in over 30 states before their huge recall last year, and some of those places are barely getting the ice cream back out on the shelves. One store in particular recited their shipment of Blue Bell only two days before the big recall! We’re all smiles in Raleigh, NC, because Blue Bell is back!

177,"As this bizarre election cycle heads into the home stretch, the issue of race relations in America has become almost all-consuming. Add the shootings of two black men in Tulsa and Charlotte by police and the fuse to the powder keg is remarkably short. As the left contends that systemic institutional racism is alive and well in this country, the right fires back with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. quotes to prove that it’s not. While liberals decry the shooting of unarmed black men as evidence of the violence and oppression inherent in the system, conservatives write it off not as black men being killed but rather as “thugs” getting what they deserve for “non-compliance.” One of the favorite pastimes of the modern conservative is to forget the due process afforded to all Americans under the constitution and instead convict them with their past records. Forgetting that institutional racism extends into police departments and court systems, making young black men more susceptible to arrest and conviction, we know about every instance of driving without a license, resisting arrest and jaywalking ever perpetrated by every black man ever shot and killed by police. Today, while looking through a Twitter feed at a Fox News report about Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby being charged with manslaughter for killing a man with his hands in the air, I came across a tweet that shows that racism is without a doubt alive and well in America: @foxandfriends@blp3pic.twitter.com/JmjD5DNCRA — Theresa (@VOTE_TRUMP_) September 23, 2016  Once again, conservatives feel the need to point out that the police officer who killed a man shouldn’t be held accountable because he was a very, very bad person. There’s only one problem here: the tweeted information is about the man killed in Charlotte, not Terence Crutcher, who was killed by the officer in question. My response was as simple as I could possibly make it: @VOTE_TRUMP_ @foxandfriends @blp3 Why is another man’s record relevant? Oh…because “they” are all the same, right? — ezekiel wilekenmeyer (@wilekenmeyer) September 23, 2016  Terence Crutcher being judged on the criminal record of Kieth Lamont Scott isn’t really that surprising, is it? What’s far less surprising is that nobody bothered to mention the mistake. That’s because my response was accurate. To the conservative racist, It makes no difference which black man was convicted of which crimes or that they were two different individuals separated by a dozen states who had never met. “They” are all the same. How fitting is it that her handle is “@VOTE_TRUMP_” Because…of course it is.",0,1,0
860,"A group of over fifty former intelligence officials and national security experts have written a letter demanding that he disclose the details of his “overseas business investments.” Signed by both Republicans and Democrats, the call for transparency comes as Trump defiantly doubles down on his refusal to release his tax returns and reveal any potential conflicts of interest he might have as President. “Donald Trump still has not revealed to the American public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting U.S. foreign policy. This is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation’s highest office. As such, we are calling on Mr. Trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas — to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. The Newsweek article reports that Mr. Trump courted Muammar Qaddafi, a dictator who murdered his own people and who once pursued nuclear weapons and conducted terrorism against Americans. Newsweek also asserts that Mr. Trump’s other business partners have included Kremlin-tied oligarchs and Russians with mafia links, an individual accused of money laundering for the Iranian military, a Turkish media tycoon accused of running a fuel-smuggling ring, Indian companies that may have violated India’s laws in their pursuit of business with Mr. Trump, and a South Korean company mired in scandal. Importantly, according to this news item, Mr. Trump’s business partnerships owe millions of dollars to Chinese entities. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list. He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies. He has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization. Our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America’s best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets.” The letter was penned by signatories as noted as former acting CIA director Michael J. Morell, former undersecretary of Defense Michael G. Vickers, and former national security adviser Samantha Vinograd. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns would appear to indicate that there are some serious irregularities that could potentially doom his candidacy for President, which his son pretty much confirmed in a foolish statement. The content of those tax returns has been the subject of much speculation, but given Trump’s long history of tax evasion and political bribery, it doesn’t take much imagination to assume he’s committing some kind of fraud. He’s also suspected of accepting bribes from Russian oligarchs and has done business with authoritarian rulers like Libya’s now-deceased Muammar Qaddafi, the emirs of the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s ruling House of Saud.

1132,"A House panel voted Thursday to hold Bryan Pagliano, a former technology aide to Hillary Clinton, in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the private email set-up Clinton used as secretary of state. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted 19-15 along party lines, to send a contempt resolution to the full House. The move against Pagliano took place despite repeated warnings from his attorney that the showdown was fruitless since the computer specialist would assert his Fifth Amendment rights in response to any questions that would be put to him. Story Continued Below ""Subpoenas are not optional,"" panel Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said after Pagliano failed to show up at the second committee hearing he was formally called to in the past two weeks. ""Mr. Pagliano is a crucial fact witness in this committee's investigation former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's of a private email server to conduct government business."" Democrats called the contempt citation and the demand for Pagliano's public appearance a transparent political ploy aimed at embarrassing Clinton as the presidential election enters its final stretch. ""Republicans want a photo op. They want a ready-made campaign commercial. No matter what anyone says, that is not a legitimate legislative purpose,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the panel's ranking Democrat. An attorney for Pagliano, Mark MacDougall, streesed that his client was ready to appear behind closed doors, but would not be part of a public spectacle. ""Bryan already asserted his Fifth Amendment right on the record before this Congress. He was ready to do it again today in Executive Session. But the Republicans voted for contempt because he wouldn’t play the role they had scripted - in the campaign ad that they wanted to tape six weeks before the election. That’s all there is to it,"" MacDougall said in a statement. The contempt resolution requires approval by the full House. It's unclear whether a vote on the measure will be scheduled before Congress takes its typical pre-election break. Congress has three ways to seek enforcement of a subpoena: by filing a civil lawsuit, by asking federal prosecutors to charge someone with criminal contempt, or by having someone jailed at the Capitol. It's unclear whether any of those methods will work here. A judge may not enforce the subpoena because of Pagliano's Fifth Amendment claims, prosecutors rarely pursue such cases, and Congress' own power to take witnesses into custody hasn't been used in about a century. Republicans said the credibility of the Congress was on the line in the dispute. Some painted the confrontation in grave, nearly apocalyptic, terms. ""We cannot have people come here and deny the right under the Constitution for us to question them. They may not want to answer and they have that right under the Constitution,"" Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.) said. ""If you continue that, you destroy the whole basis of our government."" Democrats also described the showdown as ominous, and said the panel itself might be damaged by the move. ""This is a waste of time. It’s destroying this committee. It’s destroying the reputation of this committee,"" said Del. Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands. Democrats repeatedly noted that last year Pagliano invoked his 5th Amendment rights in a closed session of the House Benghazi Committee. They noted his attorney offered to have Pagliano appear at a closed session, but Chaffetz declined. ""I don’t think it should be done behind closed doors,"" Chaffetz said. ""I think it’s the way this committee should operate."" However, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) said the law doesn't require witnesses to show up at a public hearing to assert their rights against self-incrimination. He said he wasn't too worried about the contempt resolution because he doubted any court would enforce it. ""I don’t think it’s going anywhere, and I take comfort in that fact,"" Lynch said. Chaffetz insisted he has different questions for Pagliano than the ones he refused to answer last year. However, Pagliano's lawyer has said he will refuse to answer any questions from the oversight panel. Democrats also persisted in arguments that the panel is trying to second-guess the FBI and Justice Department decision not to prosecute Clinton or anyone else. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said that claim smacked of hypocrisy, because Democrats have been at the forefront of questioning the FBI's decisions on issuing national security letters to demand information or not to prosecute bank executives over the 2008 economic collapse. ""God forbid we ask the FBI anything,"" Gowdy said sarcastically.",1,0,0
1606,"A cafeteria worker in a Pennsylvania school district just quit her job, saying the district’s new lunch policy is morally bankrupt. Stacy Koltiska turned in her resignation letter after being forced to throw away a child’s hot meal in front of a full cafeteria because his parents owed more than $25 to the Canon-McMillan school district, south of Pittsburgh. According to the Washington Post, the school board recently adopted the controversial new policy this fall to recoup thousands of dollars in debt owed to the district. “His eyes welled up with tears. I’ll never forget his name, the look on his face,” Koltiska wrote on her Facebook page after turning in her resignation. Koltiska, who worked the cash register at Wylandville Elementary School in Eighty Four, Pennsylvania, said the total cost of the hot meal was just $2.05, and that the policy required her to throw out the child’s hot meal and replace it with a sandwich made of two slices of white bread and a cold slice of government cheese. However, the student’s lunch account is still charged the standard $2.05 for the meal even if they had their hot lunch taken away. High school students don’t get a meal at all, under the new policy. “God is love, and we should love one another and be kind,” Koltiska told the . “There’s enough wealth in this world that no child should go hungry, especially in school. To me this is just wrong.” Koltiska blasted the policy as immoral, and the board members who passed it as indifferent to the plight of hungry children. “They’re suits at a board meeting,” she said. “They are not the ones facing a child and looking them in the eye and taking their food away.” Matthew Daniels, the superintendent of the Canon-McMillan district, told WTAE-TV the policy isn’t intended to shame hungry children, but to recoup lost revenue. Before the policy was implemented, Daniels said more than 300 families owed approximately $60,000 to $100,000 on their lunch accounts, collectively. Now, fewer than 70 families owe roughly $20,000. Daniels added that students on free or reduced lunch programs aren’t subject to the new policy. “There has never been the intent with the adoption of this policy to shame or embarrass a child,” he said. In a viral Facebook post, Koltiska implored readers to email Superintendent Daniels and Joni Mansmann, the district’s director of business and finance, and to ask them to repeal the policy.

7,"A Syrian human rights group said today that at least 32 people had been killed and dozens injured in Aleppo, Syria, and its western suburbs in the hours after Syria's military declared the U.S.-Russian brokered cease-fire over. After the Syrian military blamed rebels for not observing the truce, which was in its seventh day, the United Nations said a convoy transporting aid to the hard-hit city had been attacked, with 18 of the convoy's 31 trucks initially believed to have been hit. The rights group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that 12 people had been killed when the convoy was struck. Farhan Haq, a deputy spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, told ABC News that he could not confirm any information on potential casualties or the cause of the attack. He said that the United Nations' initial understanding was that a warehouse operated by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent had also been hit along with the convoy, before the trucks could distribute any aid to 78,000 people whom international groups had hoped to reach. The fighting came amid signs the cease-fire was falling apart, with Russia casting doubt on it and the Syrian military declaring its conclusion. But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking to reporters in New York City, disputed the notion that the cease-fire had ended and redirected his frustrations toward the Russians. ""We have not had seven days of calm and delivery of humanitarian goods, and so it'd be good if they didn't talk first to the press but if they talked to the people who are actually negotiating this,"" Kerry said. ""And I think it's -- as I said yesterday -- time to end the grandstanding and time to do the real work of delivering on the humanitarian goods that are necessary for access. So we just began today to see real movement of humanitarian goods, and let's see where we are, and we're happy to have a good conversation with them about how to proceed."" Kerry is in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly, where international leaders will discuss the world's refugee crisis in a large part caused by the five-year Syrian war. In a statement, State Department spokesman John Kirby stressed that the U.S. was waiting to hear from Russia on the current state of the cease-fire. ""While we have seen comments attributed to the Syrian military, our arrangement is with Russia, which is responsible for the Syrian regime's compliance, so we expect Russia to clarify their position,"" he said. Before today's declaration by the Syrian military, the cease-fire was already on shaky ground, with reports of violations on both sides. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the besieged city of Aleppo was hit by at least four airstrikes on Sunday. The group also reported that convoys carrying humanitarian aid shipments had not received permission to enter the city, which desperately needs them. Aleppo is home to nearly 2 million people who lack regular access to water and electricity. An estimated 250,000 to 275,000 people live in areas held by anti-government rebels that have been a focus of intense airstrikes and artillery bombardment.     Additionally, on Saturday the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS halted an airstrike in eastern Syria that the Russian Defense Ministry said killed 62 Syrian government soldiers and injured 100 others. A U.S. defense official told ABC News that the strike was supposed to target a collection of vehicles and personnel believed to belong to ISIS. The airstrike was halted after Russia communicated to the coalition that it was Syrian forces that were being struck. Australia, Denmark and the United Kingdom have acknowledged that their aircraft participated in the strike. A senior Obama administration official told ABC News that the U.S. ""relayed our regret"" to the Syrian government through Russian officials. According to a U.S. defense official, the leading theory is that the Syrian forces hit in the airstrike may have been conscripts or prisoners wearing civilian clothes, not regular Syrian Army uniforms. The cease-fire must be renewed every 48 hours. The last extension was on Friday. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",1,0,0
522,"""We won every poll. Virtually every poll,"" he told supporters Tuesday afternoon, challenging the media consensus that Hillary Clinton prevailed. Trump also promoted eleven of these so-called polls in a tweet, calling his wins in them ""such a great honor.""  But the things Trump called ""debate polls"" -- implying rigorous, scientific polling -- were informal web site surveys that invited anyone to respond. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told CNNMoney that the surveys are like ""junk food."" Meaningful national polls seek a diverse sample of respondents. The goal is to accurately represent the views of the country by accounting for differences in age, gender, party affiliations and other factors. That's not possible when anonymous web users fill out online surveys. People choose whether to participate, and they can vote multiple times, further warping the results. The only thing these surveys can measure, to a limited degree, is enthusiasm -- and some Trump supporters are definitely enthusiastic. But political scientists and researchers say it is a mistake to read much more than that into unscientific survey results. Early Tuesday morning, former Obama strategist David Plouffe tweeted that the online surveys cited by Trump are simply ""bogus."" Trump's proclivity for unscientific surveys was on display throughout the primary season. He frequently claimed that he ""won"" debates based on self-selecting polls conducted by web sites like The Drudge Report. Several respected news outlets -- Time, CNBC and Fortune to name three -- posted the surveys after Monday's debate, lending the unreliable practice an air of credibility. While sites like Time may value giving visitors a way to opine about the debate, Trump's embrace of the results ends up embarrassing both himself and the news outlet involved. ""These snap polls are just a way to feed the beast until the next batch of appropriately-conducted polls can come out to tell us if voters actually moved. It's like eating a junk food snack between meals,"" Anderson said. Trump's tweet also cited surveys from obscure web sites like ""PolitOpinion."" In one case on Tuesday, Trump even cited a poll that did not exist. ""I won CBS,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends."" CBS correspondent Major Garrett took to Twitter to clarify: ""We did not conduct a post-debate poll."" CBS did conduct a focus group of undecided voters, and Clinton came out ahead. Trump said on Fox that the survey results ""mean a lot"" to him, noting that hundreds of thousands of votes were cast on some of the web sites. That's true, but since people can vote multiple times -- and, with the right software, perhaps even more than that -- it isn't necessarily meaningful. Nevertheless, the surveys allow Trump and his aides to rail against media elite reactions to the debate and argue that voters are outsmarting pundits. And that's exactly what the campaign did on Tuesday. ""Trump won"" was the campaign's dominant social media message, citing the surveys as proof. Some political reporters called out the tactic. ‏""Trump's aggressive promotion of online (easily manipulated, non-scientific) polls saying he 'won' is a calculated effort to create a reality,"" Emily Flitter, who covers the Trump campaign for Reuters, tweeted. But the co-hosts of ""Fox & Friends,"" who are reliable cheerleaders for Trump, went along with Trump's talking point. Other Fox hosts also picked up on it, even though the network has its own well-regarded polling unit. Fox morning news anchor Martha MacCallum said debate watchers are ""leaning toward Donald Trump, and by pretty large margins in most of these viewer polls."" She called CNN's poll the ""outlier,"" showing Clinton as the clear winner among debate watchers. In fact, CNN/ORC's poll was one of the few polls conducted by professional researchers immediately following the debate. ""Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Trump had the better night,"" CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote, based on the findings of interviews with 521 registered voters. ""Although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as Democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed Clinton the winner."" Related: Post-debate poll: Hillary Clinton takes round one Conflating CNN's scientific poll with unscientific surveys, as both Trump and MacCallum did, is highly misleading. Some web sites, hungry for traffic, glommed on to the Trump-invented controversy. ""Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN's overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey,"" The Daily Mail web site said. Unhappy with the results of CNN's scientific poll, Trump criticized the network on Twitter, on Fox and at a campaign event. ""We won virtually every poll. Except for CNN. And nobody watches CNN,"" he said. About 10 million people watched the debate on CNN on Monday night. Overall, more than 80 million people tuned in on television, and millions more live-streamed the debate on the Internet.",1,0,0

According to LifeZette, a senior Trump campaign official, a president Trump would consider using assets seized from Mexican drug cartels to finance the construction. You have to admire this type of thinking; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities. A wall is not the only solution, but consider what the wall does. Trumps wall would cost around $8-10 billion dollars, money that could spur the economy. Next, the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into America. The objective of the wall is to force people to use our LEGAL immigration system. The plan reportedly would involve “joint border security fund,” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the border wall “to the benefit of both Mexico and the United States.” The funding? The Justice Department seized $8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone, according to an audit. There’s no telling how much we’ve accumulated. Further, that figure doesn’t include assets seized by the Mexican government. The wall represents an attack on the drug cartels. These groups menace Mexico, and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the United States. The wall begins the fight against corruption, drugs, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and terrorism in one fell swoop. “For decades, the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless Mexicans and Americans,” an anonymous Trump immigration adviser said. “It would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good.” Trump thinks differently than Washington. His type of thinking is what America needs. H/T Newsmax ",0,0,1
989,"In a rational world, we would interpret the inept crimes of accused pipe bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami as evidence that 15 years after the big one, the terrorist threat in America is akin to a brush fire—the kind of thing that inevitably flares up and causes some damage before the experts put it out. Instead, thanks to the cable news channels and some in the Web and print space, we’ve turned it into a mighty conflagration. Donald Trump, ever the opportunist, sounded this alarm Saturday shortly after the bomb went off in Manhattan’s Chelsea district. “Nobody knows exactly what’s going on. But boy, we are living in a time—we better get very tough, folks,” Trump said, when the shrapnel was still sizzling. The cable news channels jumped on the story in a galvanic fashion for a number of reasons. First, the story happened in their New York backyard. It is an unwritten rule of assaults, murders, natural disasters and other injurious acts that their news potential is inversely proportional to the distance from the news organization’s headquarters. For example, if a pipe bomb went off in Kansas City, the news response of the New York-based networks would be middling. But if a New York City cop broke his toe kicking a suspect in the butt, we’d be just a few chyrons away from a breaking news alert. Story Continued Below Second, the detonation of one bomb is an indicator that additional bombs might exist until proved otherwise. In this case, they did, in alarming numbers. The multiplicity of devices—one bomb exploded in New Jersey on Saturday morning, a second bomb was found (undetonated) in Manhattan, and then early Monday in New Jersey a third bomb went off in the face of a police robot—gave the story additional velocity like booster stages on a rocket. Third, the date 9/11 has made us all a little anxious about a repeat attack in September, and this anxiety helps to stoke coverage of any such incident—especially in New York. Even if the networks were based in Chicago, the story would have become big news: Terrorism is to New York as hurricanes are to Miami. Even the near-misses are big stories. So, measured by the usual yardsticks, nobody can deny that the New York bombing story and the capture of the accused were big stories. I’d be the last person to say the press “over-covered” an incident in which 29 people were injured. But neither am I carrying a load of dread that the next pipe bomb will ignite in my world—the Washington, D.C., metro area, another bull's-eye for terrorists. Living, as I do, in a rational world, I interpret the clumsy bombing and misfire, and the speedy apprehension of the suspect, as evidence that the genuine threat from terrorists is low. Very low. I feel safe unless I start watching TV, after which, if I let my reptilian brain take over, I feel a bit panicked. You probably feel the same way. After all, there’s no cost to overreacting to the minor threat of terrorism. The payoff for overreacting could be the preservation of your life. President Barack Obama has tried to convey this gist of the low threat a number of times, but whenever he tries to assure the country, it comes out sounding like he’s counseling us to put our heads in the sand. Then, opportunists like Trump do us no favor by inflating the event into something it isn’t. “Once again someone we were told is OK turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people—how did he get thru system?” Trump tweeted Monday afternoon. The fact that the 28-year-old Rahami, born in Afghanistan, is the naturalized son of an immigrant seems not to have penetrated Trump's coiffure. If Rahami “got through the system,” he did so as a youth. The current spate of violence doesn’t even come close to the volume of bombings recorded by FBI statisticians in an 18-month period spanning 1971 and 1972, Bryan Burrough reports in his book Days of Rage. Despite more than 2,500 domestic bombings in that period, the nation did not lose its marbles; no demagogue campaigned on the peril they posed. Because fear is not rational, wonks never get too far with the public by explaining that backyard swimming pools, quick drives to the supermarket for bread and milk, obesity or falling furniture are more likely to put your in death’s cross hairs than an act of terrorism. In the current atmosphere, every terror-motivated crime has come to feel like a dire assault on the homeland, exploding in the news with much more success than the actual bombs involved. Though the fear is understandable, the result has a huge distorting effect on our national psyche and politics. The culture appears to be too scarred by the 9/11 attacks to place pressure-cooker bombs of the type that Rahami is alleged to have built in their proper perspective. Maybe the next generation, one with no direct memory of the attack, can guide us out of our paranoia. The fact is, everywhere you look in modern life, we’re safer. Airline flight is safer, cars are ridiculously safe, violent crime has fallen through the floor, the food supply has never been safer, and consumer devices come with so many safety doodads attached that it takes an act of determined negligence to cut off a finger or put out an eye. Helmeted to avoid concussions, GPS'ed up the wing-wang to make it impossible to get lost in the forest, protected by surveillance cameras around the clock, we now live in a fully airbagged world, where accidental death is blocked by technology at almost every juncture. The paradox of all this safety is that it ends up making a lot of us feel all the more unsafe when we’re reminded that random tragedies do happen—and to clamor for an even bigger airbag when they do, even though the rational mind tells us we’ve reached a diminishing point of returns on that investment. I’m not counseling anybody to “get over” 9/11 and slough off new attacks as if they’re pinpricks. But neither am I encouraging everybody to throw themselves into a full 9/11 wallow every time a bomb explodes, even if it blows up right in Manhattan. The low, low risk that a terrorist attack might injure you may not deserve the round-the-clock coverage the current incident is getting. It deserves some, and the press should feel free to pick on the 9/11 scab as much as it likes—but it’s not too much to ask the press to toss a little ointment and a bandage on the wound every now and then. ******* My autobiography will be titled A Little Ointment and a Bandage.

275,"Washington (CNN)Republicans are preparing for the penalty phase of the 2016 election. The next Republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman Reince Priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former GOP 2016ers who haven't yet endorsed Donald Trump: ""Get on board"" or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again. The nudge -- aimed at Republicans such as John Kasich, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush -- was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. Several Republican party chairs in early voting states told CNN that Priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 GOP candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee. Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcast ""I can't tell you how many people have asked me, 'What are you going to do about these candidates that are not keeping their promise?'"" Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann told CNN Monday. He said the Iowa state GOP receives 10 to 20 calls per week from rank-and-file Republicans wondering what, specifically, the party will do to force Kasich, Cruz and Bush to stick to their pledges and back Trump. ""If I'm hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in DC,"" said Kaufmann, who has spoken with Priebus and other Republican officials about enforcing the pledge. ""There's no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored."" A representative for Priebus didn't comment on the conversations. But his call for penalties wasn't widely embraced -- with the No. 2 House Republican breaking with Priebus Tuesday morning. ""There's a better way to unite people. I'm not a big believer that punishment unites people,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the Capitol. The California Republican added, ""If Hillary (Clinton) can't unite Republicans, I don't think anything can."" Premature conversation? Of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if Trump wins. The race between Trump and Clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the Democratic nominee still has more paths to the White House. But the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the GOP if Trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction. The anatomy of a white, working-class Trump voter ""We're watching the trailer for the GOP civil war, out in theaters November 9,"" said a top Republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with Priebus. The penalty talk spilled into the open Sunday, when Priebus told John Dickerson on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that members of the 2016 Republican presidential field who haven't yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed Trump need to ""get on board."" And for those who don't, he said future presidential bids won't ""be that easy."" ""If a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don't follow through with the promises that they made in that process,"" Priebus said, ""what should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?"" Kasich's camp quickly zipped off a response accusing Priebus of putting party over principles. Kasich strategist John Weaver said the Ohio governor ""will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" Cruz brushed Priebus off Tuesday evening. ""These are serious times. I think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between Republicans,"" he said. ""My focus is on defeating Hillary Clinton and helping preserve a Senate Republican majority."" The RNC's leverage Penalties, several Republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the Republican National Committee's data and voter files -- and potentially bans from primary debates. Individual states, though, likely couldn't keep candidates off their ballots. Still, Republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging Kasich, Cruz, Bush and others to support Trump in 2016 -- not to handicap the party's presidential candidates in the future. Some said it's not even clear the RNC would have authority to impose the crackdown Priebus discussed. ""Reince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet -- and I'm not sure that the question deserves an answer. That's to be determined,"" said Matt Moore, the South Carolina GOP chairman. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn't abide by their pledges to support Trump. ""We are focused on winning back the White House and maintaining our majorities in the House and Senate,"" Walters said in an email. Donald Trump opens the personal insult vault (again) While some party honchos like Kaufmann backed Priebus' warning shot, others -- including Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges -- bristled. ""No. This is not what we are all about as a party. Besides, let's stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days,"" Borges tweeted Sunday night. Top Mitt Romney 2012 strategist Stuart Stevens tweeted: ""So idea is most popular recent Republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? Great plan."" RNC's handling of Trump The RNC's handling of Trump under Priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair -- or extends the Wisconsin operative's tenure -- shortly after the election. Then comes a swing-state governor's race in Virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where Trump's brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. And in 2020, the early stages of the Republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated Trump. It would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like Mike Pence, the Indiana governor who became Trump's running mate and chief defender, and Cruz, the Texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse Trump at his own nominating convention. ""Assuming Trump loses, there'll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party,"" said Weaver, the Kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to Priebus on Sunday. ""You're going to have off-year elections, you're going to have midterms -- some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. But you won't have any new definition of it until there's a new nominee,"" Weaver said. ""There's a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go."" Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOP Many Republicans still fault Priebus for failing to criticize Trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all Muslims from entering the United States, and believe the party could have done more to slow Trump's rise. They point out a particular irony: The party that insisted it couldn't intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who helmed Cruz's state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that ""circumstances change"" -- a reference to the pledge's creation as a tool to keep Trump from launching an independent campaign. He said he doesn't see how Priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. ""There's no provisions in the RNC rules that allow anybody to punish anybody,"" Anuzis said. ""The idea of doing that, I think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",1,0,0
833,"Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem has permeated professional and now youth sports. Everyone is taking sides and it is not pretty. Many feel it is disrespectful to veterans to not stand while others view it as a meaningful protest to bring attention to what they call the oppression of African American people. Now a Navy Sailor came forward via social media to make a statement about the protests that many will not like. The Independent Journal Review reported, “Last week, as tensions increased following two highly publicized police shootings, another sailor came forward to say that she would be sitting out the national anthem as well.” Read her statement and look at her picture below that she posted to Facebook.   She indicates in her little statement that she was punished simply for defending the constitution but that is false. She was punished for violating Navy regulations. Regulations that she is well aware of. Navy regulations indicate that all uniformed personnel must stand at attention towards the ensign when the national anthem is played. It is the military after all. When that regulation is violated then a disciplinary action can be taken. While having the right to do something allows you to that doesn’t mean you are immune from punishment. As is the case here. She had the right to do it, but she was punished because she broke the rules of the pledge she took when she enlisted into the Navy. One felbow Navyman Martin Baker noted that in basic training they are taught their duty is to preserve and defend freedom and the constitution not practice it. He is also an African American. While Ervin has preserved and defended freedom she is not within her rights to practice it. Is that fair? Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. But that is what she signed up for so she shouldn’t be complaining about it now when she knew what she was getting herself into. ",0,0,1
1289,"Hillary Clinton drew applause Monday night for taking a shot at Donald Trump over having prepared for the first presidential debate – and similarly preparing “to be president.” Trump talked about his visits to “the inner cities” during a debate segment about race and policing but couldn’t resist also taking a shot at Clinton, who spent multiple days preparing for the debate in recent weeks. Story Continued Below “I just left Detroit, I just left Philadelphia. You've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's okay. I will tell you, I've been all over,” Trump said. “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president.

1080,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling. It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Story Continued Below The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever."" On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered. “The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said. After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk. “We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said. Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office. But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night. “I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?” Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences. At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd. Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach. “I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit. Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents. ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?” King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference. King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely. “Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans. “I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said. When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.” Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.” “The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.” Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.” Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t. “They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”",1,0,0
773,"A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings. Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said, “Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.” The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting. Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit. The lawsuit says, “During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.” Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too. Part of the handout reads, “Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.” It referenced the jihad as, “a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.” This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. Despite the fact the Thomas More Center has taken on this case neither the American Civil Liberties Union or the Freedom From Religion Foundation have weighed in on the issue.       ",0,0,1
218,"Donald Trump spent Monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. We were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. From lies to self-incrimination, watching the GOP nomineeâs performance was the equivalentÂ of one facepalm after another. So here you go, aÂ complete listÂ of every batshit crazy thing that came out of Donald Trumpâs mouth during the first presidential debate: âThereâs nobody in our government to fight them [China], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight.â Â  âTheyâre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing.â Â  âWe have to stop these countries from stealing our companies.â Â  âOur countryâs in deep trouble. Â We donât know what weâre doing with devaluationsâ¦ Especially when it comes to China, theyâre the best. Â Theyâre the best ever at it. What theyâre doing to us is a very very sad thing.â Â  âThatâs called business, by the way.â (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) Â  âIâm a great believer in all forms of energyâ¦ Our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.â Â  âI will bring back jobs. Â You canât bring back jobs.â Â  âThatâs about all youâve got.â (referring to Clintonâs book We Are Stronger Together) Â  âYou are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. Â You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. Â You are going to drive businesses out.â Â  âIâm going to cut taxes, big-league. Â You are going to raise taxes, big-league.â Â  âAnd take a look at mine also.â (referring to his campaign website) Â  âShe tells us how to fight ISIS on her website. Â I donât think Douglas MacArthur would like that too muchâ¦ Youâre telling the enemy everything you want to do. Â No wonder youâve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.â Â  âWell, Iâm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. Â Theyâre going to expand their companies. Â Theyâre going to do a tremendous job.â (hahahaha) Â  âIâm getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look, itâs really not a great thing for the wealthy, itâs really a great thing for middle class.â (methinks thou dost protest too much) Â  âThese people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies. Â And when theyâre going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where they canât bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton wonât allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.â (or because those companies are greedy and un-American, just saying) Â  âSo, what theyâre doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not, theyâre leaving our country because the taxes are too high. Â Because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they canât work out a deal. Â And everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that theyâre leaving our country to get their money because they canât bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape. Â Because they canât get together, because we have a President that canât sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.â Â (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we donât need to cut valuable public services) Â  âWe have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with Secretary Clintonâ¦ Why not [blame Clinton for everything]?â Â  âWeâre in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market.â Â  âWe have a FED that is doing political thingsâ¦ the FED is being more political than Secretary Clintonâ Â  âWhen we have a country thatâs doing so badly, thatâs being ripped off by every single country in the world, itâs the kind of thinking that our country needs.â Â  âWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.â (in response to a question about his taxes) Â  âIâve been under audit for almost 15 years. Â I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. Â I say, âHave you been audited?â Â I get audited almost every year, and in a way I should be complaining. Â Iâm not even complaining. Â I donât mind it. Â Itâs almost become a way of life. Â I get audited by the IRS, but other people donât.â Â  âWe have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of. Â I will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishesâ¦â Â  âThat makes me smart.â (in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes) Â  âI could give you a list of banks, if that would help you. Â I would give you a list of banks. Â These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. Â I could do that very quickly.â Â  âI have a tremendous income. Â The reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.â Â  âItâs about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.â Â  âOur airports are like from a third world countryâ¦ Weâve become a third world country. Â The worst of all things has happened.â Â  âAnd itâs really a shame. And itâs politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Weâre a debtor nation. Weâre a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we donât have the money, because itâs been squandered on so many of your ideas.â Â  âIt would be squandered, too, believe me.â (in response to not paying any federal income taxes) Â  âMaybe he didnât do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his workâ¦ Which our country should do, too.â (referring to not paying people who worked for him) âBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didnât get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Â Now, if you want to change the laws, youâve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Iâm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And thatâs what I do.â (referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts) âBut what she doesnât say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. Iâll give you an example. Weâre just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I donât get there one way, Iâm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.â Â  âWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.â Â  âWell, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesnât want to use a couple of words, and thatâs law and order. And we need law and order. If we donât have it, weâre not going to have a country.â Â  âNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.â Â  âWe have to be â we have to know what weâre doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.â Â  âNo, youâre wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where itâs allowed.â (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) Â  âWe need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by whatâs happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And itâs very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.â Â  âI have the endorsement of the NRA, which Iâm very proud of. These are very, very good people.â Â  âBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldnât be on there, weâll help them, weâll help them legally, weâll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.â Â  âBut stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.â Â  âTheyâve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because thatâs what it is. Theyâve controlled these communities for up to 100 years.â Â  âYou know, youâve seen me, Iâve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and thatâs OK. But I will tell you, Iâve been all over. And Iâve met some of the greatest people Iâll ever meet within these communities.â Â  âWhen I got involved, I didnât fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So Iâm satisfied with it. And Iâll tell you why Iâm satisfied with itâ¦Â But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good jobâ¦Â Well, it was very â I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.â Â  âBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that Iâve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. Â And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusionâ Â  âAnd I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.â Â  âFirst of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. Â And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesnât work that way. You were after him.â Â  âNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fatherâs company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country â it was a federal lawsuit â were sued. We settled the suit with zero â with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.â Â  âAnd, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I donât do on you. Maybe Iâm trying to save the money.â Â  âBut, frankly, I look â I look at that, and I say, isnât that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and itâs just one of those things.â Â  âIâll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And itâs a tremendously successful club. And Iâm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And Iâm very, very proud of it. And thatâs the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.â Â  âIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. Theyâve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE.â Â  âAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps weâre not. I donât think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. Sheâs saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I donât â maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?â Â  âNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we donât know, because the truth is, under President Obama weâve lost control of things that we used to have control over.â Â  âWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyâre beating us at our own game. ISIS.â Â  âSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is â it is a huge problem. I have a son. Heâs 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, itâs unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe itâs hardly doable.â Â  âBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But thatâs true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do betterâ¦Â and certainly cyber is one of them.â Â  âSo she talks about taking them out. Sheâs been doing it a long time. Sheâs been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnât have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnât have had them.â (speaking about the creation of ISIS) Â  âOr, as Iâve been saying for a long time, and I think youâll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil â and we should have taken the oil â ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil â a lot of the oil in Libya.â Â  âWrongâ¦ Wrong. Â Wrong.â Â  âThe secretary said very strongly about working with â weâve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyoneâs ever seen.â Â  âBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, thatâs another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now theyâre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyâre going.â Â  âNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arenât paying their fair share. Number two â and that bothers me, because we should be asking â weâre defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyâre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.â Â  âAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because â and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest â but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.â Â  âAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thatâs great. And I think we should get â because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Itâs a lot of money to protect other people. But Iâm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. Â And theyâre going to do that. And that was â believe me â Iâm sure Iâm not going to get credit for it â but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.â Â  âAnd believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldnât believe it. They sat back probably and said, I canât believe it.â Â  âBut you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now itâs in over 30 countries. And youâre going to stop them? I donât think so.â Â  âThat is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she â frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.â Â  âWell, I have much better judgment than she does. Thereâs no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?â Â  âI have a much better â she spent â let me tell you â she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising â you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names â oh, temperament, letâs go after â I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have aâ¦â Â  âWait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I donât know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, thereâs a person with a temperament thatâs got a problem.â Â  âWrongâ¦ Itâs liesâ¦Â That lineâs getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like toâ¦Â Itâs not an accurate one at all. Itâs not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things â and just to respond.â Â  âI agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your â your president thinks. Â Nuclear is the single greatest threat.â Â  âJust to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and weâre losing a fortune. Thatâs why weâre losing â weâre losing â we lose on everything. I say, who makes these â we lose on everything.â Â  âAll I said, that itâs very possible that if they donât pay a fair share, because this isnât 40 years ago where we could do what weâre doing. We canât defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million.â Â  âAll I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. Weâre a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out.â Â  âWell, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, sheâs very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their â they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.â Â  âWe are not â we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.â Â  âI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, itâs over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I canât take anything off the table.â Â  âBecause you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, weâre doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.â Â  âWhy didnât you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodyâs ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. Â So you say to yourself, why didnât they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.â Â  âAnd theyâre going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, heâs not a happy camper.â Â  âBut I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, itâs getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because theyâre in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.â Â  âAnd she doesnât say that, because sheâs got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesnât have that.â Â  âAll you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I donât believe that Hillary has the stamina.â Â  âThe world â let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but itâs bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last â so sheâs got experience, that I agree. Â But itâs bad, bad experience.â Â  âI never said thatâ¦ I didnât say thatâ¦ Where did you find this?â¦ Oh, really?â Â  âYou know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of itâs said in entertainment. Some of itâs said â somebody whoâs been very vicious to me, Rosie OâDonnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.â Â  âBut you want to know the truth? Â IÂ was going to say somethingâ¦Â extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, âI canât do it. I just canât do it. Itâs inappropriate. Itâs not nice.â Wow. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things Trump said that completely and utterly ridiculous. When it finally came time to face off with Hillary Clinton on the debate stage, Trump failed miserably and totally embarrassedÂ himself. As Hillary said Monday night, Donald âlives in his own reality,â presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense. ",0,1,0
917,"Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared on CNN’s pre-Presidential Debate coverage Monday afternoon, absurdly joking with Wolf Blitzer that the Republican Party’s presidential candidate was ready for the debates because “he’d already been through 14 season finales” of Trump’s reality TV show The Apprentice. Of course, it makes absolutely no sense to equate a gaudy half-hour of programming that loosely classifies as entertainment with what is arguably the hardest and most significant hurdle in the journey to becoming the most powerful elected official on the planet, but false-equivalency is after all, the biggest theme of this election. In his latest act “The Donald,” who is apparently “not a fan of mock debates” because “he can get bored,” has decided to eschew traditional methods of debate preparation, instead opting to watch footage of Mrs. Clinton’s best and worst debate moments to look for vulnerabilities. When asked about Trump’s preparation for the debates, Priebus didn’t appear to be concerned about how Trump would perform at the debates, “He’s very comfortable,” Priebus said. “He did a great job in our primary debates. He will be prepared. He’s always shown up for the big dance.” Although Blitzer attempted to press Priebus for more specific details on how Trump is preparing for the debate, the RNC chair would not budge, saying he “didn’t want to get into all those details,” and changing the conversation to discuss the Clinton campaign instead. The Trump-Clinton debate will be at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY Monday night at 9:00 PM EST and will be broadcast across all the major networks. It is expected to be the most viewed television debate of all time, and could reach up to 100 million viewers, almost certainly affecting the outcome of the November election. Donald Trump made a name for himself in the fact-free zones that were the Republican primary debates, where a group of neocons, corporate shills, and religious extremists argued over who was willing to murder more Middle Eastern people and who hated government the most. Trump thrived by being a bully, making fun of his opponents and literally talking about the size of his penis. He’s not going to be able to get away with that tonight.

817,"Watch this thug knock out two beefy girls in a restaurant (video below), then we’ll have a fun chat about it afterwards. Maybe some wine and frogs, but that’s none of my business. So the skinny guy in the wife-beater, how appropriate, was arguing with the two booger monster looking ladies who seem exactly like the type of gal a black man loves. You know, big ol hips, stanky tattoos, and lack of a father figure. They’re all going buck wild on each other and you know it’s only a matter of moments until someone gets triggered and ends up on WorldStar HipHop. Finally someone says something and it looks like some drink goes flying, glass shattering, fists flying boogaloo instead of people slurping down milkshakes and hamburgers. If Soul Train was a battle royal in a diner, then this would be it. If Ed Norton’s fight club was coed, then this would be it. I am Jack’s big booty ho getting beat up by a black man.  He knocks out one crumb-eating gal with a right hand, then I can’t even tell what happened to the other lady. I just see blond hair flying, red shirts ripping, flea-bag cheap tattoos exposed and I was legitimately hoping a breast didn’t come out as I laughed at this awful video. Normally I enjoy a fine chest peek during a chick fight, but I am not interested in women this size. Not my type. After several rounds of fists and kicks, the man has now assaulted two women. The girls are pretty ugly, but that doesn’t make it OK to strike a woman. If he were a real man, he would have walked out with his dignity instead of sucker-punching it into the large forehead of these women. Hillary Clinton calls Trump supporters deplorable, but she should probably show this video at her next rally if she’s not too sick to stand up and press play on the remote. If anything is deplorable, it’s this behavior and a man assaulting two women. Hopefully they’re ALL arrested. And if you missed it, there was a cameo by the chef and a deplorable butt crack by the lady in the red shirt. I don’t want my strawberry pancakes at the diner interrupted by nonsense like this. Do you?  If you really need to be disturbed. Then imagine what would happen if this guy showed up to the fight. What on God’s given Earth is this creature? Don’t worry, that’s a man. You can look at it and not feel like a fake transgender creep in the Target bathroom.  Weird. I know. ",0,0,1
839,"A devastating crime happened this weekend in Baltimore but it’s being totally ignored by the press and Black Lives Matter because the shooter was a criminal not a Police Officer. Outside some rowhouses about 8:30 p.m on Saturday a handful of people were shot. Investigators say the shooting was a premeditated act of revenge in response to a Labor Day weekend shooting in which a man was fatally shot and two women were wounded, one of them pregnant. Although the victims may have recognized the gunmen, authorities haven’t immediately been able to identify the suspects. Attackers had a shotgun and two handguns. One of the armed men emerged from an alley and the others ran down the street and opened fire just in front of the victims. The surprised victims were a 3-year-old girl, a woman and a half dozen men. While the the 3-year-old girl and her father were standing a slight distance away from the others and that the child was not an intended target but got hit anyway. By then, most signs of the attack had been cleared away. There was a bullet hole through the rear window of a car parked on the block. Neighbors sat quietly on their steps. Few wanted to talk about the attack. “They’re scared,” said a woman, who declined to be identified. “They ain’t talking too much.” So far there have been 240 killings in Baltimore and it appears to be from gang activity. On Sunday there were 4 other shootings and an 8-year-old boy was injured adding to the city’s mayhem. I guess the question is; where are the riots? Where are Black Lives Matter? Do they not really care about violence against minorities unless it’s from a Police Officer? Sadly, black on black crime is the biggest tragedy happening to minorities and yet Black lives Matter remains silent. Below are some statistic showing the hypocrisy of BLM: ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* And while black people continue to kill black people en masse, it’s harder to get killed by a police officer if you’re black than getting hit by lightening.

1220,"The window is rapidly closing for the White House to publicly hit back at Russia over a suspected Kremlin-backed cyber campaign to meddle in the U.S. election process, according to a vocal cadre of lawmakers who are hammering the Obama administration over its silence on the matter. The lack of any open retaliation, they say, is giving Russian hackers free rein to manipulate the election process in the final lap of the campaign season, sowing further doubts about an electoral system that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump frequently bashes as “rigged.” Story Continued Below “I’ve been very surprised the administration hasn’t done something about it,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I think it’s a very serious problem. This isn’t a small matter. It’s an historic matter. No one has ever been allowed to monkey around with our electoral system.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, lamented that the White House is tiptoeing around the hacks “because of this obsession they have with not offending Putin because of Syria and other things.” “If [Russia] did do it,” Graham added, “the Obama administration won’t do a damn thing about it.” Numerous former Obama administration officials acknowledge that the longer the White House waits to unveil any response, the more political scrutiny the move will receive, given Democrats’ allegations that the Kremlin is using its vast hacking apparatus to tilt the election in favor of Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. “It’s harder to do the closer we get to the election,” said Timothy Edgar, who served in the first Obama administration as the director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff. And some lawmakers and policy experts believe waiting until after Election Day to strike back publicly means missing a chance to stem the tide of digital assaults on election targets. “You can’t deter after the fact,” said Adam Segal, an international cyber policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. But officials are constrained by competing priorities that could take precedence over shaming Moscow for the hacks, which have compromised top Democratic political institutions as well as senior government officials on both sides of the aisle. Any response could put the final nail in the State Department’s already faltering efforts to negotiate a Syrian ceasefire agreement with Russia, spark a tit-for-tat cyber war between Washington and Moscow and potentially expose valuable espionage tactics at a time that the U.S. government is reportedly ramping up its digital snooping on Putin’s regime. And many on both sides of the aisle, as well as former officials, cautioned that moving swiftly on public finger wagging, economic sanctions or criminal indictments — the three most likely types of official responses — may have little actual deterrent effect before the election. “You know that countries conduct espionage on each other,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told POLITICO when asked if the White House needed to issue an overt response. “You understand that, right?” House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) believes such public responses can establish an impossible mandate to identify hackers after every major breach. “I think that’s the danger in all this,” he said. “If you start to name someone, well, you’re going to have no shortage of people to name, and in a lot of cases it’s not attributable.” The first of this summer’s election-themed cyber intrusions — at the Democratic National Committee — probably led to July’s mass leak of 20,000 internal emails that appeared to show the party’s favoritism for Clinton over her presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The message dump forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Later, hackers released the personal contact information of nearly every Democratic House member and staffer after another digital break-in at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Elsewhere, suspected Russian hackers have also targeted Clinton campaign staffers’ personal emails, left-leaning advocacy groups, Democratic state officials and potentially even voter registration databases. According to media reports and numerous former officials, the Obama administration is probably far along in its investigation into the attacks. U.S. intelligence officials already have “high confidence” that Moscow is involved in the spate of hacks, according to anonymous federal officials quoted in The New York Times. On Thursday, Feinstein and House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said they had heard enough in their briefings with officials to conclude that Russia is to blame. “We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,” the pair said in a joint statement. The remarks broke with other lawmakers — even those like Graham — who have cautioned against accusing Russia before authorities make an official determination. “I very much hope the president will respond,” Feinstein told POLITICO. “In my mind, there’s no question that the Russians have been poking around in our various systems.” Lawmakers across the political spectrum have echoed Feinstein’s call for a response — regardless of who is responsible. “We need to take action,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) told POLITICO. “It’s not just naming, it’s … using the tools we have available to make it clear we won’t accept that type of behavior.” But with little more than six weeks to go before Election Day, the administration's choices may be limited. Preparing criminal indictments for the hackers responsible can take months, even years. The DNC hack was revealed only in June, kicking off the slate of intrusions and leaks that are still ongoing. In the last few weeks alone, suspected Russian-linked hackers have posted personal information on Democratic donors, revealed internal House race strategy memos from the DCCC and leaked the personal emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and an apparent White House staffer. “If the process is governed by the criminal investigation, I don’t see that you’re going to have any response by the election,” said Michael Zweiback, a former chief of the cyber crimes section of the U.S. attorney’s office in California’s Central District. Conversely, the administration has previously shown it can swiftly prepare economic sanctions following major hacks. It only took five weeks for the White House to announce sanctions on North Korea in retaliation for the bruising hack that temporarily disabled Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014. Whether similar sanctions could have a tangible deterrence effect on Russian hacking is debatable, though, even if such a move would help establish international norms in the long run. Christopher Swift, a former official with the Treasury Department office that oversees hacking-related sanctions, cautioned that Russia’s economy has already had two years to adjust to the strict international penalties slapped on the country in response to its military action in Ukraine. Additional sanctions may not be “adequate” to alter Moscow’s immediate decision-making, he said. Russian state-backed hackers often don’t work for the Kremlin in an official capacity, making them even more insulated from sanctions, added Swift, now a national security professor at Georgetown University. Many on Capitol Hill have simply pressured the Obama administration to publicly blame Russia for the hacks if the investigation finds it culpable. “The deterrence aspect of cyber response is very, very important,” said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who chairs a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that oversees cyber threats, during a recent hearing. “Public responses make an impression, as well.” But cyber policy experts and former Justice Department and White House officials concede that any response before the election will have unpredictable ramifications on the presidential campaign trail, just as campaigns are entering the last leg of the race. “No matter what they do, people are going to try and politicize it,” said Chris Finan, former White House director of cybersecurity legislation and policy. “I don’t know that they can completely insulate themselves.” “Both candidates are going to be asked what their position is and what should be done about it,” said Ed McAndrew, a former DOJ national security cyber specialist. “I think that the response, unless it is a strong response, is going to create more potential issues than it’s going to solve, and that [is] certainly so for the candidates.” The White House is also boxed in by the shaky deal the State Department tried to reach with Russia to reduce violence in Syria. State is also working with Russia to enforce the wide-ranging, controversial agreement reached with Iran last year to reduce its nuclear capabilities. The State Department is one of several agencies — including the Justice Department, Defense Department and the National Security Agency — with a key voice at the table advising the White House on its response to the election hacks. Given the sensitive situation, some forces within State are probably more hesitant to prod Moscow over other issues at the moment, agreed former officials from multiple agencies who have been involved in similar deliberations. The State Department has as much ability to “throw up the red flag” as any other agency, said Edgar, the former White House cybersecurity official, who is now a visiting fellow with the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs at Brown University. Most cyber experts and lawmakers — even those who favor a public retaliation — accept that Russia would retaliate in-kind for any public move the White House makes. “You never know how they’re going to respond,” Cardin said. “One thing is that you can’t take them for their word.” Some suspect that a recent online dump of apparent classified NSA hacking tools was meant as a sly message from Moscow to Washington: We’ll reveal your espionage secrets if you mess with us. “We need to be prepared for the Russians’ public response,” said McAndrew, the former DOJ cyber specialist. “And it might be a tit-for-tat, it might be [Russia publicly revealing our operations].” But to those who favor public retaliation, the Obama administration can’t let these factors sway them from acting — and acting soon. “I think we still have some time,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who has called on the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on the issue. “If you have an opportunity to forestall further meddling by sending a deterrent signal and making the Russians feel some pain … I think the administration has an obligation to do that irrespective of politics,” Finan said.",1,0,0
15,"Ivanka Trump met privately with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, Monday in New York City, sources confirmed to ABC News. Trump, who requested the meeting, attended Ryan's speech at the Economic Club of New York before the two had a scheduled meeting.     Ryan shared some of his experiences from the 2012 presidential campaign trail and Trump provided Ryan with an update on her father's presidential campaign, according to a source. Ryan has not crossed paths with Trump or his family since the Republican National Convention. He has been running a parallel election-year campaign touting the House GOP ""Better Way"" policy agenda and raising money for Republicans in the House and Senate, setting fundraising records. Last week, he suggested Trump should release his tax returns. Ivanka Trump, who is one of her father's closest confidantes, has kept in touch with Hill Republicans throughout the presidential campaign on policy issues.

1362,"The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee now plans to spend at least $5 million in Indiana, a media-tracking source confirmed Tuesday, as Democrat Evan Bayh’s once-dominant lead over Republican Todd Young has narrowed rapidly in the race considered a key part of Democrats’ strategy to take the Senate majority. The Senate Democrats’ campaign arm initially planned to spend $2.5 million supporting Bayh in Indiana as part of their broader strategy to bolster spending in traditionally conservative-leaning states such as North Carolina. But the DSCC has since doubled their ad reservations in Indiana. Story Continued Below “We expanded the map this year into states like Indiana where we can pick up an open Republican-held seat and further put the GOP on defense as they struggle to keep their hold on their majority,” a Democratic official said. Meanwhile, Senate Majority PAC — the super PAC dedicated to electing Democrats to the Senate — is adding an additional $1 million to their initial spending, bring its total ad reservation to $1.7 million in Indiana, a spokesman said. Bayh, who announced in July that he would make a last-minute comeback bid, has led in the limited public polling so far. But Bayh began his run with internal polling that showed him leading Young by more than 20 points. The most recent poll in the race, conducted by WTHR/Howey Politics earlier this month, shows Bayh with a four-point lead over Young.",1,0,0
1127,"A decade ago, the U.S. Census counted 15 people living in Roanoke’s downtown. If the world knew anything about the city of 100,000 in southwest Virginia, it was likely because of the massive illuminated star beaming down from a nearby mountain, a sad reminder of a long-ago era when holiday shoppers, bearing paychecks from the railroad that dominated the local economy, thronged the downtown department stores. Story Continued Below Now Roanoke is back on the map, with people at home and away starting to talk about it in a way they haven’t since the 1880s, when the “Magic City” sprang up out of nearly nowhere around a new railway interchange like some Far West gold-mining town. The downtown has been revitalized and, for the first time in its history, has 2,000 people living in it, many of them getting to and from other parts of the city via a refurbished greenbelt. A highly competitive medical school and world-class, $77 million research institute with a top-notch neuroscience program have both sprung up near the hospital, and the institute is about to double its size. People from the outside world—attracted by the beauty of the surrounding Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains—are moving in, reversing a 30-year population decline. Schools are good, violent crime is at a half-century low, and a public broadband network just doubled Internet speeds. Passenger rail service to Washington’s Union Station is making its return, and a tourism industry is flourishing where none existed before. The latest bit of good news, Oregon-based Deschutes Brewery, the eighth-largest craft brewery in the country, announced in March that it had chosen Roanoke for the site of its $85 million East Coast hub, bringing an initial 108 jobs. “Up until 2005, it was always, ‘Woe is us, and it’s so bad, and there was this star, which was kind of an embarrassment,’” recalls Beth Doughty, executive director of the Roanoke Regional Partnership, which markets the region to potential investors. “Now there’s a groundswell of love for the place, of community pride. We’re celebrating that star.” How did a small city in a disadvantaged region four hours from a major metropolis—one that had seen its signature industries atrophy or depart, that lacked so much as a branch campus of a state university—transform itself from the forgotten stepsister of the Appalachians into a formidable rival to Asheville, North Carolina? The answer has lessons for small, out-of-the-way cities everywhere: Roanoke’s people did it largely by themselves, in small steps and with an eye to assets and alliances in the wider region around them. “At some point we realized that we may never have the white knight come in with a Volkswagen auto plant and give us a quick win,” says Lisa Garst, a former city councilor in neighboring Salem who now heads Livable Roanoke Valley, a nonprofit that aims to engage citizens, governments and businesses in a regional planning process. “We realized what’s going to happen is going to come from people who are already invested here, know the value of the area and can stick it out for a 20-, 30- or 40-year time frame.” And it all happened in what would seem the most unlikely of places: a city created, built and controlled for most of its history by the distant investors of that most controlling and rapacious of Industrial Age corporations, the railroad. *** Virginia may be the site of the first successful English colony and cradle of presidents, but Roanoke is an extremely young city. In 1881—when Philadelphia was about to celebrate its bicentennial and there were 61,000 people living in Richmond—what’s now downtown Roanoke was nothing but fields, cow pastures and marsh a mile and a half west of the village of Big Lick, population 650. In February of that year, E.W. Clark & Company of Philadelphia dispatched surveyors to Roanoke County to find the best spot to build a hub that would connect the two railroads it had acquired: the Shenandoah Valley Railroad (which was expanding north to south) and the Norfolk & Western (which ran east to west). Big Lick’s businessmen offered the company $10,000, a free acre of land and tax exemptions if it would build the hub in their hamlet. The company agreed, took the incentives, and, to the locals’ surprise, began construction of a brand new community not in their hamlet but a mile and a half to the east near the foot of Mill Mountain. They named it Roanoke (because “Big Lick” just wouldn’t do) and within weeks it dwarfed the older village and would soon spread west and absorb it. In a matter of months, Clark & Company’s subsidiaries laid out a new street grid on the banks of the rail line and constructed 128 houses, a depot, shops, iron works, railroad offices and the grand Hotel Roanoke, which has served as the city’s central landmark ever since. Demographers define “boomtowns” as having a 15 percent annual growth rate. In the first decade after the company’s arrival, Roanoke’s population increased an average of 290 percent a year and the city became Virginia’s third biggest after Richmond and Norfolk. The speed of the growth meant a certain lack of polish. The Hartford Courant’s correspondent found “streets of temporary wooden shops and dwellings, drinking shops and ‘hotels’ with false board fronts hiding the upper half stories and big letter signs after the manner of the West.” As in the instant cities of the Far West, there were drunken fights in the saloons and brothels, unpaved roads that turned to mud when it rained and reeking open sewers beside wood sidewalks. “The town,” the Baltimore Sun reported, “suggests a mining camp or a mushroom city of Colorado.” Roanoke’s ribald reputation chastened company officials, motivating their wives to organize civic improvement efforts in the first decade of the 20th century, culminating in their contracting celebrated landscape architect John Nolen to the city in 1907. Nolen, a student of Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., is generally credited with being the father of American city planning, and for Roanoke he created what was the nation’s first comprehensive city plan. Nolen, who had been raised in an orphanage and had a rather un-Victorian empathy for the poor, was appalled that the city had “no public gardens, parks, parkways, no playground, no attractive school yards, no monuments, no public library, no open plazas or public squares … and no public buildings of distinction.” He found the living conditions in the African-American neighborhood—home to a third of the population—completely unacceptable. His plan called for comprehensive investments throughout Roanoke, including a network of parks, a river walk along the Roanoke River, playgrounds in every ward, a grand city hall and library, and the purchase of Mill Mountain for the public, a resource he likened to Mount Royal in Montreal. The plan, he said, would turn Roanoke into the “most attractive city in the state if not the entire country.” But the city fathers didn’t like the idea of investing in black neighborhoods, and voters rejected even a scaled-down bond issue. Nolen’s plan was put on the shelf. Many of its recommendations would wait a century to be implemented. *** For the next half-century, Roanoke settled into a comfortable company-town pattern, with the Norfolk & Western dominating the civic scene and the regional economy through its ownership of 400,000 acres of Appalachian coal country. The railway built its own locomotives and rolling stock near the town center, underwrote the construction of a hospital at the foot of Mill Mountain and donated land for parks and churches. The city remained sharply segregated, with African-Americans maintaining their own commercial and entertainment district right into the 1960s, when much of it was demolished in the name of “urban renewal.” By then, Roanoke had begun to feel the same forces undermining cities across the country. Federally subsidized superhighways tore through neighborhoods and funneled people to new homes in far-flung suburbs. Department stores, shops, restaurants and hotels followed them, eroding the tax base and the vitality of downtown. “By the mid-1970s, downtown Roanoke was in sad shape,” says Dwayne Yancey, editorial page editor of the Roanoke Times. “The old farmer’s market in its heart was a bad place—hookers, transvestites, dealers, all manner of shady characters. Decent people didn’t go there.” Educator Anita Price, who is African-American, arrived around this time from Baltimore, following her husband back to his home city. “I was depressed for two years because I looked around and thought, ‘Oh, Lord, how am I going to give my children a good education, give them the cultural environment that we’re used to in this area that looks absolutely devoid of any amenities?’” recalls Price, who is now vice-mayor. “It was segregated, the downtown was lily-white, and I saw no minority professionals. These things really concerned me.” The city council, deadlocked by factional differences—partisan, racial and parochial—couldn’t take action. “They would argue with each other instead of doing strategic planning, like the federal Congress now,” says retired bank executive Warner Dalhouse, who rallied city luminaries to do something about it. “Downtown was becoming a ghost town, but we believed it was the beating heart of the whole Roanoke Valley, the city lights of the whole western part of the state.” In 1975, Dalhouse and his colleagues saw an opening: The city had annexed a large chunk of county territory and, in order to give the new residents fair representation, a judge had ordered the entire city council, mayor and vice-mayor to go up for reelection, all at once. “It looked to several of us like a historic opportunity because you could elect a new council and get diversity and business expertise and energy and progressive ideas and mutual agreement all at the same time,” Dalhouse says. They drafted a bipartisan dream team—including preacher Noel Taylor (who would later become one of the first African-American mayors elected in a predominantly white Southern city) and Nick Taubman, son of the founder of Advance Auto Parts—ran them as the “Roanoke Forward” party, and raised the then unheard-of sum of $90,000 to promote their candidacies. “It was a landslide,” Dalhouse recalls of the 1976 vote. “We elected all seven.” Roanoke has a strong city-manager form of government, and the dream team hired a young, energetic outsider for the position, Bern Ewert, who had to leave his previous gig in Stratford, Connecticut, after blowing the whistle on a bribery scheme. “In Roanoke, the charge from them to me was very broad: Integrate the city workforce, improve city relations, rebuild the neighborhoods and downtown, and lower taxes,” recalls Ewert, who was 35 when he arrived just after New Year’s in 1978. “And when you finished all that, come back and talk to us.” The fact that past bond issues to do such things had been shot down by voters didn’t make the task any easier. Nor did the local preference for demolishing historic buildings rather than renovating them, as Ewert proposed. But Ewert gathered up his courage and did what nobody had previously dared to do. He went to Jack Fishwick, president of the Norfolk & Western, a man who determined the fate of entire counties in the Kentucky and West Virginia coal country but didn’t participate in city politics because, as Ewert puts it “they were so powerful they were afraid they’d skew things. I was scared of him, like everyone else was.” But he made his pitch: To save downtown, they needed his support. Fishwick agreed and, like magic in the Magic City, winds began filling the reformer’s sails. The local CBS television affiliate agreed to give Ewert’s team two prime-time slots a week to present and solicit public ideas and preferences for the revitalization of downtown, an effort called Design 79. A local department store gave his staff a storefront where they collected thousands of ideas and suggestions from more spotlight-averse citizens. “The idea was to get as many citizens involved as we possibly could,” Dalhouse says. “By the time it got to a vote”—for the $15.5 million bond issue to move forward—“literally thousands were invested in it.” The resulting plan was modular, so it could be tackled piece by piece, and included revamping the historic city market building as a food emporium, adding benches, trees and awnings to the surrounding farmers market, expanding the library and a downtown park, building parking garages and connecting downtown and the Hotel Roanoke with a new pedestrian bridge over the busy rail corridor. The centerpiece was a rehabilitation of a large 1920s commercial building on Market Square to serve as the new rent-free home of several area museums and theaters. “We knew we needed a magnet—the equivalent of an anchor store at a shopping center—to attract people to the center,” Ewert recalls. The referendum passed on the first try, with a 55 percent majority. The joint museum space, Center on the Square, was an instant hit, with 40,000 visitors on its opening weekend in 1983. “That was a real red-letter date,” says Yancey of the Times. “It gave people a reason to go there; restaurants and businesses followed, and the trend line has just continued from there.” But just as downtown was flickering back to life as an entertainment district, the rest of the city was reeling from a body blow to its identity from which it took two decades to recover. *** The shocking announcement came on an early spring day in 1982. The Norfolk & Western, which had been based in the city since its foundation, was merging with a D.C.-based rival and moving its headquarters to Norfolk, 240 miles away. The new Norfolk Southern would shed 1,500 local jobs—a third of the total and including many clerical positions—beginning a long, slow retreat from the city it had built. “In those days, they didn’t give you three weeks of media chatter beforehand, they just made an announcement and boom!” says Doughty, who worked for a local public relations firm at the time. “We were pretty happy, content and self-satisfied being a railroad town, so that was quite a kick in the pants for the community and the region.” The blows kept coming. The railroad closed the Hotel Roanoke, now a Tudor-style, 382-room edifice and as much a symbol of the town as the Mill Mountain star, shutting off its fountains and dispatching liquidators to sell off its furnishings. “To see that place closed with a chain link around it was just more bad news,” says Ray Smoot, a veteran administrator at Virginia Tech, 35 miles to the west in Blacksburg. Not long thereafter, the railroad abandoned its grand headquarters building down the hill from the hotel. People looked to the local banking powerhouse, Dominion, to fill the void, only to have it absorbed by a Charlotte rival in 1992. “It really set up a decade of civic angst,” says Yancey. “If we’re not a railroad town and we’re not a banking town, what are we?” But the marginalization of traditional power had a silver lining, observes Ed Walker, a native son who was attending Washington & Lee University School of Law, an hour to the northeast, at the time. “Everybody used to pack up their briefcases and go to the railroad and the bank to see if they could build this museum or do x, y or z,” he says. “Now there was nowhere to go to anymore. The city had to look to itself. And that created a power vacuum that let some talented and interesting and unexpected change agents come forward and try things that never could have happened when I was growing up.” The first such agent was a very large one, Virginia Tech, a public research university in the next valley to the west that had never had much to do with Roanoke. “Virginia Tech did not at the time have a first-class hotel or conference center on its campus in Blacksburg,” says Smoot, then the CEO of the Virginia Tech Foundation, the university’s investment arm. “And there was the iconic Hotel Roanoke sitting there empty.” The railroad agreed to donate the hotel to the university foundation, which allied with city officials and local civic leaders to raise $28 million to completely rehabilitate the structure, while the city put up $14 million to build a conference center wing, which opened in 1995. “That’s the thing that began Virginia Tech’s relationship with Roanoke,” Smoot says. A decade later, that relationship would move into overdrive, transforming both parties. Other higher education institutions in the region—from Roanoke College in Salem to the Virginia Community College system—partnered with civic leaders and the state to turn the old Norfolk & Western headquarters building into a higher education center, where various institutions could offer classes, continuing education and workforce training. “We’re going to change this town from a blue-collar town into a university town,” retired Norfolk & Southern chief Fishwick proclaimed during this era. “I think it’s the greatest thing to happen in Roanoke in my lifetime.” The center enrolls 2,800 students at a time, and by 2010 was estimated to be boosting the local economy by $32 million. Meanwhile, a deteriorating sewer line winding along the overgrown and ignored banks of the Roanoke River was wearing out, requiring that the city establish a right of way to properly replace it. A local nonprofit, the Valley Beautiful Foundation, introduced city leaders to the greenway concept in John Nolen’s 1907 plan: a riverside park with walking or biking trails connecting the city’s districts. Slowly, starting in the late 1990s, a greenway expanded along the new sewer lines, eventually to extend into a 285-mile network crisscrossing the valley between the Appalachian Trail to the north and the Blue Ridge Parkway to the south. They were immediately popular. “We had problems with trying to keep people off the greenways until we finished constructing them,” recalls Darlene Burcham, who was city manager during much of the build-out. “People could live in one place and work in another and not have to get in their car.” *** As the greenways expanded, Walker, by then a young, third-generation attorney doing due diligence reviews for businesses, was getting frustrated with the creative and financial limits of his profession, which was not always in alignment with his desire to effect positive social change. He had helped open the Downtown Music Lab, a nonprofit providing at-risk teens a place to play and record music (musician Dave Matthews was among the donors), but it was a project assigned to him by Dalhouse, the retired bank executive, that showed him another path. “I had early on identified Walker as a talent and had decided to give him some nudging in one direction or another,” Dalhouse says. A historic movie palace in Roanoke’s declining Grandin Village neighborhood was up for sale, and local do-gooders needed help raising $1.6 million to buy and rehabilitate it as a community theater. His instincts about Walker were spot on. “I just had this epiphany about the incredible convening power of real estate,” recalls Walker, who was amazed by how quickly people and money rallied around the project. “Nothing moves faster than community-minded capital with investing in a community’s real estate. You can take the status quo and change it immediately.” Anchored by the theater, the Grandin neighborhood promptly bounced back and is now one of the city’s most desirable areas. So, in 2002, Walker quit the law and embarked on a series of profitable, but socially minded, redevelopments in the heart of the city, a place Design 79 had shored up as an entertainment and a shopping district but where a grand total of 15 people actually lived, most of them in apartments above their ground-floor place of business. The first was the stately 10-story Colonial American Bank building, which he and a partner purchased for $1.4 million in 2003 and renovated as upscale condos ranging in size from 3,000 to 4,800 square feet. Walker’s family moved into the top floor and his partner into another condo, and Dalhouse purchased a third (which he and his wife live in today), prompting other well-heeled buyers to follow suit. Walker then bought the former Grand Piano and Furniture Company block nearby and, with the help of historic tax credits and an $880,000, no-interest loan from the city housing authority, converted it into 58 mixed-income apartments. “Condos were one thing, but it was largely unknown how many people would pay rent to live down here,” Walker says. To his shock, the entire building was leased on opening day. “Everybody looked at each other and said, ‘What just happened?’” Since then, Walker has helped develop Kirk Avenue, which runs behind the City Market area, as a restaurant and arts corridor, including a music hall that offers traveling bands free loft accommodations upstairs; transformed the decaying Patrick Henry Hotel into a mixed commercial and residential space with 134 apartments and a restored ballroom; and purchased a beloved local radio station to prevent it from abandoning its funky indie-folk-country format. He’s also donated a park and playground in Grandin Village, and developed inexpensive condos in a former Cotton Mill in another part of the city and a large riverfront property that now houses an enormous rock climbing gym. Combined, his projects to date run to some $70 million and 600,000 square feet. He founded an annual conference—CityWorks (X)po—that draws 350 experts to Roanoke to discuss “big ideas for small cities.” “Ed’s a very unusual developer in that he didn’t want to make a lot of money and run, but was more interested in the long-term benefit to the community,” says Burcham, the former city manager. “He realized we needed various income levels of housing, and he did that.” By the late aughts, downtown was taking on a 24/7 vibe, with more shops, businesses and eateries moving in to cater to residents, who numbered in the hundreds and total more than 2,000 today. A local art museum, having outgrown Center on the Square as the result of a large bequest, raised $66 million to build the new, 85,000-square-foot Taubman Museum of Art two blocks away, which opened in 2008. Even with the Great Recession that kicked off later that year, the city moved forward with step-by-step investments: two new high schools, an award-winning renovation of the main library, the revamping of a downtown park and amphitheater (which reopened with a concert by Sheryl Crow), and the continued expansion of trails and bike paths. “Hail Mary passes—going after The One Big Thing—often fail,” says Chris Morrill, a past president of the Government Finance Officers Association, who has been city manager since 2010. “You go for rapid incrementalism. You figure out where you want to go and you just keep moving: market building, new park, greenways, plaza, reopening the formal entrance of City Hall. You keep the momentum going and eventually all the naysayers say, ‘How did we get here?’” Beth Doughty of the Regional Partnership agrees. “People want economic development to be a silver bullet, but it’s not. It’s like spinning plates,” she says. “No one person or entity is responsible for all of the plates, but you do want them all spinning at the same time.” But Roanoke still had a problem: What did it want to be? *** Despite the progress, the city remained in an identity crisis through the 1990s and well into the aughts, disheartened that it had been left behind by upland Southern rivals such as Asheville and Charlotte. “I was asked from the day I arrived, ‘What is your vision of the city?’” says Burcham, who was city manager from 2000 to early 2010. “I said it’s not my vision, it’s the community’s vision, but everybody needs to get away from the idea that the goal was to be Charlotte, that if we didn’t get a particular airline coming here we were doomed.” Meanwhile, the board of the Roanoke Regional Partnership—a joint venture of regional city and county governments that spent much of its time trying to lure northeastern manufacturers to the region—decided it wanted to also focus on improving the area’s competitiveness. “Talent is the currency of the 21st century, and we needed to be more concerned about attracting it,” says Doughty, who left her position as head of the regional chamber of commerce in 2008 to take on the task. Essential to that was finding a new narrative the community could embrace, she says, and it became clear to her what it was. “If you asked people what’s the best thing about Roanoke, they would say, ‘The mountains, they’re so beautiful,’” she says. “But they talked about them like they were wallpaper. If we could embrace the idea we were an outdoors city, we could monetize the outdoors and really strengthen the region’s real advantage, its livability.” The Partnership hired a full-time outdoor branding guru, Pete Eshelman, who set about building partnerships with governments, businesses, nonprofits, and state and federal park authorities to extend trails, reopen whitewater rafting destinations, improve fishing and launch America’s Toughest Marathon, an annual event so-called because running it involves a 7,400-foot ascent. He’s helped organize professional road-cycling events, get a top BMX rider to develop a plan for an action sports park and raise money to build new canoe ramps and kayak park on the river. “This could only work if we had buy-in from the community, so it had to be real and true,” Eshelman says. “Now when they travel somewhere and talk with people about what Roanoke is like, an outdoor narrative is going to be part of the description, and that wasn’t the case before.” Simultaneously, the region’s visitor promotion agency, which previously focused on getting conventions to come to town, began marketing the area as “Virginia’s Blue Ridge,” a place of scenic beauty and outdoor adventure with a happening city in the middle. As a result, over the past five years travel spending has grown by more than a fifth, and hotel revenue by 25 percent. More visitors are coming—creating 600 more jobs—but the real goal of the effort is to get some of them to decide to come back and put down roots. “This is more than just tourism; this is workforce development, because we’re competing for world talent,” says Landon Howard, the agency’s president. A good thing, too, because suddenly Roanoke needed to recruit a lot of very talented people very quickly to partake in the most consequential undertaking since E.W. Clark & Company showed up back during Chester Arthur’s presidential administration. *** There’s been a hospital at the foot of Mill Mountain since 1900, when railroad officials decided they needed a place for injured workers to be treated. The current incarnation, Roanoke Memorial, was by the early 21st century the flagship of a sprawling nonprofit hospital network, a fleet of air ambulances and the only Level I trauma center in the western half of the state. The network, Carilion, was financially sound, but changes in how health care providers are reimbursed required that it shift its focus from managing hospitals to improving health outcomes across the surrounding communities, a clinic model that required a hiring bonanza, including a quadrupling of its physician staff. But how to recruit and retain so many highly skilled people to come to the mountains of southwestern Virginia? An essential component would be to open a medical school in Roanoke, an attractive feature for many of medicine’s best and brightest, recalls Nancy Agee, then Carilion’s chief operations officer and now its CEO. “It creates a different vibe and helps satisfy the sense of curiosity that many of the best and brightest physicians have,” she says. “We could do it ourselves, but wouldn’t it make more sense to find a partner?” By good fortune, a partner was close at hand. Down at Virginia Tech, President Charles Steger had challenged his institution to grow from a lower-50-ranked research university to one of the top 30 by 2013, a move that would require moving into fields funded by the National Institutes of Health. “We didn’t have a human medicine school, but we did have a lot of experience with technology transfer and research-related entrepreneurship,” says Smoot, the Virginia Tech administrator. “So a conversation began with Carilion.” The result was two joint ventures to be built in 2010 on what had been an old industrial site on the way from the hospital to downtown Roanoke: an elite, research-intensive medical school and a biomedical research institute with world-class aspirations. They approached Michael Friedlander, then chair of the neuroscience department at one of the nation’s leading and largest medical research institutions, the Baylor College of Medicine at Houston’s Texas Medical Center, to head the institute. “I only knew where Roanoke was because for some reason it was the place the Weather Channel gave for the region’s temperatures,” he says. “But they said you are going to get to build from scratch an innovative biomedical research enterprise and you can pretty much build it around your vision. And of course, you don’t often get offered stuff like that. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Friedlander took the job but knew the greatest challenge would be attracting top people from established institutions like Texas Medical Center, which had more employees (105,000) than Roanoke had people. “I had been struck by the natural beauty of the place and by the people’s pride in it and wanting to make it work,” he says. “Most academic medical centers in the U.S. are in not-so-great parts of major cities. Here we’re right next to a major health center with one of the top 12 busiest emergency departments in the country and you can go out at lunch time and be pulling trout out of the Roanoke River in hip waders.” If he could get people to visit, Friedlander thought, he would have a shot. His fishing expedition worked. Today, the Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute has some of the top researchers in neuroscience working on everything from the decision-making patterns of drug addicts to the use of brain imaging in psychiatry. It will break ground soon on a $66 million expansion that will double the number of research teams to 50. The medical school next door is also research intensive, with the unusual requirement that students undertake a research project of publishable quality. Although the institution is only six yers old, this year it had 4,600 applications for 42 spots. Commercial research spinoffs are beginning to populate the downtown side of the complex, an area being promoted as the Innovation Corridor. “We’ve gone from a train city to a brain city,” says Mayor Sherman Lea, who, like the vice-mayor, circuit court clerk, school board chair and other city-wide elected officials, is African-American. (“When you have a city with less than 30 percent African-Americans in the mountains next to Tennessee, you wouldn’t think that. But that’s how we’ve changed,” he says of the electorate’s choices.) And soon it will be a beer city as well, having lured Deschutes here instead of long-envied Asheville and 48 other cities the brewery considered up and down the East Coast. Deschutes chief financial officer Peter Skrbek says he was drawn by logistics and clean water, the strong public schools and an outdoorsy culture akin to the company’s home in Bend, Oregon. “But the biggest thing was just being wanted by the community and their enthusiasm for us to come there each time we would visit,” he says. “I’ve never seen such enthusiasm for a company’s investment.” When the Deschutes news broke, one industry publication declared Roanoke the new Asheville. Over at the Roanoke Times, Yancey’s editorial responded: “We’d gently beg to differ,” he wrote. “We’re the new Roanoke.”",1,0,0
1594,"After Colin Kaepernick knelt during the National Anthem before a football game, he became a nationally recognized name. Some people decided to burn his jersey for disrespecting our nation and some held him up as a hero of the First Amendment. And there is the owner of Krossroads Rock and Country Bar in Virginia Beach, Virginia who saw the act as disrespectful and decided to make a statement of his own. He used a Kaepernick jersey as a doormat and posted a sign on the door reminding patrons to “wipe their feet.”  One patron, James Perry, not only viewed this as inappropriate but also, wait for it, racist. The Facebook post he made is below, but he does use some foul language, so watch out for that.   The business owner said what the rest of us already know, that this was about him disrespecting our flag, not race. Just because he’s half-black doesn’t make this racist. These people are using words they don’t even understand to try to shut down free speech because they don’t like it. Perry cries about how Kaepernick was just using his First Amendment right to express his opinion, but the reality is that this bar is just doing the same thing. One of his friends mentioned that they had plans to steal the jersey from the front of the bar and another insinuated that they would give it up because they’re afraid of riots. (Because that’s a good reason to riot, you buncha’ buffoons.)  Unfortunately for these morons, that would be considered theft of private property and they could end up in prison. But something tells me that wouldn’t bother them. ",0,0,1
639,"As news of more frequent police shootings appear in the media. People are asking why is this happening more now than before. Many theories have been proposed.   More crime… more drug use.. and so on.  There is one that has not been mentioned unitl now.  You heard it here first. When did the police shootings begin to increase? Was it in the 2000s..?  the teens? Or the 1960s..70s .. 80s or 1990s…?  Even during the riotous years of the sixtys  there were not as many LEO ..law enforcement officer ..shootings. I  recall many years when officers said they had gone an entire career without firing their weapon on duty.   A cursory search seems to indicate these shootings began more often from about the late 1980s on to present. That was about the same time  an officer Dennis Tueller in Salt Lake City introduced his study on timing of attacks.  This has become widely known among LEO  departments all across the country as The Tueller Drill. This same drill is also trained in concealed carry classes. How long does it take an attacker to get to you from a standing position? Think about that for a moment, imagine a BG bad guy standing twenty one feet from you. He has a knife or a bat.  How long do you think it would take?   Tueller found that from about twenty one feet.. it takes an attacker about two seconds, or less to get to you.  Two  seconds. So  beginning in the 1980s  LEO depeartments begain to train officers in the Tueller Drill.   Bad Guy. Knife. Twenty one feet.  No warning signal. You act when he moves toward you. Draw and fire. Now you can see what I believe is one of  the arguably biggest reasons for many of the now familiar shootings.  This is not to condemn the Tueller drill or LEOs for using it.  It is well founded an well  reasoned.    This is simply to inform why its happening .  If anything the burden is on the guy standing in front  of an officer.  Don’t charge an officer.  You will regret it.   ",0,0,1

CNN host Chris Cuomo – the New York Governor’s little brother – got into a tense exchange with one of Donald Trump’s advisers Boris Epshteyn. Cuomo argued that Trump should come clean with the birther issue, just as Hillary Clinton owned up to her private server issue. “With Hillary Clinton, she had to own the server thing,” Cuomo said. “It was wrong. We heard from all the people around her that it was wrong, she shouldn’t have done it, it was poorly thought out. It wasn’t enough. Why?” Epshteyn responded that they’re not the same thing. “And Hillary Clinton — there’s no equivalency. Hillary Clinton did something illegal. She broke the law.” They continued: Chris Cuomo: She did not do anything illegal. Boris Epshteyn: Yes, she did. Cuomo: James Comey’s a liar, too? Epshteyn: He said she shouldn’t be prosecuted. He did say she acted carelessly, and as a lawyer, if you look at all the particulars of bringing that case, there was a case to bring. And he said so, too. Cuomo: No, he didn’t. He said there’s no case that could be brought, there’s nothing prosecutable about it. He just said it in his report. He said it wasn’t a close call. Never mind the fact that even the FBI Director himself stated that it is a “felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.” Isn’t that exactly what Hillary Clinton did? Comey even said that she was “extremely careless” – in other words, grossly negligent – in her handling of classified information. And everyone knows that she had some 13 different mobile devices in addition to her private home server, which had on it classified information.

1381,"Saturday night, an Islamic immigrant went on a stabbing spree at a Minnesota mall, injuring nine people. He was heard invoking the name of “Allah” and asking people if they were Muslim before he stabbed them. But the terrorist was brought down by an off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer, who shot him as the terrorist tried to attack him. Falconer is a former police chief of the Albany Police Department, where he still works part-time. But what the media won’t tell you is that he is much more than just a police officer. Falconer is the owner and president of Tactical Advantage, LLC, a shooting range and training facility that focuses on training and arming concealed carriers. Falconer is also a member of the United States Practical Shooters Association (USPSA) and is an NRA-certified firearms instructor.   Of course, why would the media point out that being proficient in firearms is a good thing? It doesn’t fit in with their gun control narrative. And this is someone who isn’t just a police officer using his department-issued firearm to stop a terrorist; it’s a firearms instructor who has a passion for training people and promoting concealed carry. It’s like a liberal nightmare.   More and more Americans are choosing to get concealed carry permits, despite the liberal push for more gun control. Yet Jason Falconer is a perfect example of why owning guns is so necessary. We live in a dangerous world, with religious fanatics intent on murdering as many of us as possible. Liberals would have you cower in fear with no way to defend yourself. People like Jason Falconer want to help teach you to defend yourself. Is there really any question as to which is better? ",0,0,1

1447,"Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”. Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”   So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said. Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.   How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right? Obama has an agenda to push. ",0,0,1
973,"Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on China, Mexico and other countries to force them to negotiate better deals with the United States “could unleash a trade war that would plunge the U.S. economy into recession and cost more than 4 million private sector jobs,” says a new study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The nonpartisan think tank, which leans pro-free trade, outlines several scenarios that could result from the Republican nominee's plans to raise tariffs and withdraw from trade deals, including the sweeping Asia-Pacific pact that the Obama administration wrapped up last year. Its conclusion: Trump’s assault on NAFTA, China, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade deals would harm average American households, worsen income stagnation, devastate businesses and erode national security — and he would have the statutory authority to do it. Story Continued Below ""If implemented, these proposals would provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, unleashing a trade war that would send the U.S. economy into recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs,"" the study says. Trump’s top trade advisers dismissed the study as biased Monday, saying it comes from a corporate-funded think tank and “signifies nothing.” “They are the pimps of globalization for the corporate interests who have sent American jobs overseas and basically turned America into a stagnant economy,” said Peter Navarro, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine who has helped Trump develop his trade policies. Nearly half of the Institute’s revenue comes from major export-oriented corporations like Caterpillar, Pepsi and United Technologies, according to its website. The study comes as Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton rail against past trade policies for inflicting job losses and economic pain among working-class voters. President Barack Obama, who is pressing Congress to ratify the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership before he leaves office, has pushed back against both candidates’ trade stances. While the Peterson Institute also faults Clinton’s proposals, which call mainly for tougher enforcement, as leading to “stasis” in the expansion of trade, it reserves the bulk of its criticism for Trump. His policies “are another matter altogether” and could have disastrous consequences for the economy and for national security, the study says. Its projections are built on an earlier Moody’s Analytics study that estimated the economic effects of Trump’s call for steep tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports and the renegotiation of trade deals like NAFTA. Under the worst-case scenario, U.S. employment could drop by nearly 5 million jobs in 2019, with states like Washington, California, Massachusetts and Michigan suffering losses of nearly 5 percent of private-sector jobs, the think tank says. “Even if the statements are strategic, acting on them can, intentionally or not, produce escalating cycles of retaliation by trading partners,” the Peterson Institute says. “When planning a war, it is not advisable to assume that one’s adversary will surrender when the first shot is fired. For these reasons, Trump must be taken at his word.” But Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, says his Trump’s threat of tariffs is not an endgame but “simply part of an overall negotiating tool which is designed to get better and fairer deals.” Another Trump adviser, Nucor steel company CEO Dan DiMicco, quipped that the study is designed to scare voters and “should have come out on Halloween.” But DiMicco said Trump’s threats are ""very real, and our trading partners who are cheating should take it very seriously."" Unchecked government subsidies and currency manipulation are just some of the ways other countries are gaining an unfair trade advantage, he said. Trump could execute his stated plans to stop countries like China from “cheating” through executive powers that allow the president to raise tariffs unilaterally, the study finds. The nominee even went so far as to lay out the statutes he would invoke to retaliate against China’s “illegal activities” in a June 28 speech. Many of the authorities allow the president to hike tariffs or restrict imports in other ways based on broad interpretations of national security. U.S. companies couldn’t count on lawmakers or the courts to act fast enough to head off any initial economic shocks caused by Trump’s policies, the Peterson study says. “At least for a few years, a President Trump would have the stronger legal hand and his actions would very likely survive challenges in the U.S. courts and Congress,” it says. Legal action challenging the statutory authority could take months or even years, and any efforts by major U.S. importers like Apple to seek rapid relief through preliminary injunctions to stop Customs and Border Protection from collecting those duties would face legal uncertainty, the authors write. Even if Trump threatened high tariffs only as a tactical maneuver, “foreign countries will soon retaliate,” they say. Countries ""will not patiently wait for U.S court proceedings or litigation in the WTO to vindicate their claimed rights under international law — specifically the right to export to the U.S. market at low [bound] tariffs, or duty free,” the authors say. “Enormous economic damage to U.S. firms, workers and communities could ensue from a trade war long before the legal battlefield is cleared.""",1,0,0
334,"(CNN)Even though Donald Trump has said he does not exercise, his supporters can still break a sweat in campaign style. The Republican presidential nominee's campaign is offering a ""Make America Great Again"" sweatband in exchange for a campaign donation.

1254,"I’ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I’m pretty much baffled. The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton’s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses—especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: “You’ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you’re one of those who’s created the mess we’re in.” So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising. Story Continued Below Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I’ve called “political judo”—turning an opponent’s strength against her. (“Yes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that’s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy’s chief speechwriter, are backing me.”) Further, there's a sense—a highly limited sense—in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, “I'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.” It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was). By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of “honest and trustworthy”? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers—assuming they exist—to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump—bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post—but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump—and he's still standing. Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don’t do, based on a half-century or so of history. The Focus Is on “Moments”—But They’re Not Always The Key Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this: “Nixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ‘there you go again,’ then asked Americans ‘are you better off?’ Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale’s ‘youth and inexperience.’ Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife’s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.” These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It’s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines—“zingers”—to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It’s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, “You’ve all become theater critics.”) But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it’s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the ”aha!” moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama’s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president’s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten. The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a “moment” unlike any in debate history; that’s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: “he seemed pretty reasonable” or “she knows what she’s talking about and he doesn’t.” This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable. There Are Three Debates, Not One—And That Can Matter A Whole Lot One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th—barely a week before the election. Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That’s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it’s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings. Here, I think, is an opening for Clinton—especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question—and they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questions—into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump’s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush’s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argue—from experience—that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format—with dozens of “real” people as participants—makes the resort to personal insults highly risky). Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience. “Well,” he said, “they've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.” Judo, however, can cut both ways. There’s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success. “Well, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don’t know because you’re the first presidential candidate ever who won’t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn’t start with millions from his father, says you’re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit—you’re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.” Debates Are NOT Decisive One last note. It’s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (“Reagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.” “Obama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected…”). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama’s clear if modest popular vote victory. In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other “game-changers” with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney’s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the “fundamentals”—economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate—the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance. Of course, this cycle the “fundamentals” point to a very close race. So you’ll probably want to tune in anyway",1,0,0

Talk about bad news getting worse. Brazile thought she was giving Clinton a compliment, but she slipped up and essentially made things worse for Clinton by admitting the former first lady had to be lifted into the van. The question that will be on the minds of many people is exactly when Hillary got up on her own and what was needed for her to do so. While Clinton has admitted to being diagnosed with pneumonia, that doesn’t get rid of her other chronic condition — lying to the public. She said she didn’t tell the public about her diagnosis because she didn’t think it was a big deal, but if she pays just a little bit of attention to the news, she would have known the her health is a huge concern — one she should not be ignoring.

A whopping 95 percent of all campaign television ad spending scheduled between today and Election Day — more than $143 million worth — comes from Clinton’s team, according to an ABC News analysis of CMAG/Kantar Media data. Team Clinton will spend $143.2 million on television ads, versus only $6.8 million for Team Trump. The difference in future spending in key battleground states is even starker — with Team Clinton slated to spend 53 times as much as Team Trump on television ads in Florida between now and Nov. 8. In Florida, Clinton is spending $36.6 million, versus just under $700,000 for Trump. The differences continue in Ohio ($20.9 million versus $1.8 million), Pennsylvania ($18.8 million versus $1.5 million) and North Carolina ($14.3 million versus $1.3 million.) Those are crucial states for Trump’s campaign. If he wins all four, he will almost certainly land in the White House. If he loses even one, it will be very difficult for Clinton to lose the general election. Recent polling in these states has shown a tight matchup but a lead for Clinton in Pennsylvania. While ads for the campaigns are guaranteed to be at lower prices during these final 60 days, outside groups can get charged steep prices. That’s why it’s important that Priorities USA Action has already scheduled so many ads: It will be paying less than Trump’s outside groups — like the NRA and his super PACs — will be paying if they try to schedule ads now. Clinton’s campaign is footing the bill for slightly more than half her scheduled television advertising, while Trump’s campaign is slated for about $4 in $10. Clinton’s behemoth super PAC accounts for virtually all the rest of pro-Clinton spending, and Trump’s spending is splintered among the NRA and two other super PACs. Team Clinton has already spent $174 million on television ads during the general election, versus a mere $40 million for Trump and his allies. The contrast is also stark when comparing only the campaigns: $110.7 million for Clinton versus $18.7 million for Trump. Team Clinton Future Ads Florida: $36.6 million Ohio: $20.9 million Pennsylvania: $18.8 million North Carolina: $14.3 million Nevada: $10.1 million New Hampshire: $7.3 million Iowa: $7.1 million Colorado: $5.8 million Virginia: $0.5 million Nebraska: $0.2 million National: $21.6 million Total: $143.2 million Team Trump Future Ads Ohio: $1.8 million Pennsylvania: $1.5 million North Carolina: $1.3 million Florida: $0.7 million Colorado: $0.3 million Iowa: $0.2 million New Hampshire: $0.1 million Maine: $0.1 million National: $0.6 million Total: $6.8 million",1,0,0

According to veterinary charity, the PDSA, owners should stop giving their dogs bones as they assert that bones may actually be killing dogs!   The organization says that splintered bones could be damaging the digestive system of dogs and that many dogs have had to undergo surgery to repair the damage or address blockages caused by the bones. They said that cooked bones pose the greatest risk of splintering, but that raw bones pose dangers as well. Rebecca Ashman, a senior vet with the PDSA, said: “Surgery is usually needed to remove any blockage and in some cases, the damage is so serious that it can be fatal. Similarly, if they swallow a large piece of rawhide chew this can become stuck and cause serious problems.” We all love to see our pets happy, but it may be time to find new toys for the pooches to chew on. A wagging tail is nice, but being sliced up or blocked by bits of bone seems like a particularly nasty ordeal. What do you think? Wil you heed the advice? Or is the concern overblown? ",0,0,1
809,"Let’s just put it this way: If Donald Trump’s campaign was found guilty of this crime, the media would pre-emptively announce his resignation and carry him out of town, pitchforks and torches in hand. However, Hillary Clinton is apparently immune to any criticism in the media. Don’t know what I’m talking about? Let me fill you in. The campaign Hillary4America, a group that advocates for the policies of Hillary Clinton, was searching for recruits to go to the polls and preach the word of Clinton. Two things are wrong with this: First, it’s illegal to go to a polling/voter registration place and tell people who to vote for. It’s the reason why candidates can’t go to a polling/voter registration place and talk with voters, despite Bill Clinton doing it anyway and the media staying quiet about it. This seems like a clear cut case of voter manipulation and fraud. Second, the idiots behind Hillary4America didn’t know that one of their prospective recruits, the very people they were instructing to violate voter laws, had a hidden camera on the whole time and exposed them for the crooks they really are. Here is the entire thing, caught on tape. If this doesn’t clue you in into the mindset of people voting for Hillary, I don’t know what will.

972,"A federal judge lashed out at the State Department on Monday over what he charged was foot-dragging over Freedom of Information Act requests relating to Hillary Clinton's service as secretary of state. “You have a client that, to say the least, is not impressing the judges on this court, myself included. … It is in your client’s interest to start being more obviously cooperative,” U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon warned Justice Department lawyers representing State during a hearing Monday. “The State Department is at risk of being perceived as obstreperous. [They] need to get with the program.” The 10-minute hearing took place on a suit for records on how — and whether — Clinton and her aides were trained to handle classified information. State had proposed a deadline of Oct. 17 to produce about 450 unclassified documents relating to the training issue sought by the Daily Caller News Foundation. However, Leon ordered the diplomatic agency to complete processing and disclosure of those records by Oct. 10. He also said State must produce the records in three installments “of comparable size” and can’t leave the bulk of the records to the last batch. “We will do our best,” Justice Department attorney Jason Lee told Leon. “Do better than your best. … You do it,” Leon shot back. The issue of classified-information training for Clinton and her aides has drawn attention in recent weeks, after FBI Director James Comey observed that three emails received by Clinton had paragraphs marked with a (C) for information classified as “confidential,” although the entire messages were not properly marked as classified and appeared to have involved a cut-and-paste job. Comey also said that any senior official should have realized the topics being discussed in other emails were not suitable for an unclassified system. According to an FBI report, Clinton said she could not recall receiving any training or briefing on how to handle classified information. However, when the extent of her use of a private email account as secretary was revealed last year, Clinton said: “I’m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements.” An initial search for records responsive to the Daily Caller request turned up no records at all about training for Clinton or deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, while some were located for chief of staff Cheryl Mills and Director of Policy Planning Jake Sullivan. However, a lawyer representing the Daily Caller, Brad Moss, asked State to do a more thorough search. That turned up over 1,000 records last week, the bulk of them classified files about the process State uses to approve access to a highly classified program and to withdraw it when it is no longer necessary or a person leaves government. In an interview broadcast Monday on NPR, former President Bill Clinton said he trusted the State Department to make sure there was no conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Lee said many of those records are classified “Top Secret or higher than Top Secret.” That complicates the processing because people have to be granted the proper clearances, he said. He offered no estimate when those records will be processed, although most of them are expected to be withheld as classified. Leon also made clear that he believes the case should be prioritized because of the looming presidential election. “It’s time sensitive because it involves a national election for president,” the judge said. Moss had objected to State’s plan to finish production of the roughly 450 documents by Oct. 17, because that is only two days before the final presidential debate. The judge appeared to agree, saying the Daily Caller should have “time to go through them … for whatever newsworthy value they believe they have.” State has been swamped with dozens of lawsuits seeking emails sent or received by Clinton during her four years as secretary, as well as emails of her top aides and records on various other topics related to Clinton’s tenure. As the election draws nigh, State has faced demands from many quarters to get particular records out prior to the election. However, Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, didn’t seem interested in hearing much about that Monday. Instead, he noted that no lawyer from State was present at Monday’s hearing. “Impress upon them this way of doing business needs to stop,” the judge told Lee. “They’re not feeling the heat.” The verbal fusillade prompted Lee to step forward with further explanation, but he only managed to utter the words, “Your honor …” before the judge stood and walked off the bench. “We’ll issue an order,” Leon declared, passing up whatever Lee had planned to say and brusquely leaving the courtroom. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau declined to comment on the case that was in court Monday but sent POLITICO a statement defending her agency's broader transparency efforts. ""The Department strongly believes the Freedom of Information Act is a critical part of maintaining transparency to the public. Generally speaking, there has been a significant surge in FOIA requests to the State Department in recent years and we are working diligently to respond,"" Trudeau wrote. ""The volume of FOIA requests received by the Department has increased 300% since 2008 (6,000 requests per year to over 20,000 per year). In fiscal year 2015 alone we received approximately 22,000 FOIA requests."" Trudeau also said efforts are underway to improve State's responsiveness to public records requests. ""We are taking steps to improve our FOIA process — including conducting FOIA training sessions for staff and working to implement new technologies and best practices. Last year, Secretary Kerry appointed Ambassador Janice Jacobs as Transparency Coordinator to help address records management challenges across the Department,"" the spokeswoman said.

397,"Washington (CNN)Sen. Joe Manchin strongly defended his daughter, Heather Bresch, over growing criticism that her company dramatically raised prices for its life-saving medicine in order to enrich her company -- and herself. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the West Virginia Democrat broke his silence and sharply criticized lawmakers from both parties who have seized on the rising cost of EpiPen to bash his daughter's stewardship of her company, Mylan. He said lawmakers were trying to be ""sensational"" by seizing on Bresch's multi-million-dollar compensation. And he slammed an article in USA Today for questioning whether his wife, Gayle, improperly used her position in an education group to boost the drug's prices, calling it a ""cheap shot"" and ""tabloid"" journalism. He praised Mylan as a West Virginia company that saved the country $180 billion. Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen, which is one of the company's signature products. The drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600. The move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. One of those parents was actually a colleague of Manchin -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- and multiple members of Congress called for hearings on the spiking cost. Above all else, Manchin said it was unfair to blame Mylan for the dramatic increase in EpiPen, saying it was a problem in a ""convoluted"" system and middlemen that helped raise the price. ""Heather is the most caring, sharing, generous person I've ever met in my entire life - most accomplished and tougher than nails,"" he said. ""Absolutely,"" Manchin said when asked if his daughter was forthright to House lawmakers during a contentious hearing Wednesday. ""But people have to listen, too."" He added: ""We can criticize and beat the living crap out of anyone we want to, and that was proven yesterday. But does that solve the problem? Do they really want to solve the problem?"" Bresch earned nearly $19 million last year. Manchin suggested that the attacks on his daughter's compensation, which he called ""pretty sensational,"" were to be expected given her success. ""You have to expect that, you know,"" he said. ""I make $174,000. They haven't attacked me yet, but I'm sure that people who make less than 174 would attack us, too."" Asked if his daughter performed well, Manchin said that while anyone can always improve, she succeeded given the circumstances. ""That's a hostile environment,"" he said. ""Do they really want to fix a problem or do they want to make a statement for the next campaign?"" CNN's David Wright contributed reporting.",1,0,0
402,"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN)Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told a church group here Thursday that there is ""far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement"" during a conversation about faith. Pence was answering a question posed by Bishop John Brannon who asked about how Pence as vice president could personally unite the nation. Pence referenced recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, saying, ""It's a very troubling time for us."" The Charlotte shootings, which led to violence and unrest in that city this week, have sparked discussions of lethal police force against African-Americans. Pence mentioned faith as his first means to reunite the country and reduce violence, but then said he thought there was too much talk of how law enforcement officers conduct themselves. ""Donald Trump and I believe there's been far too much of this talk of institutional bias or racism within law enforcement. That police officers are human beings. In difficult and life threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account,"" Pence said. The governor reiterated his belief that it is a challenging time to be in law enforcement and doubled down that ""we ought to set aside this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias."" He finished his answer by saying it's time to ""move away from the rhetoric of division and embrace the rhetoric of unity."" The governor expressed his opinion that when tragedies happen, voices of division come forward instead of voices of unity, though he did not directly mention President Barack Obama's leadership. Asked Wednesday about the police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa, Trump did not address the Charlotte incident but said he was ""very, very troubled"" by the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, in Tulsa on Friday night.

238,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's moment of truth with the Obama coalition is fast approaching -- and she has work to do. The Democratic nominee's effort to win over voters who twice put Barack Obama in the White House -- and who represent her best chance of victory in November -- will reach new intensity this week in the run-up to her first crucial debate clash in seven days. Young, college-educated and minority voters formed the backbone of Obama's majority in 2008, helping to put once reliably Republican states like Virginia and North Carolina in the Democratic column and shore up the battered incumbent in swing states like Ohio and Florida in 2012. But recent polls indicate the race tightened dramatically in recent weeks, with GOP nominee Donald Trump on a roll. They suggest that Clinton is lagging behind Obama with younger voters and that she has failed to kindle the enthusiasm that drove them to the polls four and eight years ago. Questions are also mounting about the scale of likely turnout among black and Hispanic voters, who are expected to vote disproportionately for Clinton but could let her down if they do not show up in sufficient numbers in battleground states. Obama delivered a direct appeal to these voters over the weekend at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner where he made a passionate plea to his supporters to show up in November for Clinton. Clinton eyes NC as a firewall in tightening race After appealing to forums of African-American and Hispanic leaders in recent days, Clinton will travel to crucial Pennsylvania on Monday to highlight the stakes for millennials. She previewed the likely thrust of her remarks last week in North Carolina in a more personal, emotive stump speech that she retooled while laid up with pneumonia. ""I am running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better,"" Clinton said. In that speech, the Democratic nominee also reached out to other sectors of the Obama coalition, including LGBT voters, African Americans and those who secured health care under the current president. Clinton's running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, made a forceful push for millennial votes on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, arguing that on the issues young people care about most, like climate change, women's health, college affordability, immigration reform and LGBT equality, there was only one possible choice in November. ""It's on our shoulders to make the case. But on at least five litmus test issues, the differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vast,"" Kaine said. Clinton's need to improve her standing among young voters has become apparent in recent polling. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that Clinton was backed by 31% of voters aged 18-34 while 29% favored Trump. But 44% of that group said they would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Party leader Jill Stein. Other polls have also shown Clinton needing to improve her standing among the younger demographic. If she does not, it could harm her election chances because she is far more dependent on the youth vote than Trump, as the core Republican vote skews much older. A CNN/ORC poll last week had Clinton leading Trump by 54% to 29% among voters under the age of 45. But she's running behind Obama, who beat Romney 60% to 37% among the same group in 2012. While the former secretary of state has work to do to electrify the Democratic coalition, she could not have better allies. Most prominently, Obama himself, enjoying some of the best approval ratings of his presidency, is emerging as a passionate, adamant fighter for her cause. First lady Michelle Obama is also taking on a key role. Following her acclaimed speech at the Democratic National Convention this July, she told young voters in Virginia last week that their choice in November would decide whether they could afford a college education and keep their health care when they graduate. Even Clinton's bitter primary rival, Bernie Sanders, who became a rock star on college campuses and among young voters, is beginning to become more prominent as an advocate warning of the dangers of a Trump presidency. However, transferring support from one candidate to another is not just a simple matter of passing the baton. Obama's popularity among Democrats seems intimately attached to the President himself. His efforts to boost Democrats in mid-term elections in 2010 and 2014 had little effect, and his record on picking winners in off-year races is also patchy. It's left the impression that his is a uniquely ""Obama"" coalition that cannot be easily bequeathed to a successor. RELATED: Obama: Would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back Clinton That may be one reason why Obama's appeal to black voters at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner on Saturday was so striking; he figuratively put himself on the ticket in November, urging African Americans to vote for him and his legacy. ""My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,"" he said. ""After we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,"" Obama said in strikingly direct remarks. ""You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote."" Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday that the President's comments were aimed at voters who were turned off by the negativity of the campaign that the ""stakes are too high"" to tune out. ""I think the impact is to send a clear message to the President's supporters across the country that even though his name isn't on the ballot, he feels passionately about the outcome of this race,"" Earnest said. The process of transferring Obama's African-American support to Clinton was given a significant lift by Trump's clumsy effort to lay to rest the ""birther"" controversy over his repeated false claims that the President may not have been born in the United States, and hence wasn't eligible for the country's highest office. Though the GOP nominee finally admitted on Friday that Obama was indeed born on American soil, he gave the controversy fresh life by claiming inaccurately that Clinton's 2008 campaign started the furor and that he ended it -- despite pushing the rumor years after Obama produced his birth certificate. ""If you would ask me to come up with one thing that would ruin Donald Trump's momentum over the last three weeks, I would say bringing up the birther thing,"" said Kevin Madden, a former top Romney strategist, on CNN's ""State of the Union Sunday. ""In many ways it has brought up new questions and in many ways it has put the spotlight again on Donald Trump in a very negative way."" For her part, Clinton, despite facing the historically daunting task of trying to win a third consecutive White House term for her party, is hugging Obama close. She paid a fulsome tribute to the President at the CBC dinner and vowed to work tirelessly for a strong African-American turnout in November. ""I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted,"" she said. ""I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together."" Trump's cause, however, has been boosted by a string of recent polls showing that the GOP nominee has all but neutralized Clinton's big convention bounce. And his campaign is suggesting that she will fail to pull off the kind of high turnout among key Democratic constituencies she needs to win in November. ""Bernie Sanders had an event yesterday in Ohio for Hillary Clinton. There were 150 people there,"" Trump campaign manager KellyAnne Conway said on CBS ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""That's like a second wedding where I come from. This is not a big movement for Hillary Clinton."" While the activity of last week and the coming one suggests that the Clinton campaign is concerned about its candidate's progress in reassembling the Obama coalition, the countdown to Election Day could serve to concentrate the minds of Democratic voters. Young voters are notoriously less likely to show up at the polls than older ones, but they confounded conventional wisdom when they repeatedly answered Obama's call in primary elections and general elections. In 2012, Republicans backing Romney were adamant that Obama would never recreate the kind of historic turnout, especially among black voters, that he had managed in 2008 when he leveraged the historic potential of the first African-American presidency. It was only on Election Day, when returns started trickling in from key counties in swing states from Florida to Ohio, that the Romney brain trust learned how wrong they were. But with Clinton's fate on the line, that coalition is now facing its final -- and most daunting -- test. ",1,0,0
253,"Philadelphia (CNN)Hillary Clinton made a direct appeal Monday to a demographic group that continues to be deeply skeptical of the Democratic nominee: millennials. Addressing a largely younger crowd here at Temple University, Clinton argued that her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, does not share their values, and that in contrast, she has fought her entire life for children and young people and would be their biggest advocate in the White House. Clinton said that young people she has spoken with to over the course of this campaign have expressed concerns about divisiveness and discrimination. ""Too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans, bullied; too many young women and men assaulted,"" Clinton said. Clinton emphasized efforts to promote affordable tuition and combat college debt. These topics were at the core of the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders -- the raspy, populist Vermont senator who proved to be formidable challenger to Clinton as he overwhelmingly won the support of young people and liberals. ""As you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up,"" Clinton said. The crowd broke out into cheers as Clinton continued: ""I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan."" In a speech that drew on her history as a young Democratic activist as well as personal anecdotes about her mother, Clinton openly acknowledged this obvious truth: that young people are disenchanted and disillusioned with the current political system. ""I remember wrestling with the challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War,"" Clinton said. ""It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing is ever going to change."" Younger voters overwhelmingly backed President Barack Obama in 2012 -- giving him a 29 point lead over Republican nominee Mitt Romney, according to exit polls. In 2008, Obama easily outpolled Republican John McCain among -- 66% to 32%. But the enthusiasm that young voters -- including many first-time voters -- showered on Obama, however, has not transferred over to Clinton. One obstacle getting in Clinton's way: third party candidates. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 36% of voters under 30 plan to support Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or the Green Party's Jill Stein. With just 50 days left until Election Day, the Clinton campaign is relying heavily on popular, big-name Democratic surrogates to help court undecided and unenthusiastic voters. Last week, it dispatched Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to battleground states. And Priorities USA, a super PAC backing Clinton, announced last week that they are launching a multimillion-dollar digital campaign to discuss ""how a vote for a third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump."" Priorities has conducted polling on voters backing Johnson and Stein -- research they will use to determine how those individuals can be persuaded to back Clinton, according to Priorities spokesman Justin Barasky. The lead that Clinton has enjoyed since the Democratic National Convention in July has largely evaporated, and she is now neck-and-neck with Trump in both national and swing state polls. ""This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines,"" Clinton said Monday. ""Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump's hands."" A vote against Trump, Clinton concluded, would show that world that ""America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump."" ",1,0,0
255,"(CNN)The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN. Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials. That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike. Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed. But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified. Syria ceasefire under threat after US-led strikes kill regime troops, Russia says Officials told CNN they believe a likely scenario is the personnel hit were prisoners of the regime, perhaps military personnel being detained, although that is not certain. The initial signs indicate they were dressed in civilian clothing. They also may not have had the typical weapons of a Syrian military unit but rather trucks with weapons mounted on top of them. It is also not known if they were deliberately placed there to potentially deceive the coalition. The strike happened about two kilometres outside the airport in Deir Ezzor, where the US did not expect Syrian forces to be located. The US had struck ISIS strongholds in the area of Deir Ezzor dozens of times in recent months, but had not seen Syrian forces at this location. Syria ceasefire: Is Bashar al-Assad preparing to breach it? Gen. Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, has appointed a one-star general to conduct an investigation, but as of early Monday that name had not been released. The US expressed regret for the incident, but it still sparked a furious diplomatic row at an emergency UN Security Council meeting over the weekend. The US remains insistent that it does not target Syrian forces, only ISIS and al Qaeda, officials said. While the strike has raised tensions with Russia over the effort to make a potential ceasefire work, it also comes as the pace of operations against ISIS strongholds in Iraq's Mosul and Syria's Raqqa is picking up. In northern Syria, US Special Operations Forces remain partnered with Turkish forces and plan to move with them throughout the area, including the town of Al Rai. US officials told CNN that despite video emerging last week that appeared to show Turkish and US forces being asked to leave the town, they have remained in the area. There is also growing intelligence that ISIS is hunkering down for major combat in Mosul as Iraqi forces draw closer. US surveillance has shown a growing number of improvised explosive devices, bombs, tunnels, trenches and firepits have been dug. The US also believes ISIS has put bombs on all the major bridges into the city, one official said. ",1,0,0
304,"United Nations (CNN)President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea Tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis ""of epic proportions,"" despite a political backlash in the US against absorbing those fleeing Middle East violence. The President's interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world, and pushing back against the anti-refugee tenor, was underscored by his decision to convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees at the United Nations Tuesday. At the summit, he also rejected another aspect of the American political debate swirling around accepting foreigners -- GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's call to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. ""This crisis is a test of our common humanity. Whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another,"" Obama said, though he didn't mention Trump by name. Obama singled out the situation in Syria, which has displaced 4.8 million people so far, as particularly ""unacceptable."" ""We are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop,"" he said, describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries' ability to take collective action. ""I called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time,"" he said. ""Just as failure to act in the past -- for example, by turning away Jews fleeing Nazi Germany -- is a stain on our collective conscience, I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment."" The refugee issue is one that's captured the world's attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since World War II, seared into the public's consciousness by photos like that of a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean and the flood of migrants into Europe. A recent study by from the UN's refugee agency estimated 65.3 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015, up by over five million from the prior year. Many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries, but about 21.3 million are classified as refugees. Obama's summit follows a similar UN-led meeting on the issue Monday, which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments. RELATED: Donald Trump Jr. likens Syrian refugees to Skittles candy ""Make no mistake,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the UN meeting, ""additional efforts are urgently needed."" Leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows -- acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions. ""You have to know that today the European Union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said in his remarks, signaling a growing sense that patience in Europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin. ""There will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants,"" he added. The Obama administration is hopeful the Leader's Summit on Tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action. National Security Advisor Susan Rice in June announced that the gathering -- co-hosted along with the US by Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico, Sweden and the UN Secretary General -- would seek an increase in funding of at least 30%, a doubling of permanent resettlement, and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees. ""Reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging, yet the level of need demands no less,"" Rice said in a statement. But aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed. ""We have to be optimistic that we'll see some real concrete commitments,"" said Amnesty International's Interim Executive Director Margaret Huang. ""But the truth is, even if those numbers are hit, it's nowhere near what's actually needed."" The US is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees -- particularly Syria's neighbors -- and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to America from 85,000 in 2016 to 110,000 next year. The President's chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action, it is limited in what it can do. ""The President's commitment to ensuring that the United States plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in Congress, including by a lot of people in the Republican majority in Congress,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. ""And that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort."" Vetting efforts to screen refugees, he noted, ""are not cheap."" RELATED: Boat survivor: I am a refugee with a voice David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee and a former British Foreign Secretary, said he's hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action. ""The scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response,"" Miliband told CNN. ""Governments around the world haven't, in the main, been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now."" But the co-hosts of the Leaders' Summit said in a statement they were pleased with ""new and significant humanitarian contributions"" from world leaders. ""We sought a $3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years,"" they said. ""Through our mutual efforts, over the course of 2016, the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 4.5 billion additional dollars to UN appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015."" As they await action from world leaders in New York, a group of volunteers in London laid out a ""life jacket graveyard"" Monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants who've lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the Mediterranean. The conflict in Syria and resulting migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months, but refugees are a global problem. Perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the so-called ""global south"" -- the developing countries of the southern hemisphere. Last week, South Sudan joined the ranks of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia -- countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad. And protracted conflict in places like Somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees -- men and women in their twenties who've never known life outside of a camp. ""These are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries,"" Huang said. ",1,0,0
1536,"CNN had an ominous headline today (it’s showing on google but they changed it on the story): Trump, Netanyahu meet for nearly 90 minutes. It’s like a BIG DEAL to CNN that Netanyaho met with Trump longer than Clinton saying that ‘Her meeting with the prime minister was somewhat shorter than his talk Sunday morning with Trump. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Hillary Clinton Sunday night at a New York hotel, after conferring earlier in the day with Donald Trump for nearly 90 minutes at Trump Tower’.   So why do you think Netanyahu met longer with Trump than Hillary? Well Hillary has been the Secretary of State during an unprecedented time where the United State’s devotion to Israel has waned dramatically. Under Hillary as Secretary of State, the U.S. has given over $100 billion to the terrorist regime in Iran whom Obama supports over Israel. This is what leaders look like.  The meetings between Netanyahu and Trump and Hillary materialized over 24 hours on Friday. Trump’s aid made a phone call to one of the prime minister’s advisers. Once it was clear that a meeting was going to happen, Netanyahu’s office contacted Clinton’s campaign to hold a meeting with her as well, to keep the balance. The Prime Minister’s senior official explained that, “The prime minister’s instruction was clear – if we meet with one side, we must also meet with the other side. We are following the number of meetings to make sure that one side doesn’t get more meetings than the other.” The Trump campaign statement said during the meeting, “Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America,” amid the backdrop of speculation that Trump would support cutting U.S. military aid to Israel. Trump told Netanyahu that if elected, “there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries.” Trump added that Israel is a “vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism.” The two also discussed the nuclear deal with Iran and the fight against ISIS. “Mr. Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish People for over 3000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel,” the statement read. “Mr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism,” according to the statement. “He agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.” Does Hillary have anything to worry about since she has hardly been able to retain a stable relationship between the US and Israel and now Trump is asking for private audiences reaffirming traditional promises the US has had with Israel since before the Obama Presidency? When it comes to looking Presidential, Trump is really kicking Hillary’s butt.    Readout Of Donald J.

1573,"Animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.  You know what? Don’t even read further if you are part of the man’s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year. You can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung’s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What’s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.  Local people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog. Many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung’s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.   Loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since. A dog lover’s club in Thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of Loung…hoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal. ",0,0,1
1440,"We’ve never seen anything like this before in the sport of NASCAR… There are many people that don’t believe in things that NASCAR does. But those are mostly things like penalties and rules on the track. It’s not often that we say anyone complain about how the sport treats and includes people, simply because everyone for the most part thinks NASCAR does a pretty swell job. But it looks like there’s ONE person who disagrees. That one person is Terrance Cox III, a Georgia man who has operated Diversity Motorsports Racing as well created a group to protest against NASCAR, alleging that officials, teams and owners are unjust towards the minority community.  This past Friday, Cox filed a $500 million race discrimination lawsuit against NASCAR and its race teams due to claims that the sanctioning body of NASCAR would never help him as he tried to make NASCAR more racially diverse. In Cox’s complaint, he stated that “potential sponsors were encouraged by NASCAR to not work with him but instead go for drivers like Tony Stewart and Dale Jr.” They also allegedly refused to promote different programs that Cox created in order to make NASCAR more diverse.  Lastly, Cox is claiming that NASCAR has “engaged in unlawful intentional racial discrimination by refusing to sanction African-American owned racing teams … and by refusing to hire African-American drivers for its racing teams.” Has NASCAR responded to this? HELL YEAH! They’ve released a statement defending their Drive for Diversity program and have let Cox and everyone know that they are going to fight this lawsuit. “NASCAR embraces all individuals interested and involved in our sport, whether as partners, fans, competitors or employees, and there is no merit to this lawsuit. NASCAR has a long-standing history of investing in diversity efforts including the NASCAR Drive for Diversity, NASCAR Diversity Internship and NASCAR Diversity Pit Crew Development programs. … We stand behind our actions, and will not let a publicity-seeking legal action deter us from our mission. NASCAR not only will defend our organization against these meritless allegations, but we will be asserting our own claims against Mr. Cox for his defamatory actions. We established these [diversity] programs to create opportunities for women and minorities, and embrace people of all backgrounds, within the industry. Diversity both on and off the track continues to be a top priority for NASCAR and its stakeholders.“ There is one full-time African-American driver in NASCAR and his name is Darrell Wallace Jr. Wallace races for Roush Fenway Racing and competes in the Xfinity Series.

358,"Sanders' next book, ""Our Revolution,"" is being adapted for teenagers and being pitched to booksellers as a high school graduation gift. The young adult version of the book, which is not yet titled, will come out in April 2017, according to the publisher, Henry Holt Books for Young Readers. The publisher shared details about the book project with CNNMoney on Wednesday. Policy-oriented books are de rigueur for politicians. But they're usually written for adult readers and read only by devoted supporters and policy wonks. Sanders is doing something unusual by targeting the teenage market. The book will be written for 12- to 18-year-olds. The list price will be $17, $10 less than the edition for adults. Sanders' interest in reaching young readers is in line with his recent bid for president, which tapped into a deep well of support from young voters. Since conceding the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, and endorsing her in the presidential race, he has spoken at length about the importance of motivating young people to care about the electoral process. He recently told The Nation that Democrats have got to open the door to young people."" The party needs to ""[w]elcome them in and understand that it will be messy, that many young people are not professional politicians,"" he said. ""The Democratic Party is going to have to adjust itself to their reality, rather than force young people to be adjusted to the Democratic leadership's reality."" Sanders is currently wrapping up ""Our Revolution,"" which will come out on November 15, one week after Election Day. It is being published by Thomas Dunne Books. Both that imprint and Henry Holt are owned by Macmillan. The young adult edition will follow five months later. Henry Holt describes it as ""an inspiring teen guide to engaging with and shaping the world — a perfect gift and important read.""",1,0,0

26,"Aid to Syria has been suspended after yesterday's attack on a United Nations and Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy in the countryside of Aleppo. The convoy was delivering wheat flour, health supplies and other emergency aid to some 75,000 people in Urum al-Kubra in rural Aleppo, according to the U.N. Of the 31 trucks in the convoy, at least 18 were hit. A Syrian Red Crescent warehouse was also destroyed and a health clinic severely damaged, the U.N. said. About 20 civilians and one SARC staff member were killed as they were unloading the trucks, according to a joint statement from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The convoys that we had hoped to move across the border to Syria as well as aid inside Syria have been temporarily put on hold. As a result, millions of people across Syria run a very real risk of not receiving the assistance they need because of this callous attack,"" David Swanson, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told ABC News. He noted that all parties to the conflict were notified about the convoy and that it was marked with aid signs. ""Obviously, we are absolutely outraged that such an attack can take place,"" he said. The U.N.'s aid coordinator said the attack on the aid convoy could amount to a war crime. ""Let me be clear: If this callous attack is found to be a deliberate targeting of humanitarians, it would amount to a war crime. I call for an immediate, impartial and independent investigation into this deadly incident,"" Stephen O’Brien, the U.N.'s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement after the attack. The Red Crescent in Aleppo confirmed in a statement that Omar Barakat, SARC's director in Urum al-Kubra, was among those killed. Yousef Houran, a lawyer and activist in Syria, said he witnessed aid trucks burning after the attack in Urum al-Kubra. ""Bodies of Red Crescent volunteers are still burning inside the cars and no one can get close to them because of repeated airstrikes on the same spot,"" he told ABC News last night following the attack.  Our thoughts go to families of brave @SYRedCrescent volunteers & staff killed in tonight's terrible attack on aid convoy in rural #Aleppo  Two U.N. trucks carrying flour and food supplies — enough to feed about 185,000 people for one month — have been parked by the Syria-Turkey border, waiting for security assurances in order to make the journey into the besieged eastern Aleppo. These trucks will remain parked until the U.N. re-evaluates the situation on the ground. Today, the four besieged towns of Madaya, Zabadani, Foua and Kefraya were supposed to receive humanitarian assistance, but the U.N. has also put these deliveries on hold indefinitely. After the Syrian military declared the end of the U.S.-Russian-brokered truce last night, airstrikes hit several areas in Aleppo. ""We heard from a partner from Aleppo that there were 100 airstrikes in about five hours yesterday,"" Misty Buswell, Save the Children's regional advocacy director for the Middle East, told ABC News. ""It's brutal what is going on right now and there has to be accountability for what happened last night. This is not the first time that we have seen aid being attacked in Syria. This demonstrates the new lows that this conflict has reached. We’re hearing that hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of casualties that are coming in today."" At least 38 civilians, including one child and three women, were killed by airstrikes in Aleppo and its western and eastern countryside, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Today, airstrikes continued and the observatory said that warplanes dropped 27 barrel bombs on different neighborhoods in Aleppo city. After an International Syria Support Group meeting today, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters that ""the cease-fire is not dead."" The U.N.'s special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, echoed that statement but warned that the cease-fire is ""in danger."" The group is due to meet again on Friday. The cease-fire pact focused on reducing violence in the war-torn country and delivering humanitarian aid. The agreement had to be reached before Russia and the U.S. would work together to fight militant groups ISIS and al-Nusra in Syria. After yesterday's attack on the aid convoy, the U.S. Department of State released a statement yesterday saying it would now reconsider the prospect of cooperating with Russia. ""The United States is outraged by reports that a humanitarian aid convoy was bombed near Aleppo today,"" the statement read. ""For more than a week, we have urged Moscow to fulfill the commitments it made in Geneva to facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. And for more than a week, the Syrian regime repeatedly denied entry to these U.N. convoys, preventing them from delivering urgent food, water and medical supplies to desperate Syrian citizens. Only today did the regime finally grant permits for some convoys to proceed. The destination of this convoy was known to the Syrian regime and the Russian federation and yet these aid workers were killed in their attempt to provide relief to the Syrian people. The United States will raise this issue directly with Russia. Given the egregious violation of the Cessation of Hostilities we will reassess the future prospects for cooperation with Russia.""

1268,"Former Attorney General Ed Meese, a long-time aide to Ronald Reagan and a one-time critic of Donald Trump's candidacy for president, has joined the Republican nominee's transition team, according to two people briefed on the hire. Meese's decision to join the transition team might raise eyebrows among Trump's die-hard supporters. Meese joined a slew of prominent Republicans in bashing Trump earlier this year in National Review, the conservative magazine that has led the charge against the Manhattan businessman. Story Continued Below Meese wrote in January that Trump's ""broadsides"" against fellow GOP candidates had served ""to divide and discourage potential Republican-party supporters."" ""Questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run, or that another cannot be elected, or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy, are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign: restoring economic growth, strengthening national security, eliminating cronyism and corruption, and improving the lives of all Americans,"" he added. But with Trump's nomination cemented and the polls tightening, Meese and other Trump critics like Ted Cruz are beginning to come around. Two sources said Meese is heading a Trump transition group focused on the Executive Office of the President, which includes the Office of Management and Budget. Meese declined to comment, and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Meese was an aide to Reagan during his time as governor of California. He led Reagan's presidential transition team in 1980 and later served as Reagan's attorney general before resigning in July 1988 following a special prosecutor's inquiry involving his ties to an Army contractor and an Iraqi pipeline project. He is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Trump's transition team, which is led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is rapidly expanding, with one source telling POLITICO that nearly 100 people are now involved in the effort. And even as some Republicans refuse to take part, Christie and his staff have managed to recruit people with both establishment and conservative credentials, including former Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner and Eric Ueland, the Senate Budget Committee's Republican staff director. In addition to Meese and Feulner, sources told POLITICO that Paul Winfree, another Heritage Foundation official, is also working on the Trump transition. Winfree declined to comment.",1,0,0

670,"Most Americans don’t realize that all revolutions aren’t the result of overt force. Hitler, for instance, was voted into power in Germany, as was Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Currently in the United States we are in the process of such a revolution by the progressive controlled Democrat party – sadly too many Americans are oblivious to what is happening. It is impossible to know for sure whether this revolution is being orchestrated by a SPECTRE-like secret cabal, or is the result of years of progressive fellow travelers advancing similar goals. In either case what has resulted is in essence a coup. America’s progressive revolution is being fought with ballots rather than bullets, and the progressives are winning. In order to do this the progressive movement had to overcome traditional American values or they would never be successful electing their way to power. Seriously, if the Democrat Party had run with its present polices 60 years ago they would have not have come close to winning a single state. So how have they managed to get to where they are today? In the ‘60’s progressives, then called liberals started taking over the liberal arts departments of our colleges and universities. Those humanity majors they converted to their ideology went into journalism, education, and the entertainment media. Whether it was by plan or by inclination most of these liberal college grads joined the Democrat party. Since Kennedy every single Democrat nominee for president has championed the progressive ideology. You could argue that Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton who were more opportunists than true believers, but that didn’t stop them from supporting progressive goals. Today you’d have a tough time finding even a moderate Democrat candidate. Heck, nearly half of the party was fine with nominating a self-described socialist. Along with a news and entertainment media protecting Democrats, and the education system promoting the progressive ideology you have former and current Democrats in government sponsoring policies that garner still more votes and thereby gain more power. Does anyone honestly believe that a picture ID is that difficult to come by? Democrats are all for anything legal, quasi-legal, and some would say even illegal to recruit more voters. Immigrants and refugees are welcomed, given entitlements and are set to be Democratic voters as soon as possible. We all remember the ACORN voter fraud scandal, but if anyone seriously thinks that that was an isolated incident should really think again. The progressive revolution is ongoing. There are around 300 so-called sanctuary cities in the United States. These progressive cities refuse to obey the law of the land and have gotten away with it. Likewise whole states refuse to follow federal laws when they don’t agree with them. Worse, our current president, and cabinet officers, and whole departments in the federal government ignore their oaths to defend the Constitution. And, thanks to the timid establishment Republicans have done so with impunity. When the Attorney General of the United States Eric Holder lied to Congress without consequences – other than being found in contempt of Congress – we have a coup going on. When the IRS can use its power to punish political enemies of the administration going so far as to destroy evidence, that is a revolution. And certainly when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law but is protected by the State Department, and the Department of Justice refuses to indict, we have a collapse of the rule of law. That is what happens in a coup. Certainly President Obama acts as if he doesn’t have to follow the Constitution. For now many of his more overt executive orders have been blocked by the courts, but as the progressive revolution grows in strength the Democrats appoint more and more judges who view the Constitution as a living document. It is doubtful that the progressive revolution is led by Obama or his handlers; they just take advantage of the increasing progressive power in the country. President Obama has an arrogance about him that drives him to foreshadow events like the IRS investigation, Hillary Clinton’s email investigation, and a possible rigging of the 2016 election. [Read Related Article: Did Obama Just Foreshadow a RIGGED Election Come November?] When he was elected he did the same thing. In 2008 he said, “We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.” That is what he’s done and progressive will continue to try to do. Hillary, if elected will continue the progressive coup, possibly beyond our power to reverse. A Trump victory, like Ronald Reagan’s, will slow it down, but it must take a sustained effort to confront our loss of freedom.

204,"The cornerstone of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign can be summed up in just a few words: Things suck and it’s all Obama’s fault. For Trump, this tweet pretty much optimizes his take on poverty: Our country does not feel ‘great already’ to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2016  This was in response to President Obama saying during the Democratic National Convention that “America is already great.” So, who is correct? Are Americans trapped in a socioeconomic hell hole or are things far more optimistic? According to a study published by the , things are vastly better for Americans than they were when Obama took office in 2009. The article began by profiling Alex Caicedo of Gaithersburg, MD. A few years ago, Caicedo was struggling with odd and part time jobs. He and his family were forced to live with his mother-in-law. Today, he has a steady middle class job with benefits and the family is ready to move out of his mother-in-law’s home. They are far from alone. The Caicedos are among the 3.5 million Americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year, according to census data released this month. More than seven years after the recession ended, employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor, creating more jobs, especially among retailers, restaurants and hotels, and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements. What about the minorities, who, according to Trump, have never had it worse? Well, that’s another Trump lie. Not only have minorities suffered much, much worse throughout history (slavery, Jim Crow), but they too have it dramatically better since Obama took office. Poverty declined among every group. But African-Americans and Hispanics — who account for more than 45 percent of those below the poverty line of $24,300 for a family of four in most states — experienced the largest improvement. Sorry, Republicans, but you don’t get an ounce of credit for the improvements. If anything, things would be much better if Republicans weren’t in office. The Times credits social programs like Social Security and food stamps for keeping people out of poverty. They also credit the fall in oil prices for people being able to commute to their jobs. One major factor, and Republicans will hate this, is that the increases in minimum wage are also taking people out of poverty. After a long period of rising inequality, Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington, added, the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward. Wage increases were “even stronger at the bottom than in the middle,” she said. Still, it’s not enough. 43 million Americans still live in poverty. Republicans have successfully blocked poor people from acquiring college degrees or job training that might help raise people out of poverty. For those without access to computers or the internet, finding a job can be burdensome. For those who can’t afford cars, a job search can be impossible. If this proves anything, it should be that it’s time to continue successful Democratic policies, not cut them off at the knees, as Republicans would do. ",0,1,0

As we should’ve expected, it took a good guy with a gun to end the situation. Hilarious (or pathetically?) it took the media a few days to identify this as an Islamist attack, despite the fact that the attacker was literally shouting “Allah Akbar” as he was stabbing people.

810,"The only convincing reason I can see for raising taxes is that it’ll mean less money in the pockets of George Soros. While liberals bemoan money in politics, it’s often those liberals funded by the likes of Soros doing the complaining. As of 2016, his net worth is nearly $25 billion. The right-wing Koch Brothers (worth 42.5 billion apiece) are wealthier, but Soros “invests” much more in politics than Soros does. Soros started the Open Society Institute in 1993 as a way to redistribute his wealth to progressive causes.  Using Open Society as a conduit, Soros has given more than $10 billion to a who’s who of left-wing groups. Imagine how many hungry people worldwide that much money could’ve saved, but instead he put that money towards organizations bent on destroying our civil society. This partial list of recipients of Soros’ money says it all: ACORN, Apollo Alliance, National Council of La Raza, Tides Foundation, Huffington Post, Southern Poverty Law Center, Soujourners, People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood, and the National Organization for Women. On the bright side, at least it’s his money he’s wasting going towards these causes, not federal money. At eighty-six years of age, the man is nearing the end of his life, and throwing money to whoever will take it at this point. He’s heavily backed Black Lives Matter, and now, is putting his money where his mouth is on the refugee issue. As Weasel Zippers reports: Billionaire George Soros said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he would invest $500 million to meet the needs of migrants. The White House announced the commitment from Soros and around 50 other companies ahead of Obama convening a refugee summit Tuesday afternoon. Soros also said that he plans to work more closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to assist in his investments. ‘In response, I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities. I will invest in startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves. Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world.’ ‘Governments must play the leading role in addressing this crisis by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure for migrants and refugees.’ The lifetime cost of admitting only the 10,000 refugees we admitted in America comes out to a large $6.5 billion. George Soros isn’t going to be getting much bang for his buck (especially when its ten times cheaper to resettle refugees in the Middle East than in America and Europe) but if he wants to waste his money, I’m all for that. I’d rather him not have it anyway. ",0,0,1
488,"Washington (CNN)When Hillary Clinton said that her Republican rival Donald Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump didn't deny it. In fact, he said: ""That makes me smart."" After the debate, he told CNN's Jim Acosta: ""Of course I've paid federal taxes."" Clinton was pressing Trump for not releasing his tax returns for public scrutiny. Trump has said he won't release his tax returns until a routine audit is complete, though every major party presidential candidate over the past 40 years have released tax returns. ""There is something he is hiding,"" Clinton said of Trump during the debate. ""Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax,"" she said.

496,"Washington (CNN)Former ""Miss Universe"" Alicia Machado said she cried when she heard Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton talk about her during the first presidential debate at Hofstra University Monday. ""Well, last night I was with my family, with my mom and with my daughter, we were watching the debate and you know, I was really surprised,"" she said in Spanish during a phone call with reporters set up by the Clinton campaign. ""And I started crying. I started crying because I never imagined that such an important person like her would care about my story, know about my story."" Machado was referencing a moment during the debate when Clinton slammed Donald Trump's for his past comments toward women -- which has become a key campaign issue that hits on his vulnerabilities with both Hispanics and women. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton had said. She continued: ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" Trump, seemingly caught off-guard, repeatedly interjected: ""Where did you find this?"" Clinton, according to aides, had been prepped on Machado's story going into the debate and aimed to use it as a way to counter sexism on Trump's part. The Democratic nominee's campaign quickly turned the exchange into what they hoped would be a lasting moment: They published a video about the former beauty pageant winner shortly after the debate, in addition to holding the press call. ""I lament that I could be an uncomfortable person for Mr. Trump, but that's how things were,"" Machado said in the phone call. ""And I know very well what's he's capable of, this man. And that's why I am fighting to make the community understand, now more than ever, that Latinos need to support the US, that we need to return all the beautiful and grand things the US has provided for us."" When asked how the back-and-forth has played with Spanish speaking media, a Clinton aide had a one-word response: ""H-U-G-E."" On Tuesday, Trump refused to back down from his criticism of Machado, telling ""Fox and Friends"" in an interview that Machado had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem."" ""She was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem,"" Trump said. ""Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl -- this was many years ago. And found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Theresa. And it wasn't quite that way but that's OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do."" Beauty queen encouraged to lose weight Machado competed and won the ""Miss Universe"" title representing Venezuela in 1996 when she was 19 years old -- but then she gained nearly 60 pounds, according to a CNN report at the time. ""Some people when they have pressure eat too much. Like me. Like Alicia,"" Trump said at the time. He was then executive producer of the Miss Universe Pageant. In 1997, rumors surfaced that Machado would be forced to give up her Miss Universe crown -- but Trump said he wouldn't let it happen, according to the CNN report. ""We had a choice of: termination or do this,"" he said at the time. ""We wanted to do this."" By ""this,"" he meant encourage her to lose weight. Machado told Inside Edition in May that she actually gained closer to 15 pounds and that Trump called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she is Latina, and ""Miss Piggy."" It made her feel ""so fat"" that it made her ""very depressed,"" she said. Trump told the New York Times that he pushed her to lose weight. ""To that, I will plead guilty,"" he said."" But Machado said that she was affected by the comments. ""After that episode, I was sick, had anorexia and bulimia for five years,"" she said. ""Over the past 20 years, I've gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this."" On Monday, after the presidential debate, she tweeted in Spanish, ""Thank you Mrs. Hillary Clinton your respect for women and our differences make you great! I'm with you!""

1495,"If you’re like me, you are eagerly awaiting the Donald Trump – Hillary Clinton debate. Don’t get me wrong – as a policy nerd, I am disheartened to see that America has embraced two candidates who rely hardly at all on policy discussions.   Trump advances himself through no-nonsense rhetoric aimed at Americans who are very understandably frustrated with the current culture of political correctness and weakness that permeates every branch of government. Hillary advances herself through lies, extortion and skillfully-crafted propaganda designed to hold out just long enough to dupe the American people into giving the unindicted felon a job promotion. Still, the debate should be entertaining as Hillary has a habit of melting-down when on-the-spot and Trump thrives off of pushing back against unfair assertions and unwarranted attacks. To emphasize how this debate is likely to be different, consider how Trump would have handled Candy Crowley’s shameful advocacy she pushed in 2012’s debate. As if going against Trump isn’t scary enough, Hillary is riding into the debate on a wave of ever-dropping polls. Most polls have had Hillary up considerably over Trump since the conclusion of the primaries. Then again, these polls have largely been rigged via selection bias and targeted samplings of respondents. The Real Clear Politics average (which averages the results of dozens of polls) has Hillary up by a measly 2.1%. When we account for the “bias factor,” we can see that at best, Hillary is dead even with Trump. The projections emerging from the polls indicate that given the downward trend Hillary is suffering, Trump is only a single state away from victory in November. That means a lot can change. The data is having an effect on even the most optimistic analysts. FiveThirtyEight has placed Hillary’s chance of winning declining from 70.6 percent on September 11th, to 56.8 percent on September 20th. While polls are becoming more and more meaningless (look at Karl Rove and his little whiteboard), the empirical reality is that Americans are souring on Hillary the more they learn about her whereas people decided on Trump ages ago. Many mistakenly believe that this is a two-person race. It’s not. It’s a race between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and “none of the above.” Those who support Trump have supported him for quite some time. They’re dedicated and view him as an agent of change. Those who vehemently support far-left policies are still embittered by the railroading of Bernie Sanders and these vote do not necessarily translate to votes for Hillary. In a direct, forced match-up between Hillary and Trump, it may be extremely tight. However, how many Democrats are just going to stay home rather than risk the embarrassment of having voted for Hillary? An even better question: if Hillary cannot stand up to Trump in a debate, will that finally demonstrate to liberals the validity of what Trump has been saying all along? That she is too weak to stand for America at a time when our prestige is slipping on the international stage? ",0,0,1
23,"Donald Trump Jr., a son of the Republican presidential nominee, took to Twitter on Monday to publish a graphic that likened Syrian refugees to Skittles. The graphic asked the question, “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful?”  This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN “That’s our Syrian refugee problem,” it reads. Trump added, “This image says it all.”   The tweet drew both sharp criticism and support in the form of responses, retweets and online comments. The uproar led Mars Inc., the parent company of the manufacturer of Skittles, to issue a statement. Mars tweeted, “Skittles are candy; refugees are people.”  pic.twitter.com/VUwYKzqujc Hillary Clinton’s traveling spokesman, Nick Merrill, retweeted Trump, saying, “This is disgusting.”  This is disgusting. https://t.co/Qygl03Cnc1 The White House announced last week that it wants to increase to 110,000 the number of refugees the U.S. accepts in the next fiscal year.

More than 11 million people — over half of Syria’s population — have fled their homes, according to the latest U.N. figures, with 6.6 million displaced in Syria and 4.8 million seeking refuge abroad.

1500,"Even though America’s focus at this time is either on NFL, or the race between two of the worst candidates in US history, the refugee problem all across the world still rages on and no more so than Europe. Over the last two years, the violent crimes perpetrated by Muslim refugees have shot through the roof. New Years of this year, Cologne, Germany faced several reports of gang rapes by Muslim men. Not only In Germany, but also in Sweden and many other European countries. The reports of violence in these host nations have been too much to bear for many of these countries and now one in particular is growing a pair and demanding it gain control of the situation.  Hungary’s controversial prime minister has called for the EU to gather up the refugees and send them off to northern Africa, or an island north of that, as they would be more accustomed to that particular culture. Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister suggested they should be ’rounded up and shipped out’ to ‘an island or some shore of North Africa’ where they can make their asylum applications. Many claim that Orban and his country whose government has been criticized by all sorts of self-righteous ‘rights’ groups for stirring up xenophobia and intolerance…isn’t that just dandy. If you want control over who comes across your borders, you are a xenophobe. To hell with sovereignty. They are basically saying ‘we control you. Go against our demands and face our wrath. We own you. Slave.’ This country has already put up barbed wire fences and they are catching flak for that too. Listen world… You all have your own countries, so mind your own damn business. If you are so disgusted about this Hungary thing, then you take them into your country. What kills me is all Hungary is asking for is that they do their asylum application BEFORE they are allowed into the country. ‘Those who came illegally must be rounded up and shipped out. We must set up large refugee camps outside the EU, with armed security and financial support provided by the Union. Everyone who came illegally must return there. There they can file for asylum.’ Did you catch that word, you progressive socialists? He said ‘ILLEGALLY’. Rules and laws are there for ALL to follow. Law and order.   ",0,0,1
1588,"Okay, I have to admit that last night I ONLY watched the debate to see Hillary have a seizure, collapse at the podium or go into a weird coughing fit like she does. None of those things happened. As a matter of fact everything about her look was flawless… makeup, wrinkles (where did they go my mom asked), new highlights, perfectly coiffed hair. I wondered how after months of strange episodes of coughing fits, falling, unable to walk up stairs without help, shuddering that looks like mini-seizures; how she was able to stand up for the entire debate without assistance. The first half of the debate, her eyelids looked heavy, but that went away about halfway through when whatever they gave her kicked in. My friend Nancee Jones said that she “was disappointed in Trump tonight but? he was going up against a Politician (which he is not) and a CONGENITAL LIAR. I don’t know if she specifically LIED tonight (maybe about him supporting the Iraq war??) but she is also a sociopath. There are two more debates and I DO PRAY he comes in better prepared and can get some zingers in there on those.” I agree, I was excited to watch Trump the first half, but then whatever Hillary took (conjecture) kicked in, she was like a general on a warpath. She didn’t care that her red suit already made her look aggressive, she allowed the claws to come out. She did an excellent job baiting Trump and the poor untrained debater, Trump, took that bait every time. Despite everyone agreeing that Hillary got the better of Trump, even the Liberal panel from PBS News Hour looked downtrodden, even dejected over her performance. Yes, Hillary won, but they complained that Hillary didn’t put out anything substantive. They didn’t feel the ‘leg tingle’ so to speak about her performance. They didn’t even look very enthusiastic that she had just wiped the floor with Trump’s expensive blond hair (that is NOT a hairpiece, I’ve seen it in person). Even Liberal CNN’s David Gergen said that Hillary didn’t do ENOUGH. Headline for his recent post states that: ‘Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough?’ Coming into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election. Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively, but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. For one thing, Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards. They have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver for so long that they crave something different. They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias. Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger. Equally to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters. She has been vexed with the issue of likability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully. While Hillary ‘won’ because her ‘arguing was good’, she lost because even her own people don’t feel a ‘connection’ to her. Of course they wouldn’t, she’s a monster. Someone else was happy that Hillary turned up such a turd at the debate and he doesn’t get to vote for either candidate. My favorite fact about the debacle last night called a debate is that there are whole stories on what ‘Putin’ thought of the debate… because we really care. In reality, we don’t, we’re still ‘Merica but it’s funny to see how interested the world still is in the United States. Russia’s state-run media practically announced that: Trump Won Putin’s Focus Group and judging from Russia’s state-sponsored Twitter coverage of the presidential debate, the Kremlin is anything but a swing state.   Presidential Candidates FIRST Debate 2016 Scandals  Gennifer Flowers: The first scandal of the debate erupted over the weekend as the candidates traded tweets over who they would invite to watch the debate live in New York. Hillary first announced plans to invite Mark Cuban, who has been critical of Trump, to which Trump responded with a threat to invite former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers. Trump’s quips are amazingly similar to the way I would respond to other’s nastiness. I really loved his twitter response:  If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016    Hi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!… — Gennifer Flowers (@gennflowers) September 24, 2016   Podium-gate: The next point of contention proves that “size does matter”, at least to Hillary Clinton. Last week, Hillary’s team demanded a step stool for their candidate so that the 5’4″ Hillary wouldn’t look small and frail beside the larger 6’2″ Trump. While the debate commission denied the step stool they did allow a “custom-made” podium which was presumably scaled down by exactly 14% to match Hillary’s relative stature…this is the status of American politics folks. Here’s a look at the podiums to be used last night:   Ear Mics: The next scandal arose out of the last Commander in Chief forum hosted by Matt Lauer in which Hillary was accused of wearing an ear piece so as to receive guidance from advisers during the discussion. According to the World Tribune, the issue prompted one Maryland voter to write a letter to the Federal Elections Commissioner, Matthew Petersen, seeking assurances that ear pieces would not be allowed though no such assurances were provided. That said, Carlos Greer, of the Commission on Presidential Debates, sent out a message to news organizations on Sept. 9 banning devices that would allow presidential debate moderators get directions from their news teams.

1342,"President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change. The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House. Story Continued Below Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.” And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.” The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both. ""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."") Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

268,"Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists. Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true. Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning. These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July. Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point. ""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday. Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings. The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago. Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump. ""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards. Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump. Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster"" The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17. Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said. TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time. This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps. ""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed."" Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point."" Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience."" ""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience."" This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday. Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator. According to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on ""issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle."" According to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.",1,0,0
347,"Orlando (CNN)Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable."" Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force. ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have."" Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night. ""Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage and honor and skill,"" she said. ""I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am, and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it's essential for the safety of our communities and our officers."" The racially charged issue of the deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage multiple times in the 2016 election, and Wednesday was not the first time that the Clinton has commented on the issue. This week, Scott -- a father of seven -- was killed by police in a parking lot when police officers were searching for another man to serve a warrant. His family has said that Scott was unarmed and reading a book in his car, but the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police says that Scott came out of the car with a gun. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, Crutcher was killed in a confrontation with police officers. Crutcher was unarmed, and videos of the incident shows Crutcher standing next to his car and falling to the ground after an officer shot him. The officer's attorney later said she was afraid Crutcher was trying to reach for a weapon. Clinton's Republican opponent, Donald Trump, also reacted to Crutcher's death on Wednesday, saying in Ohio that he was ""very troubled"" by the fatal shooting. ""I must tell you, I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. To me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do,"" Trump said. ""This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking.

1308,"If I hadn’t seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, I’d have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on Monday night. It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor. So what’s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump’s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be “unfit” for the presidency, which was Clinton’s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions—from his announcement speech on—the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump’s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters—and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought—do not hear him the way those of us who’ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he’s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn’t matter, because he’s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system. Story Continued Below If he’s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that’s a sign that he’s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night. Measured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is “unfit” for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him. And what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It’s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing. On the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then … the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the “birther” issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his “defenses”—that he ”took advantage of the laws of the nation” in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes—were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It’s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that “the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.” Moreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out “racist:’ charging he’d “stiffed” many of those who’d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.) Finally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the “look” of a president—a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of “stamina,” a smiling Clinton was ready. “Well,” she said, “as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.” That worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it’s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I’m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.",1,0,0
857,"An independent examiner has determined that Tyre King, the 13 year-old African-American boy fatally shot by Columbus, OH police last Wednesday, was “more likely than not” running away from an officer at the time he was shot. The conclusion would seem to contradict the official police narrative, which holds that King was shot in a confrontation with officers after “he pulled a realistic-looking BB gun on them”. King was shot at 7:42 pm last Wednesday after officers responded to reports of an armed robbery over $10 by a group of three African-American teenagers. According to the official police department report, “officers followed the males to an alley and attempted to take them into custody when one suspect pulled a gun from his waistband. One officer shot and struck the suspect multiple times.” The Columbus coroner’s office has completed an autopsy of King’s body but the results won’t be made public for at least six weeks. It was this delay that prompted King’s family to hire an independent medical examiner, Dr. Francisco Diaz, who is a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan and works as a medical examiner for Wayne County, MI. In a statement released by the King family’s attorney today, Diaz said that “based on the location and the direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds.” It is not in question that King was involved in the robbery; indeed his friend Demetrius Braxton, 19, who was with King that night and has since been arrested, said that King “wanted to rob somebody for money.” Diaz’s report, however, confirms the suspicions of many in the community and across the country that the use of lethal force by responding officers was unnecessary and that a story of King aiming his gun at the police had been concocted as a justification. Indeed Braxton’s account of the encounter, given before the results of Diaz’s investigation were reported, similarly contradicts the official narrative. He told the local newspaper that “the cops said ‘get down’ and We got down, but my friend [King] got up and ran … [and] when he ran, the cop shot him.” The last time we checked, petty thievery does not carry the death sentence in the United States of America. While many will be inclined to somehow argue that the boy deserves it for committing a robbery, consider this. When young white men are convicted of rape in America, like Brock Turner, judges let them walk because they think they deserve a second chance. When young African-Americans commit crimes, they are smeared as career criminals and executed on the spot. The King case is only the most recent in a long string of deadly encounters between young African-American men and the police, many of which have been muddled by the victims’ having been carrying BB guns made to look like authentic firearms. Given the ubiquity not only of BB guns but of actual firearms as well amongst white Americans the implication – and sometimes overt justification – by police that the mere presence of what looks like a weapon on a young African-American boy constitutes a deadly threat is questionable at best. The injustice of such encounters becomes even clearer when the victim has his back to the police, a situation in which lethal force should never be the answer. And what is most insidious about these cases is the apparently reflexive instinct of the police to lie, as they seem to have done in King’s case by claiming that he was pointing his weapon at officers when he was shot. Far more than the peaceful protests of Black Lives Matter, it is these fabricated standoffs between police and black youth that fuel the fiction of the “war on police.” Through their attorney, King’s family have asked that the public “continue to withhold final judgement until all the facts are known and vetted.” They have also called for an independent investigation into their son’s killing, saying that “The Columbus police department, the City of Columbus and most importantly Tyre King and his family deserve the benefit of an investigation from a law enforcement agency that has no direct impact from the outcome of that investigation.”",0,1,0
824,"Sheriff David Clarke talked to Neil Cavuto of Fox News. Clarke determines that the rioters behavior in Charlotte is of primitive and subhuman nature. Basically, he called them savage and uncivilized. Sheriff Clarke is right. If you watch any video footage of the Charlotte riots, then you will see nothing but idiots running around like maniacs, people stealing and breaking into multiple stores, vehicles being damaged, people being attacked for no reason. It’s nothing by mayhem by maniacs. None of these people resemble civilized humans. Clarke is right! These ingrates are subhuman. They’re less than human. They’re filthy degenerates who consistently ruin neighborhoods and they need to be fixed. When people commit crimes like this, then I don’t think they should be permitted to have kids. Sounds rough and crazy, but I’d love to see the government waltz through one of these neighborhoods, see someone they saw looting, and revoke their right to have kids. Hey, I saw you acting like an uncivilized moron in Charlotte. You know what, you’re done having kids. Unzip your pants and let’s sterilize you right here in front of everyone. If you’re that irresponsible now, then I can’t fathom you raising a child. If you do have a kid, they’ll be just like you, and we don’t want any of that. Here’s what else happened in the interview with Cavuto and Clarke – they point out that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun and would not drop his weapon. They point out the fact that democratic media outlets always REFUSE to provide that information. They want ratings. They want people mad. They’re literally spinning the story, or leaving out vital information, in order to get people irritated enough to riot, then they get some good ratings for covering it. It’s total nonsense and very irresponsible. In fact, I would say that the reason for the riots is the democratic news outlets. If they said from the start – the man had a gun, that’s why he got shot, then people wouldn’t really care. But that doesn’t get ratings, does it?  politistick – After Cavuto pointed out that major news headlines in the Democrat Media Complex, ranging from the Washington Post to the New York Times, conveniently left out the fact that Keith Lamont Scott, the black man shot by a black police officer, was armed and refused to drop his weapon, according to police, Sheriff Clarke, as is always the case, did not mince words in describing both the media malpractice as well as the rioters’ behavior. “It was done on purpose [the media leaving out that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun] to stoke up anger and resentment by the liberal mainstream media,” Sheriff Clarke asserted. The combination of uncivilized subhuman behavior and information left out of the news is what causes BS riots. Charlotte riots could have been avoided if democratic news outlets told the truth instead of pandering the urban culture for votes and ratings. ",0,0,1
1023,"The “horrible” shooting death of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Friday is “just unbearable and needs to be intolerable,” Hillary Clinton said Tuesday. Speaking to radio host Steve Harvey, Clinton anxiously contrasted herself and her opponent, Donald Trump. “Oh my gosh, can I have the whole hour?” Clinton said when asked what separates her from the Republican presidential nominee. “I think it really comes down to our visions and our values. You know, I have a vision where we continue to pursue equality and justice and opportunity for everybody.” Story Continued Below Clinton highlighted how she’s been a champion for minorities and women and touted her plans to raise incomes, create more good jobs, make colleges — including historically black colleges and universities — more affordable and address systemic racism before talking about the Tulsa shooting unprompted. “This horrible shooting — again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?” Clinton asked, referring to the incident in which Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was shot dead by police despite having his hands up as he walked to his SUV with armed officers behind him. “In Tulsa? An unarmed man? With his hands in the air? I mean, this is just unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.” For her part, Clinton suggested that she could be part of the solution to reform policing practices and remove bias by appealing to white Americans. “You know, maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people, say, ‘Look, this is not who we are.’ We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias,” Clinton said. “There are good, honorable, cool-headed police officers. We’ve seen them in action in New York over the last, you know, 48 hours because of the terrorist attack. We can do better. We have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable, and we’ve got to have law enforcement respect communities and communities respect law enforcement because they have to work together.” The former secretary of state also recalled meeting Marian Wright Edelman, who founded the Children’s Defense Fund, as a law school student. “That gave me the opportunity to really see what we need to do because I believe you’ve gotta change both laws and hearts,” Clinton said. “We’ve gotta change laws to protect people, to protect everything about them, and we’ve got to be a clear and loud voice for our society being what it should be: the city on the hill striving for the more perfect union,” she continued. “And that’s my view. And I don’t think that’s how my opponent sees it.”",1,0,0
666,"A Chat With The Devil The share of the small business market is dwindling. Almost all the sectors of the economy suffer – grocery stores, factories, small farms, etc. The negative impact is obvious in many aspects. We can pay visits to small towns and the abandoned and boarded stores as we tour their dead downtowns. Talk to farmers, who live in poverty on their 100-acre farms. They are looking for jobs. The corporate farms, which have the money to influence politicians, push for regulations that the small farmers can’t afford. The neo-lords drive them out and buy more and more of their land turning them into peasants. [Read Related Article: Who are the Neo-Lords?] Small business is the biggest creator of jobs. The middle class in America is suffering as a result of the elite-businessmen influencing legislation that destroys small business, and when they move their factories out of the country, they take what’s left of the jobs with them, leaving destruction in their wake. High taxes and other policies hurt big business, but kills small business. The increasing wealth in the hands of big business makes them more competitive. The foreign-made products that need cheap labor are welcome in the country since it is produced by our Big Business-men. They can move their factories abroad, while a small business can’t. On the other hand, pharmaceutical companies, which do not need cheap labor, operate in America. They are left to abuse the market by enjoying the ban on medicines made abroad from entering the country. The government decided that medicines made in England, Germany, France, Japan, etc. can’t be sold in the United States. Ironically, some medicines produced in America are sold to Chinese patients for a fraction of what they charge American patients. In fact, China negotiated recently further drug price cuts with our patriotic companies, lowering the prices for the Chinese in some cases, to less than 50%. Now, let’s sneak under the table and listen to a conversation between two elite businessmen… one is a tycoon and the other is his young protégé: – We will make the lake deeper; we can fish with our big boats, and they will drown with their small boats. – What do you mean? – We will make the government build extra infrastructure that benefits our big business and kills the small business. – Don’t they pay more taxes than we do? The government will use that money to help us kill them? – Yes, we’ll put them out of business using their own money. Now, their customers are ours; we swallowed the market. – Oh, it looks like some of them survived! – Not for long – we’re getting bigger, we can sell cheap. 10% profit is good for us, but for a small business owner, it wouldn’t even feed his kids. – We did it. They are out of business….Wait a minute, the relatively bigger ones are still in business! – Hmm….a free trade agreement will finish them….We will tell the government to sign a couple of these agreements. The manufacturers can’t compete with the products made by the slaves in China. – How about us? Would we be able to compete with the Chinese products? – For sure, no. But you know what? We can move our business to China. They can’t do that. They are too small to do it. – It looks like with the cheap merchandise sold by some of the small service businesses are flourishing. – Not for long. They will boom, then after some time they will die. As we keep closing the factories, we will keep firing workers. These jobless workers will have no money to spend, and the market will diminish. – Wouldn’t that hurt us as well? – Yes and we’ll be bankrupt. – How would this be good for us? – Did you forget that the politicians are ours? The government will bail us out. – With tax money paid by the people whom we fired? – Yes, and the government will feed the smaller business to the bigger one. We will buy them, and the government will pay. – Wouldn’t this mean that we have to downsize? – Precisely, and we fire more workers. – You mean the workers who paid the taxes that the government used to buy the smaller business for us that they used to work for? – Yes, we kill them with their own sword. We starve them and their children with their own money. – We have a Democrat president and a Republican Congress. Which one will help us? – Both. They are ours. One would decide and the other would approve. After they yell at the executives and box their ears. – The market is smaller now, what are we going to do? – No harm. If the middle class is diminishing in America, it is growing in China. What we lose here, we’ll gain there. – Don’t you feel bad for America and the Americans? – Ah… I feel good for my money. We used to be British, now we are Americans, and soon we’ll be Chinese. The king doesn’t care which kingdom he is ruling.

516,"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN)As soon as the first debate of the 2016 presidential election was over, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were quick to claim victory. But by the next morning, one of them had become far less cheerful. Just hours after Clinton and Trump clashed on stage at Hofstra University in one of the most highly anticipated political events in modern history, the two presidential nominees took markedly different tones as they reflected on the previous night's debate. Clinton and her aides showed all of the outward signs of a team riding high. The Democratic nominee boarded her plane at Westchester County Airport to applause and cheers from her staff. Before taking off to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally, a smiling candidate walked to the back of the plane to gloat to reporters about a ""great, great"" evening. ""One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Lets play two,'"" Clinton said. ""So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that."" How Clinton found her stride on gender And taking a dig at Trump's complaint after the debate that he was given a ""defective"" microphone, Clinton quipped: ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night."" And in fact, the Republican nominee did not appear to be having a good morning. Calling into Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" early Tuesday, Trump rattled off more than one complaint about the debate. His first target was NBC News' Lester Holt, the moderator of Monday night's debate. Just hours before, Trump had praised Holt in the spin room to CNN, saying the newscaster had done a ""great job"" and was ""very fair."" Those compliments were long gone. ""I had some hostile questions,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""He didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed. He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. There's no question about it."" Trump was still irritated -- and even conspiratorial -- about his microphone. ""My microphone was terrible,"" Trump complained. ""I wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?"" To top things off, Trump unloaded on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that the businessman's disparaging treatment of her had led to eating disorders and depression. With no apparent consideration for the political recklessness of his crude comments, Trump once again went after Machado's physical appearance, bringing her up on his own. ""That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst,"" Trump said. ""She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem."" Those remarks could prove to be detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and with the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president. Late Monday, the Clinton campaign released a new video featuring Machado. ""He'd tell me, 'You look ugly,' or, 'You look fat,'"" Machado says in the video. ""Sometimes he'd 'play' with me and say: 'Hello, Miss Piggy,' 'Hello, Miss Housekeeping.'"" Machado also held a press call Tuesday afternoon to respond to Trump's comments and express her support for Clinton. She told reporters that watching the 2016 election was like a ""really bad dream."" ""I never imagined in 20 years later I will be in this position,"" she said. ""Watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments."" Speaking in Raleigh Tuesday afternoon, Clinton continued to make digs at Trump's debate performance, saying it was ""very clear that he didn't prepare."" ""What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent,"" she said. ""It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter."" Marguerite Scott, a retired 68-year-old woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, said she was struck by Trump appearing to lose his composure during the debate. Scott lso chastised the GOP nominee for his comments Tuesday about Machado. ""Men in general should stop objectifying women. If she is fat, that is her business,"" Scott said. ""And to put her on blast like that shows what a misogynist person he is."" Asked what she thought of Trump's complaints about a defective microphone, Scott responded: ""We heard him loudly and clearly, and bigly!""

Members of the European Parliament last week said they were concerned about the “extraordinarily high numbers killed during police operations in the context of an intensified anti-crime and anti-drug campaign.” In a statement, they said: “MEPs urge the Philippines government to put an end to the current wave of extrajudicial executions and killings, launch an immediate investigation into them and adopt specific, comprehensive policies and programs in full compliance with national and international obligations and respect for human rights.” Duterte’s response was brief. “I read the condemnation of the EU against me. I will tell them, ‘f–k you.’ You’re doing it in atonement for your sins,” he told local government officials in Davao City, media in the Philippines reported. Also On Politico Paul Dallison The president said EU nations were hypocrites for attacking him because of their own bloody histories. “And then EU now has the gall to condemn me. I repeat it, ‘f–k you,’” he said. Duterte earlier this month called Barack Obama a “son of a b–ch” when it was suggested he would face questioning by the U.S. president about the war on drug crime, which has claimed more than 2,400 lives in just over two months.  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

761,"How mad do you have to be to be able to break a knife blade a girls neck when you stab her over 100 times? Apparently as mad as a Muslim man on Monday! This unemployed, 32-year-old Muslim bag of sh*t named Jamiv Usman got dumped by his then teenage girlfriend, Shannon Reynolds, and couldn’t handle it like a man. I believe she was 19 and he was 30 at the time. That’s perfectly within the legal limits if you’re at a strip club, but I don’t think a 30-year-old should be predatory towards a relationship with a 19-year-old. Especially if he’s unemployed and can’t even provide for a family because he’s a loser. She wanted the lazy jobless Muslim OUT of their apartment. She wanted him away from her child. She wanted NOTHING to do with this Muslim man who would soon turn violent. Jamiv Usman didn’t respond well to this. He was boiling over like a pot of hot water ready to soften egg noodles for dinner. Get the knife ready for the steak, because what happens next is absolute HORROR. After all her requests and demands for the psychopath Muslim to leave, he had the nerve to ask her for a drink of water. Sounds reasonable if you’re an employed Muslim providing for his woman, but that wasn’t the case with this Allahu Akbar creep. She said no and he literally tipped over like that pot of boiling water and BRUTALLY stabbed her over 100 times with a knife. He stabbed so hard that he BROKE THE KNIFE IN HER NECK!  Rightwing News – She wanted him out of her apartment and she told him to get out. Tensions were brewing and it eventually led Usman to stab Reynold’s over 100 times. The last straw for Usman was when he asked her to get him a drink of water and she said no. That’s when he grabbed a big kitchen knife and plunged it into her body over 100 times in front of the toddler. He stabbed her so hard that he broke the tip of the knife in her neck. Amazingly, she survived. She played dead. He left. She crawled to a bus stop and got help. Eventually she healed and was able to identify her stabber and watch a judge order Usman to serve up to 20 years in prison.   The good news is that this strong woman survived and recovered to see her Muslim attacker thrown to the wolves in prison. Hopefully the violent Muslim will serve his full 20 year sentence and learn his lesson in prison. Will he be shanked 100 times in the neck? Probably not. Those guys in prison know how to shank you once and make it count. The other 99 slashes would be for fun. I bet Shannon Reynolds also got sick of him being unable to be a responsible adult who is an equal force in a relationship. What did he do for her? Nothing, it seems. Muslim men are suppressors and oppressors. They’re like a woman’s worst nightmare. Why would any woman date a Muslim man? Don’t they know by now that Muslim men treat women worse than anything. I’m sure he could’ve found another gullible girl to date on a dating site. In fact, here’s a few ideas for dating sites specifically for Muslims! If these ever become a thing, then women can sign up to be abused, stabbed, and forced to drape themselves in a black 84-inch table cloth in 95 degree weather.

165,"President Obama is right — it appears the people running the Trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes. After Donald Trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it’s “never been worse” for them than it is right now, one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly. Wrong. As usual, no one in the Trump campaign learns their lesson. And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state. Trump’s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren’t successful in the last 50 years, it’s their own fault. She also said there wasn’t “any racism until Obama got elected” and skirted problems under the table: If you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly. Miller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a “stupid waste of time” and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to “the way they’re raised.” What does “the way they’re raised,” supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn’t vote (and couldn’t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids. Miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump’s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller’s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple “volunteer” to steer away any influence she once held. Once again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it’s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists. ",0,1,0
448,"(CNN)President Barack Obama sharply criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for saying earlier this week that the black community is in the worst shape it's ""ever been in before."" ""I think even most 8-year-olds will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people,"" Obama told ABC News in an interview that aired Friday on ""Good Morning America."" ""Jim Crow wasn't very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make even more progress in the future."" Obama's comments reflected the wide gulf between the President and Trump that came into greater focus this week as race again became a top issue in the 2016 campaign following fatal police shootings of African-American men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Speaking before a mostly white audience Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump spoke of the need to ""rebuild our inner cities."" ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said. The speech was part of a high-profile push by the Trump campaign to plug gaps in poll numbers with minority voters, and also to win over white voters turned off by divisive rhetoric from Trump that critics have repeatedly labeled as racist. Still, the effort has stumbled. By proposing the expansion of the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program as a way to improve urban policing -- and by engaging in a public re-litigation of the baseless ""birther"" controversy that critics labeled racist -- Trump spent much of the last week doing damage control with the same voters he'd hoped to attract. All the while, Obama has positioned himself as one of Trump's most vocal critics -- and rival Hillary Clinton's biggest cheerleader. Speaking to reporters gathered in the Oval Office last Friday, Obama sarcastically dismissed Trump's ""birther"" capitulation. ""I was pretty confident about where I was born, I think most people were as well,"" he said. ""My hope would be the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that."" And the president made a more earnest effort to rebut Trump when he spoke at the Congressional Black Caucus gala on Saturday, and said that he would consider it a ""personal insult"" to his legacy if black voters didn't turn out for Clinton. Newest absentee, registration numbers promising for Clinton ""If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect -- read up on your history. It matters. We've got to get people to vote,"" Obama said. ""I will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote."" At the event, Obama also criticized Trump for using hyperbolic language when discussing African-Americans, and suggested that Trump visit the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture for perspective. ""You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,"" he said. ""But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him."" Obama speaks at the museum's opening Friday. ",1,0,0
1235,"To fact check or not — that was the debate before the debate, one that pitted Hillary Clinton’s backers against Donald Trump supporters and even engaged some top journalists. But as the hour of the debate drew closer, only the comparatively small Bloomberg TV network publicly said it would be doing any sort of on-screen fact checks during the debate, running them periodically as part of their headline scroll. Story Continued Below Despite the demands from the Clinton campaign for more media fact checks in the wake of Matt Lauer’s failure to correct Trump’s assertions at NBC’s commander-in-chief forum, none of the major networks has publicly committed to doing concurrent on-screen fact-checking during the debate, when the audience is highest. That would leave the moderator, NBC News anchor Lester Holt, on his own in deciding whether to weigh in on the candidates’ claims — as both sides tried to publicly pressure him in the hours leading up to the debate. Democrats including vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine called fact-checking crucial to the debate, while Republicans echoed Trump’s demand that Holt refrain from intervening the way that Candy Crowley did in the second 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, when she sought to correct Romney on his claim that Obama hadn’t characterized the Benghazi attacks as terrorism. While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics. Of the networks POLITICO surveyed, only Bloomberg TV confirmed that it will be doing on-screen fact checking during the debate. Network spokespeople said the on-screen fact checks would need to be nearly instantaneous to correlate with the answer the candidate is giving, leading to some high editorial and technical hurdles. Only NBC, Holt’s home network, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage. Debate moderators and questioners have been more frequent targets than usual during this election cycle, with the Republican National Committee even going so far as to pull planned debates with NBC-related networks because it didn’t like how CNBC handled an early primary-election debate. The journalists moderating the debates and providing questions have been singled out by critics in both parties for offenses ranging from asking too many “gotcha” questions to tossing too many softballs. Some moderators were criticized for losing control of the debates, while others were knocked for being too controlling themselves. Lauer, who sat in silence while Trump insisted he never supported the Iraq war – despite well-known footage of him saying the opposite – was only the most recent big-name anchor to emerge from a highly touted campaign forum with his reputation challenged. And both the Trump and Clinton camps have made it clear that they’ll be scrutinizing Holt very closely. ""These are two of the most difficult people in American politics to interview for very different reasons,” said veteran CBS News anchor and debate moderator Bob Schieffer. ""So I think a moderators [of the three scheduled debates] are going to have their hands full. But I think all of them are veteran journalists and they will have done their homework by the time they get to the debate and they’ll do fine."" For 90 minutes, with no break, Holt will lob questions of his own choosing at the candidates, guiding how and when they will respond. Schieffer, who said he has not given advice to Holt but has to some of the other moderators, said the hardest part for a moderator is not the vaunted “fact checking” that Lauer was so criticized for not enacting, but rather keeping track of the time and making sure the candidates get to the point. “[Moderators] are always part of the story,” Schieffer said. ""When there’s someone to blame for something, people first turn to the press. That seems to be our role traditionally, that it’s our fault. You can’t help but become part of the story. You need to remember that going in. This scrutiny now is so intense, if you hadn’t been through it before you better get used to it now.” Despite the evident pressure, handling the first debate will be a huge opportunity for Holt, who took over “Nightly News” from Brian Williams under less than ideal circumstances. Instead of a grandly orchestrated rollout, Holt took over the anchor desk with little fanfare, as all of the drama focused on Williams’ fabrications and ultimate suspension. (Williams is now back on air, anchoring for MSNBC.) Holt has stayed away from doing any publicity ahead of the debates and stopped anchoring “Nightly News” last Tuesday to prepare for Monday night’s faceoff. Schieffer said moderators do best when they deliver short and simple questions that force the candidates to explain themselves. ""A key question for both these candidates is 'how are you going to do that?’ ” Schieffer said. “… How are you going to get the money to do it and how are you going to put together the coalition you would need if it’s a law to get something like that passed?"" The Clinton campaign hasn’t been directly in touch with Holt about its expectations for his handling of fact-checking duties on Trump – whom Clinton allies say routinely sprinkles his interviews and debate performances with assertions that journalists know aren’t true but are reluctant to challenge. But the campaign has made little secret of its insistence that Holt hold Trump accountable. ""For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage,” Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri said during a conference call with reporters on Friday. ""We do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time."" But the two former presidential debate moderators, Scheiffer and Lehrer, said that’s not necessarily how they would do it. Becoming the fact checker risks putting oneself in the position of Crowley, whom many Republicans believe damaged Romney’s performance unfairly. ""My thought is yes the moderators have to fact-check, but the first fact-check opporutnity should go to the candidate themselves,” Scheiffer said. “If candidate A said something and is blatantly wrong you want to give candidate B the first opportunity to fact check that."" If the second candidate doesn’t step in, Scheiffer said, the moderator has “the responsibility” to “state for the record what the facts are.” Jim Lehrer, the former PBS Newshour anchor who has moderated 12 presidential debates, said he also would strongly prefer to have the candidates fact-check each other than to step in himself. ""Usually the way you do that with simply the candidate there, you say 'would you agree with that, is that how you see it?’ ” Lehrer said. “In debates I tried to not do that [fact check] because I didn’t want to get in the way."" Both Schieffer and Lehrer said it’s almost guaranteed that Holt will be criticized by one side or the other, if not both. When Lehrer stayed mostly out of Obama and Romney’s way during the first presidential debate in 2012, he was criticized for not taking enough control. That same year, Schieffer was criticized for allowing the final debate to stray from foreign policy, the chosen topic for that debate. “This will be the ultimate ‘Rashomon’ test,” Lehrer said, referring to the famous movie in which an event is viewed differently by each character. “They always are, this one will just be a little more extreme.""

1590,"Perhaps I’m in the minority here, but I didn’t see a “clear winner” from the debate. Hillary Clinton was scripted and robotic as ever. Donald Trump was a more restrained version of himself. I feel like there were so many missed opportunities on his part. He should’ve brought up the Clinton Foundation. He should’ve slammed Hillary after she accused him of being a sexist. He should’ve hammered her on Benghazi. Still, there were no major gaffes, so that’s a relief. And honestly, I think Donald Trump will perform even better in the next debate.

1176,"Politico POLITICO's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FIGHT: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW -- If Congress doesn’t get its act together, the government shuts down next Friday night. And, perhaps predictably, trouble has sprouted up. The Senate is in the middle of a standoff, of sorts, over a bill to fund the government through December. AP’s Andy Taylor says Democrats are going to block the bill’s passage because it doesn’t include “$220 million to help Flint and other cities with lead emergencies replace pipes and take other steps to clean their water.” http://apne.ws/2cHPI2y Here is how a top Senate Republican and and a top Senate Democratic aide describe the standoff. --THE REPUBLICAN: “Senators wanted a clean CR [continuing resolution] with no poison pills. Senators on both sides of the aisle said that Zika was a crisis that couldn’t wait another day, that Zika was more important than any partisan riders. They wanted a bill that funded these Zika efforts, funded our veterans, addressed the opioid crisis and flood relief for places like Maryland, West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, and stayed within the budget caps. This 10-week clean CR does all of that -- it’s a fair proposal that contains exactly zero partisan poison-pill riders from either party. And it’s completed in time to finish our work before funding runs out at the end of the month -- as long as Democrats don’t filibuster. Again. Story Continued Below “Every rider that Democrats offered as an excuse for opposing the bill is gone. To now bring us to the brink of a government shutdown over a provision that’s not even in the bill, and that was funded elsewhere, would take obstruction to an obscene new level. Democrats will now have several days to hear from their constituents. And then they’ll have a chance on Tuesday to move forward on this bipartisan funding bill. We certainly hope they put our veterans, our troops, Zika victims and families torn apart by opioid abuse above petty politics.” --THE DEMOCRAT: “Senator McConnell made a huge miscalculation pulling out of negotiations and putting this partisan bill on the floor, and Republican Senators are going to have a tough time explaining why they want to give help to anywhere but Flint. This is quickly turning into the nightmare scenario that Republicans wanted to avoid -- they’re going to be four days away from a government shutdown over their insistence on providing aid everywhere but Flint, just six short weeks before the election.” --WHAT WE THINK: You think this is bad? Come on! It’s not really in anyone’s interest to shut down the government less than two months before Election Day. Nobody is predicting that this is going to lead to a shutdown. They have a week -- the government doesn’t shut down until next Friday -- and Congress rarely does anything until it absolutely has to. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX Happy Friday!

I did not see that in the video.’ But Putney said the ‘totality’ of the evidence supports the police conclusion that officers confronting Scott faced an imminent, deadly threat. Putney said the videos would not be released because, among other reasons, it might infringe upon a parallel state investigation into the shooting.” http://bit.ly/2cWATui … Charlotte Observer A1 http://politi.co/2cLXfPU -- NYT’s Richard Fausset and Alan Blinder in Charlotte on A1: “Fatal Shooting by Police Shakes Charlotte’s Self-Image”: “This has always been a place that has prided itself on order, consensus and a can-do corporate mentality that turned a locale with no real geographic reason to exist into one of the hemisphere’s financial dynamos. It has also gained a reputation for racial amity, from its nationally recognized commitment to busing and integrated schools in the 1970s and ’80s, to the election of Harvey Gantt in 1983 as one of the South’s first prominent black mayors. But the fatal police shooting on Tuesday of a black resident, Keith Lamont Scott, and the protests that have followed are among numerous bumps and jolts that have shaken Charlotte’s sense of itself recently as it emerged from a successful small city to a more complicated larger one.” http://nyti.ms/2d5pusP OBAMA on the violent protests in Charlotte: “The way we change the system requires to be able to reach out and engage the broader American community and that requires being peaceful, that requires being thoughtful about what are the specific reforms you’re looking for,” in an interview with ABC “Good Morning America” co-anchor Robin Roberts. “[The] overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way … Every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way … I think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind.” http://abcn.ws/2cKSdDC DEPT OF DARK ARTS -- “Key lawmakers accuse Russia of campaign to disrupt U.S. election,” by WaPo’s Greg Miller: “Two senior Democratic lawmakers with access to classified intelligence on Thursday accused Russia of ‘making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,’ a charge that appeared aimed at putting pressure on the Obama administration to confront Moscow. The jointly issued statement from Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam B. Schiff — Californians who are the ranking Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committees, respectively — described recent cyber penetrations of the [DNC] and other U.S. political entities as intrusions that were likely directed by Russian President Vladi­mir Putin. ‘At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes,’ the statement said. ‘We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government.’” http://wapo.st/2cHYygI --“White House Contractor’s Leaked Email Reveals Secret Service Plans, Michelle Obama Passport” – NBC News: http://nbcnews.to/2deDSxT SILICON VALLEY WATCH -- “Yahoo Says Information on at Least 500 Million User Accounts Was Stolen,” by WSJ’s Robert McMillan: “Yahoo Inc. is blaming ‘state-sponsored’ hackers for what may be the largest-ever theft of personal user data.

That announcement follows skittish Democrats chastising the campaign in a Washington Post report for starting a concerted advertising campaign later than President Obama did in his 2012 race. ‘We will have more to say soon, but the campaign will continue to advertise on Spanish TV and radio, as well as targeting Latino households through TV in English until election day,’ a Clinton aide told BuzzFeed News.” http://bzfd.it/2cW326C WHAT BROOKLYN IS READING -- “Inside Hillary Clinton's debate prep,” by Annie Karni and Glenn Thrush: “No secret on the Clinton campaign has been more closely guarded than the identity of the person who is impersonating Trump in the closed-door sessions staged at Clinton's Manhattan office and at her home in Chappaqua.

The increase in estate and gift taxes and other new items Mrs. Clinton detailed Thursday follow two ideas central to her campaign. First, she pairs proposed spending increases and tax cuts with tax increases to prevent projected budget deficits from growing. And she targets tax increases at the top of the income and wealth scale. “The latest proposals would generate $260 billion over the next decade, enough to pay for her plans to simplify small-business taxes and expand the child tax credit, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates fiscal restraint. In all, Mrs. Clinton would raise taxes by about $1.5 trillion over the next decade to pay for expanded education assistance, paid family leave and other programs.

Kelly Ayotte campaign for re-election in New Hampshire, you wouldn’t always know she’s a Republican. She highlights her support for a plan by President Barack Obama’s administration to cut carbon emissions that Republicans loathe, and she talks up bipartisanship, at times not even mentioning her own party. Although she’s in line with the GOP in cutting federal funds for Planned Parenthood, Ayotte focuses her women’s health message on increasing access to over-the-counter birth control and mammograms. Running in 5Ks and helping take out trash at a town dump, Ayotte tries to project an image of an average mom rather than the ideologue that Democratic challenger Gov. Maggie Hassan paints her as. ‘I don’t assume one party has all the answers,’ Ayotte declares in a television ad that aired last month.” http://apne.ws/2d55wA6 FOR YOUR RADAR -- MSNBC “Morning Joe” exclusive interview with Turkish President Recep Erdoğan debuting this morning. From Ayman Mohyeldin’s interview: “No political figure has the luxury of embracing a negative attitude towards the followers of a certain faith. And it should not be exercised for the sake of political advantage or political competitiveness. I’ve been the prime minister of all beliefs and all faiths and ethnicities in my country.” On the Syrian cease-fire: “Well unfortunately, it is a stillborn baby.” ... On the aid convoy attack: “The killer responsible for that attack is Assad’s regime itself.

Any Snapchat user in the U.S. who is 18 and older and therefore eligible to vote can see the video ads between Snapchat Stories and Discover that direct to a voter registration mobile webpage within the app that’s powered by TurboVote. The campaign began on Sept. 15 and lasts until Oct. 7.” http://on.mash.to/2d27HRd PER SNAPCHAT – The PSA campaign is featuring “celebrity partners like Jared Leto and Jimmy Fallon. ... On any given day, Snapchat reaches more than 40 percent of all 18-34 year olds in the US, making it a particularly important platform for both candidates.” -- “Facebook is using its News Feed to steer people on its platform to register for the November election. Today, the tech company launched posts which run through Monday to remind people across the country to register through vote.usa.gov. After completing their registration, people can let their friends on Facebook know that they are registered and encourage them to register too. Facebook’s registration reminders add to its suite of voter features, which has included Election Day reminders since 2008. The reminders will go out to those on the social network who are 18 and up, which with its broad popularity could mean significant spikes in registration nationwide.” JOSH EARNEST on a special edition of GQ’s “The Closer with Keith Olbermann”: “The success that our country has enjoyed over the last seven-and-a-half years didn’t happen by accident. Our economic recovery was led by the success of the private sector, there’s no argument about that. But those successes would not have been possible without smart government policies ... I don’t want to downplay the stakes in the election. The President has spoken to this quite directly himself. Democracy is on the ballot. Hope is on the ballot.

The co-founder and CEO of Crowdpac, a nonpartisan political crowdfunding startup that aims help citizens engage in politics through data and online tools, is trying to shake up the cottage industry of ballot measures. The group is releasing a new tool that allows users to contribute money to specific ballot measures on issues like gun control, raising the minimum wage, charter schools and legalizing marijuana in multiple states. http://bit.ly/2cQJD9I “We’re taking something that is a really big feature of politics and the way issues are handled at the state level and right across the country, which is ballot measures, which is often the way important changes on issues that people care about actually happen, and we’re trying to demystify that process and make it easier for people to understand what’s going on and participate directly,” Hilton said. Change in politics happens by working within the system: “There has been this slightly naïve and perhaps arrogant view that technology can completely reinvent the political system and the way that government and politics works, which is ridiculous … The challenge is to get people involved in the system we have.” Ballot measures are more reliable than candidates: “A lot of people are driven by an interest by one particular issue or a small number of specific issues rather than a candidate or a party or something broader … The fact is on certain issues it is through ballot measures that they are advanced, or not advanced depending on whether the ballot measure is passed.” Trump, Sanders are just the beginning: “[There’s] a real sense of a grassroots desire to run for office and to do it without the party machines. We’re getting a lot of incoming requests actually aiming for the next cycle — whether that’s local council or state legislature… I definitely feel you could see in the next cycle a really big increase in the number of challengers to the establishment candidates running in primaries at all levels, particularly state and local.” SPOTTED: Dave Grohl last night at Le Diplomate.

452,"WashingtonSince we last updated the CNN battleground map, Donald Trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.  And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. Why two congressional districts could be key to this election With four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. What's changed? -- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican"" -- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican"" -- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" -- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground"" Explore the map and make your choices Road to 270: Electoral College map Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. The state of play Donald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.  That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.  Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.  Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column.  There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump. It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall. Ohio poised to go down to the line on Election Day That's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio. Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.

The charity run in New Jersey was cancelled after an explosion took place in Seaside Park, New Jersey. The explosion took place in a garbage can which is where two unexploded pipe bombs were later found. Authorities have told residents to stay inside their homes and away from the area the race was supposed to take place. Unfortunately, the explosion took place at 9:35 A.M. on Saturday morning, just yesterday. It was on the corner of D Street and Ocean Avenue right before the Seaside Park Semper Five 5K Charity Run. Luckily, nobody was injured or hurt and no structures had serious damage. Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com A Facebook post on the explosion states, “Out of extreme precaution, this year’s Seaside Semper Five has been canceled due to an unidentified suspicious backpack found at the race site. The safety and security of our participants, spectators, staff and volunteers is of utmost importance. We’d like to thank the Seaside Park Police Department, all the first responders and emergency personnel for their quick action. Further details will be posted when available. Thank you for your understanding.” Apparently, Fox News is the only outlet interested in getting the truth out there.  Another incident also took place in Minnesota as well. However, all three incidents do not appear to be connected as the authorities have said. They do appear to have been premeditated and planned but it is unknown who the culprit is, their motives or why they chose the areas they did. Officials have also noted that as of now their appears to be no indication this is an act of terrorism.

260,"Atlanta (CNN)Long before New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ran for president, and later transformed into one of Republican nominee Donald Trump's main supporters on the 2016 campaign trail, he was mired in a political scandal that left its mark on his career: Bridgegate. It's been a few years since the brouhaha over the George Washington Bridge's lane closures rocked the Christie administration. Now, after three years of federal investigations, a couple of indictments and jury selection, the trial of a former aide of New Jersey's governor and one of his longtime political allies will begin this morning in federal court. Though Christie himself has not faced any charges related to this incident -- he's denied all involvement from the onset -- he's expected to remain a key figure in the trial, unable to fully escape scrutiny from a controversy that's overshadowed his second and final term as governor. On Monday, prosecutors said Christie knew of the road closures while they were happening. The allegations came during opening arguments in the case involving Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff. In case you forget how Bridgegate all went down -- and what's at stake in the coming weeks -- here's an explanation of how we got to this point. So, what's Bridgegate again? In November 2013, Christie won re-election to his second and final gubernatorial term (he's term limited), cruising to a decisive victory fueled in part by his strong showing of leadership in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Despite his popularity at the time, not everyone endorsed the Republican, who needed bipartisan backing in a blue state. Mark Sokolich, the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, was among the politicians who didn't support the incumbent governor. The following September, on the first day of the school year, Port Authority officials abruptly shut down some of the traffic lanes on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, drawing the ire of motorists. Initially, Christie's administration characterized the closures as a part of a traffic study. Later on, though, Port Authority officials testified that no such study ever happened. One month before the lane closure, with Christie's re-election campaign in full swing, and Kelly texted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and a political ally of Christie: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. The messages, contrary to the Christie administration's spin that chalked it up to ineffective bureaucracy, offered evidence that the closures were an act of political vengeance, according to federal prosecutors. ""They agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution,"" US Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman said in May 2015. Who was charged in Bridgegate? Bill Baroni, deputy executive director of the Port Authority and Kelly were indicted on numerous conspiracy and fraud charges in May 2015. Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation. The Bridgegate charges stem from a series of damning emails and texts made public in January 2014. In response to the charges, Kelly chalked up her correspondence with Wildstein to ""sarcasm and humor."" Then, she lambasted Wildstein for lying about her involvement in order to get himself a plea deal. What about Christie? Those facing charges had clear and direct ties to Christie. However, the governor has not faced charges and he has maintained he had no knowledge of the lane closures, denying any wrongdoing. Shortly after the texts surfaced, Christie fired Kelly, noting that he felt ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by the ""abject stupidity"" of her actions. Two months after those emails went public, lawyers retained by Christie's office released a Bridgegate report that exonerated Christie. ""It's a search for the truth and we believe we have gotten to the truth,"" former federal prosecutor Randy Mastro, whose law firm produced the Bridgegate report, told NJ.com in 2014 upon its release. ""What we found was Gov. Christie had no involvement in the decision to close these lanes, and no prior knowledge of it."" Will the governor testify at the Bridgegate trial? It remains to be seen whether Christie will be subpoenaed. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday, the governor said he would have ""no problem"" testifying if called upon. However, he didn't think he would be called he has ""no knowledge of this incident at all."" ""Of course, I will,"" Christie told CNN. ""I've been more open about this than anybody in public life. I've been investigated by three public entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement."" it's unclear what the developments from Monday's court date, and prosecutors saying that Christie was aware of Bridgecate, means for the possibility that the governor will testify. Even if Christie doesn't take the witness stand, the governor will likely remain front and center in the federal trial. Last month, a former Christie staffer, who worked underneath Kelly, claimed that he ""flat out lied"" about his staff's involvement in Bridgegate during a December 2013 news conference. What's at stake for the defendants? If a jury finds Baroni and Kelly guilty, they each could face prison time for their involvement in Bridgegate. Fishman, the federal prosecutor in the case, told The New York Times at the time of the indictment that Baroni and Kelly each face a maximum sentence of 86 years. It was more likely that Baroni and Kelly would receive up to three years behind bars if convicted, Fishman added. Of course, they could also leave the court as free people, should a jury clear them of all charges. As for Christie, who Trump has said would head his transition team, the Bridgegate trial has the potential to drag him through the mud — if not in a court facing a trial before his peers, then in the court of public opinion.

1211,"Donald Trump’s son will headline a fundraiser for a Trump super PAC next week, a move that comes amid ongoing confusion in the Republican donor world about which pro-Trump group to support. Donald Trump Jr. is slated to attend a New York City fundraiser on Thursday for Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC that’s being chaired by Florida Gov. Rick Scott. Alex Castellanos, a veteran Republican strategist, is also helping to steer the group. Story Continued Below An invitation to the fundraiser lists a handful of hosts including former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, Wall Street investor Anthony Scaramucci, and investor Howard Lorber. It’s not the first time the younger Trump has boosted Rebuilding America Now. On Monday, he appeared at another event for the group. Donald Trump Jr. spoke optimistically about his father’s campaign, arguing that he was demonstrating strength in even traditionally Democratic areas, according to one attendee. The Thursday event comes as many Republican donors continue to grapple with which Trump super PAC to give to. Another group, Great America PAC, recently hosted a fundraiser in Trump Tower that was attended by another Trump son, Eric. And this week, it was revealed that two of the Republican Party’s biggest donors, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, would contribute to a third anti-Hillary Clinton group, Future45. With many Republican donors keeping their distance from Trump, none of the pro-Trump super PACs have raised anywhere near as much money as the pro-Hillary Clinton Priorities USA.

(I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his… Posted by Robert Reich on Monday, September 19, 2016 The post begins with Reich patronizing a local coffee shop, and encountering a man with a Trump bumper sticker on his car. When Reich asked the man if he was a Donald Trump supporter, the man defensively responded in the affirmative. Rather than attempting to preach to the Trump supporter, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor engagefd him in dialogue and asked him why he was supporting the GOP nominee. After the man told Reich he was voting for Trump due to his business acumen, Reich reminded him that Trump inherited most of his wealth, and invested it poorly. The man was silent by the time Reich told him about Trump’s real estate empire being largely built on the backs of taxpayers with nearly $900 million in public dollars. Reich’s account of the conversation is a perfect example of how to politely plant seeds of doubt in the minds of Trump’s supporters in the last 50 days before the general election: “I know he’s a little bit much,” said the Trump supporter. “But he’s a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president.” “How do you know he’s a successful businessman?” I asked. “Because he’s made a fortune.” “Has he really?” I asked. “Of course. Forbes magazine says he’s worth four and a half billion.” “That doesn’t mean he’s been a success,” I said. “In my book it does,” said the Trump supporter. “You know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,” I said. “Most of that was from his father.” “That just proves my point,” said the Trump supporter. “He turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man.” “But if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, he’d be worth twelve billion today,” I said. The Trump supporter went silent. “And he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in New York alone,” I said. More silence. “He’s not a businessman,” I said. “He’s a con man. “Hope you enjoy your coffee.” Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will meet for their first presidential debate next Monday.        ",0,1,0
865,"Federal prosecutors began the first “Bridgegate” criminal trial by leveling their biggest accusations at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, even though his two main deputies are the ones on trial this week. At least one known death was attributed to Bridgegate by the news media. Even though Christie isn’t a defendant in today’s court action, the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation, as NJ.com reported: U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna, describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee beginning on Sept. 9, 2013, said David Wildstein,  a former Port Authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year, will admit he was the one who came up with that idea. The prosecutor added that Wildstein will testify he and Baroni told Christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in Fort Lee during a Sept. 11 commemoration Manhattan. “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish Mayor Sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned. This case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of Fort Lee,” said Khanna. Last year, Trump publicly accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate, but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one, the two Republicans have become nearly inseparable, no doubt brought together over a mutual love of McDonald’s. Federal prosecutors are seeking to convict Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was Governor Christie’s deputy chief of staff.  The only thing that the defense, prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon, is that the New Jersey Republican knew about his subordinates’ political retribution against a local mayor. In fact, defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the George Washington Bridge connecting Fort Lee to New York City now known as BridgeGate had to be covered up to protect Christie’s now tarnished political career, because even back in 2013 he was plotting a Presidential campaign: Defense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie, a Republican, and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governor’s political aspirations — saying their clients were “thrown under the presidential bus,” as one lawyer argued on Monday. But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie. And it directly contradicts the governor’s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed, paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee, N.J. As usual, the New York Times understates the forcefulness of Chris Christie’s prior defense of his blatant lies in BridgeGate. We uncovered this extraordinary video where the New Jersey Republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything. For years, Christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of New York and New Jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible Republican administration. From the sound of federal prosecutors, it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their grasp to serve Christie notice, and he’s the most likely final target of this prosecution.

69,"An anti-Donald Trump super PAC is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this Monday at Hofstra University in New York. The group, the Not Who We Are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. A new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to Trump's message.     “I don’t think you can have a racist bigot as president,” one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus. Another chimes in, “He makes me terrified.” And a third simply says, “I don’t want him on campus.” The Not Who We Are campaign plans to run the ad on Twitter and Facebook ahead of and during Monday’s debate.   “Since the Donald himself is coming to campus, these Hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as Americans and not who they are as part of the Hofstra community,” Not Who We Are’s campaign manager Josh Hendler said in a statement. Hendler’s group bills itself as a venue for “community members and leaders across the country” to “organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against” Trump by writing open letters. “We’ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,” the group’s website says. The site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers. One recent letter, written by Hofstra student Rob Bielunas, reads in part: ""As a community, Hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas Mr. Trump has used to get where he is today. His hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the Hofstra community, stand up against Donald J Trump’s run for president.""",1,0,0

1252,"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Donald Trump is going to be clearer and more precise when he steps up to the debate podium Monday night, but beyond that “he’s basically going to be Donald Trump.” “My advice to him, I think Donald Trump has done best since Donald Trump has been just let loose to be Donald Trump,” the frequent Trump surrogate said on “Fox and Friends” Monday morning. “There's a lot of discussion of, you know, how things should be scripted and I think what we've all found that are working with him now is you let him be himself, this man is an extraordinary political thinker himself and a great communicator.” Story Continued Below But like other Republicans making the rounds on TV news Monday morning, Giuliani was quick to set a higher bar for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who the former mayor said has a decided advantage over Trump. Giuliani said the Manhattan billionaire will have to work to counter the former secretary of state’s experience in government and policy expertise on the debate stage. “She has, obviously, policy knowledge I don't have. She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,” Giuliani said of Clinton. “So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be -- he's just going to be like you see him on, when he comes here, and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.” Giuliani dismissed concerns about Trump’s non-traditional approach to debate preparation, which has eschewed the mock debates that Clinton has used to ready herself. Giuliani said Trump has studied tapes of Clinton’s past debate performances as well as his own and likened the preparation to that of a boxer, suggesting that “you get the person ready the way they want to get ready.” One issue that Giuliani said Trump is not worried about coming up at the debate is the issue of his often inaccuracy-laden campaign rhetoric. Multiple media outlets, including POLITICO, have discovered numerous lies and half-truths in fact-checking Trump’s remarks, but the former New York mayor said the GOP nominee stacks up well against Clinton when it comes to truthfulness. “I can't imagine that probably the biggest liar that ever ran for president of the United States is going to bring up lies,” he said. “I mean, this is the woman who’s lied maybe 15 different times about Benghazi and told three different stories. So I think if she wants to get to the area of lying, she's lied about things related to national security. That’s a topic we would love.”",1,0,0

904,"A police officer in Louisiana fighting murder charges in the death of a 6-year-old boy with autism is pleading self-defense, saying he feared for his life. In late 2015, Norris Greenhouse, Jr., 24, and Lt. Derrick Stafford, 32, of the Marksville, Louisiana police department, opened fire on Christopher Few’s car while his young son, Jeremy Mardis, was strapped in the front seat. While Few survived the injuries sustained from the gunshots, Mardis was killed at the scene. Because Few was backing his car toward the officers, attorneys representing Stafford say his indictments for second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder should be dropped as he was in fear for his life. “A review of the indictment by the court would show that the state does not state any allegations of fact that would satisfy the essential element of specific intent for the offenses charged whereby trier of fact could support a conviction,” Stafford’s attorneys wrote to the court. In body camera video of the shooting, which has still not been publicly released after nearly a year, prosecutors with the Louisiana Attorney General’s office say Greenhouse and Stafford fired on Few’s car from a “safe distance,” even while Few had his hands in the air in a plea to stop the officers from firing on his vehicle. This isn’t Stafford’s first brush with criminal charges. In 2011, he was charged with raping two women in Rapides Parish — an 18-year-old girl, and a 16-year-old girl on her birthday. The charges were dropped in 2012. Both Stafford and Greenhouse are facing separate trials for their charges. Stafford will stand trial on November 28, and Greenhouse’s trial is scheduled for March 2017. Louisiana state district judge William Bennett will hear Stafford’s argument to quash the indictment next Wednesday.        ",0,1,0

82,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs. The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers. Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:        Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface. When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting. Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.” He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.  Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business. “Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker. Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics. “For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.  Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim. “And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said. Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.” Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.” “Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said. Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”  Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.” Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?” Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“ Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""    Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns. “I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general. Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said. “I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns? “Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.  Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years. At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate. Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015. “Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”    Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.” Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.  Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate. “Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said. Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.” “They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal. Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.  Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started. “I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.” Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.” The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?"" Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.” Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”  Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.” ""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.” Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down. ""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said. She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women: ""One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,” Clinton said. ""But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.”",1,0,0
174,"The question of what the role of a moderator is in a presidential debate has taken on a whole new significance during this election because Donald Trump, more so than any candidate in American history, has shown a willingness to lie, boldly and without apology, when he feels it suits him. His ability to say, with a straight face, obvious lies that a typical human would find impossible due to a profound sense of shame make his appearance on the debate stage a singular moment in history. Matt Lauer recently held what was billed as the “preview” of the debates with a one-on-one sit down with both candidates for an extended question-and-answer session. While Lauer grilled Clinton on her voting record and on (*sigh*) the emails, when it came time to question Trump he turned into a doormat. Critics slammed the embarrassing way Lauer allowed Trump to lie to his face without any pushback. In one particularly blatant example, Trump falsely claimed that he had been opposed to the Iraq War from the very beginning, an easily debunked lie that Lauer was surely aware of. The debates, many Americans hoped, would be different. If Trump chooses to openly lie to voters during the events, moderators should be expected to jump in and clarify the falsehoods. Needless to say, the person making the most noise about this change of plans is…Donald Trump. In an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed there would be people “watching” for moderators to fact check him and would react badly if he wasn’t allowed to say whatever he wanted. First, Trump slammed Candy Crawley, who famously corrected Mitt Romney during a debate with President Obama. It has often been seen as a pivotal moment in that debate and the real-time fact check threw Romney off of his game for the rest of the night. Trump would prefer he and Clinton get a chance to fight it out without interference, even if what he is saying are lies. You know, I think there’s a lot of pressure on [first debate moderator Lester Holt]. I think Lester’s a very good person, a very good man. I think there’s a lot of pressure on him. You know, when I had the town hall, last week with Hillary, I did well, and I had tough questions. But the polls all had her taking a drubbing….They went after Matt Lauer, and I’ve never seen anything like it….That’s what they’re doing with Lester Holt…and a lot of people are watching to see whether he succumbs to that pressure. The difference between Trump’s camp and Clinton’s couldn’t be more apparent here. While Democrats are demanding the truth be the focal point of the night, conservatives – including Trump himself – are telling moderators that they should not worry about what is a lie and what isn’t. As the Washington Post’s Greg Sergent noted: In other words, one side wants the moderators to hold the candidates accountable, and the other doesn’t. We can argue endlessly over whether those in the former camp are trying to game the debates so that Trump faces tougher questioning than Clinton does. But the bottom line is that, given that it is simply true that Trump lies a lot more frequently, audaciously, and egregiously than Clinton does, and that it took many months before this was widely acknowledged in the press, most Clinton supporters would probably be just fine with equivalent treatment of both of their assertions at the debate, and if they aren’t, they should be. Republicans want Trump to lie. Democrats simply want both sides to tell the truth. It’s rare in politics to find such a clear contrast.

Machado, who represented Venezuela in Trump's 1996 ""Miss Universe"" competition said that Trump called her ""Miss Housekeeping"" and ""Miss Piggy"" when she gained weight after winning the beauty pageant. ""I know what I left with him and he knows, too. And he was really aggressive. He was really rude. He was a bad person with me,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on ""AC360."" ""That is the story that I need to share with my community. We cannot accept no more insults for my Latin community. No more insults for the women. I know very well Mr. Trump and I can see the same person that I met 20 years ago."" At the presidential debate on Monday, Clinton referenced Machado to make a bigger point to Trump about his public treatment of women -- which has become a key campaign issue that hits on his vulnerabilities with both Hispanics and women. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton had said.

""There are reports that Trump surrogates tonight have been referencing and been pointing to ... about an incident in 1998 in Venezuela where you were accused of driving a getaway car from a murder scene. You were never charged with this. The judge in the case also said you threatened to kill him after he indicted your boyfriend for the attempted murder. I just want to give you a chance to respond these reports,"" Cooper said. Machado responded: ""He can say whatever he wants to say. I don't care. You know, I have my past, of course everybody has a past. And I'm no saint girl. But that is not the point now ... (Trump) was really rude with me, he tried to destroy my self esteem. And now I'm a voice in the Latin community. I'm in a great moment in my life and I have a very clear life. And I can show my taxes.""

1032,"Donald Trump’s campaign, hoping to counter Hillary Clinton’s air assault, is in talks with veteran GOP ad maker Rex Elsass, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. Elsass, according to one of the sources, met with Trump officials in New York City last week. Story Continued Below Elsass has deep connections to the Trump campaign. He previously served as a top strategist to vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, and in 2012 he worked with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who came under widespread criticism after making controversial remarks about rape. Elsass is a partner at Strategy Group for Media, a firm that has also counted Jim Murphy, Trump’s national political director, as an employee. Trump’s advertising campaign has been led by Jamestown, a prominent political consulting firm with an anti-establishment edge. Two Jamestown employees, Jason Miller and Larry Weitzner, have taken senior roles in the campaign. Also helping to lead the Trump ad effort is Rick Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who assisted the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004. Discussions about bringing aboard Elsass come as Trump is getting walloped on the airwaves. On Sept. 12, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, detailed in an email to Trump campaign officials how Clinton was outspending the Republican nominee on TV by an astonishing seven-to-one margin. With polling in many battlegrounds suggesting the race is tight, many Republican strategists are concerned that Trump’s lack of commercial spending could pose problems as the contest enters its final seven weeks. The Ohio-based GOP operative has a long history in Republican politics, having worked for a number of presidential candidates over the years. During this year’s primary season, Elsass advised Rand Paul and, following Paul’s departure from the race, John Kasich. In 2012, he worked for Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich. Neither Elsass nor a Trump spokesperson responded to requests for comment.",1,0,0

1456,"One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state. Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.” “Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.” Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks. These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster. “That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States. Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture. Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle. “She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said. This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

An explosion on Saturday night in what is known as New York’s “Chelsea neighborhood” left over 29 people injured. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the explosion was definitely intentional, but as of now they do not believe it to be a specific terrorist threat. At a late night news conference after the explosion Blasio spoke saying that they are at full alert now. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization. We believe at this point in time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert…Whatever the cause, New Yorkers will not be intimidated, they will not let anyone change who we are…”  The explosion on Saturday night wasn’t the only concern either. Authorities and examiners went searching the area on Sunday and found another explosive near the area of the explosion on Saturday night. A random pressure cooker was found about four blocks away from the site that the bomb went off. The police department tweeted around 2:30am stating that the device had been safely removed. “The suspicious device on West 27 Street in Chelsea has been safely removed by the NYPD Bomb Squad…”  New York Police Commissioner James O’Neill said that the explosion wasn’t a natural gas explosion but they also don’t have any other leads on the cause of the explosion either. They are treating the area as a crime scene in hopes to protect residents from harm. “The investigation is active and at this time an extensive search is being conducted.

He has pictures of himself just papering the whole office. And then his desk is all full of magazines where he is on the cover...the whole office is like this pure odyssey through his ego.” Speaking on ABC’s Powerhouse Politics Podcast, Dowd said she wondered why he would want to become a politician. “I asked him once, ‘Why are you running.’ It didn’t seem to me a wise decision to trade in a perfectly good reputation as this kind of fun huckster for a reputation as a scary Hitler. And I said, ‘Why couldn’t you run more like the person you were in New York all those years?'"" she recalled. ""He had a cartoonish reputation like a Batman character or villain but not hatred."" Dowd, author of the new book, ""The Year of Voting Dangerously, the Derangement of American Politics,"" said she was disappointed by Trump’s recent tweet calling her ""wacky"" and a ""neurotic dope."" ""I felt like he hadn’t put much effort into giving me a good nickname. He calls all women reporters that he doesn’t like 'wacky and neurotic,'"" she said. ""I was hoping I would have something more distinctive like Pocahontas or Sleepy Eyes, which he uses for Chuck Todd.

469,"(CNN)At a recent campaign event, Hillary Clinton climbed on a box to address a room packed with young people. But instead of facing the Democratic presidential nominee, the audience turned their backs on her en masse. Further evidence of Clinton's challenge in winning over millennials? No. As it turned out, the Orlando, Florida, crowd wasn't being disrespectful. With their smartphones and cameras held high, they were snapping selfies -- trying to capture a historic moment by sharing a photo frame with the presidential candidate. Clinton's full-time photographer, Barbara Kinney, snapped a photo of the scene, which apparently happened after Clinton invited the crowd to turn around and snap a group selfie. Kinney wasn't expecting her photo to get so much attention, but since designer and Clinton supporter Victor Ng posted it Sunday to Twitter, it's been shared more than 19,000 times. The image isn't the only one to show our recent obsession with selfies. Who can forget the moment when Ellen DeGeneres' selfie at the Oscars in 2014 nearly crashed the Internet? Or when Queen Elizabeth II accidentally photobombed a selfie taken at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow? And remember the iconic selfie taken of the Pope inside St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican in 2013? The pontiff had a private audience with 500 youths from the Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio. And what of the controversy surrounding the selfie of the endangered monkey with the cheeky grin?

That bombast could prompt millions of Americans to watch the two candidates square off and could end up benefiting Clinton, she said. Story Continued Below “The gift of the debate for us and the gift of running against somebody as controversial as Trump is the interest in the debate, so there’s 100 million people watching,” Palmieri told Chuck Todd on MSNBC’s “MTP Daily.” “It's 100 million people we’re going to be in front of. It's more than the convention. It is a gift that no other presidential candidate has gotten.” “It's bigger than most debates because of that audience. And so we see that as a gift.

Trump pointed to how Israel used profiling and ""done an unbelievable job."" Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but It's illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status.

It’s a counterintuitive political strategy: Raising expectations ahead of what may be the most-watched debate in history is a risky proposition for both sides when the race is so tight. In 2012, President Barack Obama gave a rusty performance in his first debate that jolted the race and alarmed Democrats nationwide. The Virginia senator himself acknowledged that things had gotten closer than many Democrats had hoped, repeatedly calling Clinton’s lead “narrow.” But he suggested that Monday night could change all that. “You’re going to see him have to get into specifics and Hillary too. But we’re going to see who can answer the specific questions. I mean Donald Trump hasn’t answered a basic question that’s been asked of presidential candidates: show us your tax returns,” Kaine said. “Donald Trump’s had problems with the specifics so far, tomorrow night we’re going to see: Can he give some specifics?” Kaine barely mentioned Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate, even though the two will debate in just over a week.

805,"Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun. Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason. It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted? Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police. Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police. That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.  Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed. If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up. Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses. Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America. They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white. They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

1595,"Conservatives are so fed up with hearing about these two Hollywood stars’ marital problems and I’m right there in that group. There is nothing more boring than people who thrive on gossip and what is going wrong in another person’s life. That being said, I’m sure a lot of you are thinking, “Okay, but if she feels that way then why is she writing this story?” The answer to that is quite simple, I agree with Jennifer Aniston’s boyfriend, who was asked about the split up.  No doubt the media was looking for an answer to the effect of, “She’s grinning ear-to-ear and licking her chops.” The problem with that is, Justin Theroux refused to indulge them with a juicy, scandalous answer. It’s no secret that most people expect Aniston to be pleased that the man who cheated on her is splitting from the woman with whom he had the fling. There has to be at least a deep, dark pleasure, right? If there is, Theroux isn’t saying. What he did say is something that I think everyone can agree with, especially men and women who have endured divorce and children of divorce. “As a child of divorce, all I can say is that’s terrible news for those children, and that’s all you can really say,” the 45-year-old star said. “It’s boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time. That’s horrible.” You’ll find anyone who is hard-pressed to disagree that divorce isn’t easy on the family unit, even if it is what’s best in the long-run. The first thing I thought when I heard that they were splitting up was, “Oh no, those poor babies.” Anyone who has felt the effects of divorce was probably thinking the same thing. Yes, their relationship was a relatively long one, but that doesn’t mean it was perfect. I just hope they do whatever it takes to make sure those children receive the best of them both and that the babies don’t ever feel like it is their fault that their parents decided to get a divorce. No child should EVER have to feel like they are the reason that their parents didn’t stay married. ",0,0,1

116,"The whole world is talking about Donald Trump, over which he is no doubt preening because any attention is good attention as long as itâs focused entirely on him. But besides the obvious problems with this, thereâs one tradition thatâs very important among international leaders and diplomats. Trump is getting dangerously close to destroying it. The tradition is this: You donât trash-talk a foreign countryâs political candidates. That might seem silly. It might seem trivial. Itâs not. This is a very old tradition that was actually turned into policy at the 1961 Vienna Convention. While different countries interpret âThou shalt not interfere in foreign countriesâ electionsâ differently, most are careful to keep their mouths shut, at least publicly. Even in 2004, when the whole world hated George W. Bush for the fiasco that was Iraq, foreign diplomats and leaders mostly kept quiet. Not so now. Trump is testing everyoneâs patience, and many find that they just canât keep it to themselves: âIf you represent one of these countries that has been insulted or attacked, you tend to react. We are very passionate, and our blood is pretty hot. But we have to play it cool and understand that this is a campaign, and an election, and that we are diplomats.â This week, thousands of foreign diplomats are gathering in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly. Trump has insulted a great many of them in one way or another. What the Latin-American diplomat said to is true around the world: âAdding to the complications is that U.S. elections are increasingly followed intensely by people overseas, whether itâs via Facebook or CNN International. So when a U.S. presidential candidate slams a foreign country as Trump has so often (with Mexico, Japan, China, members of NATO, and on and on) representatives of those countries feel unusual domestic pressure to respond.â Wars of words could easily escalate into more serious wars with Trump. Heâs proven that with his threats against both Ted Cruz and John Kasich for the 2018 midterms â he canât let a slight go. As another example of how he goes after everyone who pisses him off: Heâs busy trash-talking a Scottish whiskey company for daring to give an award to a neighbor of his who criticizes his golf course. In retaliation, heâs banned every brand of whiskey from William Grant & Sons for that affront, because really, how dare they? He should have more important things to worry about than petty personal slights, but theyâre actually the centerpiece of his whole existence. When foreign leaders wonât play ball his way, and go on record with nothing but what he thinks are insults, whatâs he going to do? Two guesses what heâll do, but youâll only need one. He hasnât even been elected yet and foreign leaders and diplomats are openly attacking him. Some of these people probably held their tongues when George W. was running for re-election, however hard that might have been. This would be hilarious if it wasnât so frightening. ",0,1,0

Clinton said that “we’re going to enforce the trade deals we have and we’re going to hold people accountable.” She continued by saying that the country “increased global exports 40 percent” during her time as Secretary of State. “You go to new England, Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacturing is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever,” Trump shot back. “Donald, you may live in your own reality but that is not the facts,” Clinton said to Trump.",1,0,0
1028,"Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence called the outrage surrounding a social media post from his running mate’s son “remarkable,” especially when compared to Hillary Clinton’s proposals on immigration and national security. Donald Trump Jr. posted an image to Twitter on Monday night with a bowl of Skittles and the message “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you that just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That’s our Syrian refugee problem.” Along with the image, Trump Jr. wrote “This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016.” Story Continued Below The message from the son of the Republican presidential nominee almost immediately drew criticisms of racism. The Skittles metaphor is similar to one that white supremacists have used in the past, but Pence dismissed the criticism in an interview Tuesday with MSNBC’s Kelly O’Donnell. “It is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr. when Hillary Clinton is calling for a 550 percent increase in the Syrian refugee program,” Pence said. “All the while our FBI and public safety officials tell us we can't know for sure who those people are coming into this country.” Trump campaign senior communications adviser Jason Miller echoed that comparison in a statement Tuesday afternoon, calling Trump Jr. ""a tremendous asset to the campaign."" ""America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton's planned 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk,"" Miller's statement read. ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us.""",1,0,0
554,"I was watching a local news show about a business called “Out of the Closet.” They are a series of thrift stores to benefit AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise, but you can get free HIV and STD tests.  I found this rather curious. Why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “Out of the Closet” be offering HIV and STD tests? What is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases?  I don’t need to be tested for HIV and STDs. The only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to HIV and STDs. If two people are married and only engage in sex with one another, neither of them would ever get HIV or an STD. The following is reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): “Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men, with recent increases in syphilis being documented across the country. In 2012, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 75% of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States. MSM often are diagnosed with other STDs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.” One would think the AIDS scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships, as well as shared drug needles, are destructive behaviors. We were told that anyone could get AIDS. There’s a commercial running today that makes this claim. If this is true, then all stores should be offering tests. But they don’t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do not engage in same-sex sexual activity. Another empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation. Homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt. When morality, science, and common sense conflict with liberal ideology, you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply.

497,"""I thought Lester did a great job. Honestly, I thought Lester did a great job,"" Trump told CNNMoney shortly after the debate was over. When asked if the questions had been fair, Trump replied: ""Yeah, I thought it was very fair."" Trump's positive assessment of the moderator was matched by his own campaign manager, who said Holt ""did a great job as a moderator under tough circumstances,"" as well as many media critics and observers on social media. Related: Monday night ranks as the 'most tweeted debate ever' But even as the candidate said that, an opposite consensus was building among his supporters, surrogates and members of the conservative media. ""Lester Holt clearly heard the cries of his colleagues in the liberal media to be tough on Trump and ease up on Hillary loud and clear,"" Brent Bozell, the president of the right-wing watchdog Media Research Center, said in a statement. ""Lester Holt failed in his role as a moderator. Period."" Drudge Report, the influential conservative aggregator, led its site with stories from Heat Street and Washington Examiner that claimed Holt had been ""the third debater,"" and that his fact-checking was ""opinion journalism."" To be sure, Holt interrupted Trump more often than Clinton and fact-checked Trump more often than Clinton -- though it should be noted that Trump went over his allotted time more often and said more statements that were factually inaccurate. Related: Donald Trump's reality TV background doesn't help him in debate For most of the debate, however, Holt held back, allowing the two candidates to debate -- a move that was in line with the expectations of the Commission on Presidential Debates. ""Points to Lester Holt for standing aside and letting Trump and Clinton go at it,"" Adam Nagourney, the New York Times' Los Angeles bureau chief, wrote on Twitter. Others questioned his absence: ""Apparently Lester Holt went to the bathroom, way down the hall, and only one urinal is available and there is a line,"" National Review columnists Jim Geraghty tweeted. As the debate wore on, however, Holt stepped up to fact-check Trump on claims about his refusal to release his tax returns, his claim that he opposed the Iraq War and his history of questioning President Barack Obama's citizenship.",1,0,0
851,"Earlier this week, as part of an interview he gave to Fox News, Donald Trump announced he had just learned that Ford Motor Company was about to “fire all their employees in the United States and…move to Mexico.” Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale. Wow! That’s big news! It’s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN: “It’s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.” CNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied: “Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US. And that’s the way it will continue to be.”   Ford has 85,000 workers in the United States, and that number has risen by 50 percent over the last five years. It currently employs 8,800 people in Mexico, and the new plant will create 2,800 additional jobs there. So once again we see that Donald Trump will say anything at all in order to muddy the waters and make it appear that he is the savior of the American economy. That’s a powerful message, especially in the industrial heartland–states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin–where Trump is hoping to score big on Election Day. But Trump has financially screwed over thousands of small businesses and vendors over the years to have any legitimate clout on the economic issue. All he offers is more tax cuts for the rich and empty words. And lies. Lots and lots of lies. Tax those and we could pay off the national debt. Featured Image Via Business Trajectory  ",0,1,0
408,"Washington (CNN)Protesters angry over the police killings of unarmed black men won't prompt change through violence, President Barack Obama said during an interview Thursday. Speaking a day after riots erupted in Charlotte over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, Obama said anger should instead be redirected toward pushing needed reforms. ""The way we change the system requires us to be able to reach out and engage the broader American community. And that requires being peaceful,"" Obama said during an interview with ABC News. ""The overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police community relations doing it the right way. Every once in awhile, you see folks doing it the wrong way."" Obama -- who also offered debate advice to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the interview -- said the violence that has raged in cities such as Charlotte, Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, shouldn't distract Americans from real concerns about systemic biases within US law enforcement agencies. ""I think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African-Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always always, you know, colorblind,"" he said. Obama has sought to encourage reforms in police departments by convening a policing commission and recommending a set of common practices. But the White House says specific reforms should be left to local forces who best understand their communities' needs. ""It's the responsibility of local law enforcement leaders and local elected officials to determine how and whether to pursue the implementation of these best practices,"" Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday. ""It's not something that can be imposed by the federal government."" Clinton spoke with Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and Democratic North Carolina Rep. Alma Adams, whose district includes Charlotte, about the shooting and protests today, a Clinton aide said. They discussed ""steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law,"" the aide added. Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is considering a trip to Charlotte next week after Monday's debate, two aides told CNN. Campaign officials are looking at the logistics involved in such a trip, which would also bring Trump to a critical battleground state. In his interview with ABC, Obama also offered debate advice for Clinton, his preferred successor. ""Be yourself and explain what motivates you,"" he said. ""I think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. There's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who I know."" CNN's Jim Acosta and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1423,"The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.  What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign. But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration? *insert mechanical applause here* But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do? It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:  I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children? For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology. Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post. Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.” This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something. Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen. ",0,0,1
1305,"Donald Trump knows how to work a Republican room. Give him that. Give him a gym packed full of yahoos wearing backward baseball caps and he’ll bring down the rafters. Story Continued Below But give him a debate crowd where they let Democrats and independents in, well, he doesn’t play so well. Some candidates give energy to the crowds and some get energy from the crowds. Trump is more of a getter. He needs the crowds. And when the people are not yelling and shouting and stamping their feet for him, he just seems to dry up. Give him a crowd where the audience actually wants to hear what the two candidates for president have to say and Trump is at a disadvantage. He is used to audiences that are already primed and ready. They shout the lines to him. They shout, “Wall!” and he goes into his bit about building a wall on the Mexican border. They yell, “Benghazi!” and he goes into his bit about how Hillary Clinton was asleep at the switch. But it wasn’t Hillary who was asleep Monday night at the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York. It was Trump. He turned out to be a snooze. He needed to be an 11 and he turned in a performance that ranked about a 4. Nothing he said seemed to work. ""It's terrible what's been going on in Chicago,” he said. “I have property there."" Nothing like keeping your priorities straight, I guess. He was so off his game that he didn’t even remember to bring up the wall or Benghazi. Maybe it was his health. Trump had not been on stage for two minutes before Twitter lit up with mentions of his sniffing into the microphone. Which he did on and on. And was interrupted only by his sipping of water. And rubbing his nose with his index finger. A nonsensical “issue” to bring up when talking about the presidency? If so, why did the Trump campaign make such a big thing out of Hillary’s recent — and fleeting — bout of pneumonia? Who knows what Trump really has? If, like a lot of germophobes (he hates to shake hands, but campaigning has forced him to do so) he is also a hypochondriac, then his life must be a psychological hell right now. He knew this first debate was going to be tough. Before it started I heard a TV reporter say, “Arguably, this is the biggest night in modern American political history.” (One tip: Whenever you hear a reporter say something is “arguably,” the answer is always, “No, it’s not.”) But it was sure to be important. And Trump could have used a strategy that wouldn’t have cost him the millions of dollars he has been shelling out to the dopes around him. He could have studied up. He could have practiced. Just a little. And the need for practice is hardly a secret. These 90-minute slugfests are difficult. It’s difficult just to stand up for 90 minutes, let alone stand up for 90 minutes and talk and make sense. Hillary knew that. She is married to the best debater I have ever seen. And Bill Clinton practiced so hard for his presidential debates that he drove his staff batty. While most campaigns do mock debates to prepare, they rarely do full 90-minute mock debates every day. It’s just too draining. But Bill would insist on full mock debates and then make everybody sit down and watch the debates on tape and evaluate every word he said and every gesture he made. So Hillary did not just prepare for Monday night, her staff told reporters she was “overpreparing.” And so how did she spend the morning of the debate? By holding a mock-debate. During the real debate, she hit virtually all her talking points. She didn’t hold back. Trump, she said, had started his presidential career with racist lies over birtherism and “he has a long record of racist behavior.” There was only one argument, in fact, that I thought she blew. “I have met a lot of people who have been stiffed by you,” Hillary said. “Are they not owed an apology?” Actually, they are owed more than an apology. They are owed money. Roger Simon is POLITICO's chief political columnist.",1,0,0
1229,"The beginning of the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump included statements that would have ended the campaign of any other politician. Has an announcement speech ever looked so much like a flashily produced political suicide? Did he really just call a key part of the electorate criminals and rapists? Ever since his blunt, racially divisive debut in Trump Tower in June 2015, Trump has proven that gaffes do not singe his hide like they do the fragile and fretful politicians who tiptoe through the typical campaign for public office. Time and again, Trump poured gasoline on himself and lit a match. Time and again, pundits predicted fatal self-immolation. Instead, Trump often rode the ensuing firestorm like an Atlas rocket. His poll numbers actually went up after he insulted John McCain’s war record. What mainstream politician has ever said something like that, much less received a boost out of it? The only thing more stunning than Trump’s dismantling of campaign norms has been how consistently he has flirted with disaster. Story Continued Below He has insulted brown people, black people, Muslim people, Jewish people. He has insulted women. He has insulted the grieving parents of a dead soldier. He has mocked a disabled person and expressed admiration for dictators. He has ham-handedly pandered to a politically critical portion of the population by posting to social media a picture of gringo Tex-Mex captioning it, “I love hispanics!” He has suggested he could shoot somebody and not lose votes. He has openly talked about the possibility of the assassination of his opponent. Twice. And these are just the insults, not the demonstrable falsehoods. It helped him dispatch 16 challengers in the extended primaries of a party of which he has been an off-and-on member, and it has taken him to Monday night, to the first of three debates against Hillary Clinton—his best chance yet to get an edge in the race to become the 45th president of the United States. Amid the pre-debate speculation that he could say something at the debate that would cost him the election, it’s difficult to imagine what he could say that would do what so many other statements of his were unable to and end his campaign. Here are 37 of his gaffes that could have been fatal—but somehow weren’t. 1. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” June 16, 2015, announcement speech. 2. “He’s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” July 17, 2015, Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

After Scott exited the vehicle with an object in his hand, Trietley said officers perceived the situation as life-threatening and opened fire. “The subject got back out of the vehicle armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject,” Trietley said. According to MappingPoliceViolence.org, Keith Lamont Scott is the 214th black person to be killed by police in 2016. Officer Brentley Vinson, the officer who killed Scott, has been placed on paid administrative leave in the wake of the shooting.        ",0,1,0

1199,"The White House vetoed legislation on Friday that would allow Saudi Arabia to be sued for any alleged role in the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks — setting up what is almost certain to be the first veto override of Barack Obama’s presidency. Obama’s rejection of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act was well-foreshadowed; White House officials have repeatedly said Obama has several objections to the measure, including concerns that U.S. officials would face retaliation in the courts by foreign governments. Story Continued Below In a three-page veto message outlining his objections, Obama again stressed those arguments and others made by his administration in recent days. Particularly problematic, in Obama’s view, was the possibility that courts could end up wading into terrorism issues best left to national security and foreign policy officials. “This would invite consequential decisions to be made based upon incomplete information and risk having different courts reaching different conclusions about the culpability of individual foreign governments and their role in terrorist activities directed against the United States,” Obama said. That, the president added, “was neither an effective nor a coordinated way for us to respond to indications that a foreign government might have been behind a terrorist attacks.” Obama again reiterated the White House’s view that the 9/11 bill could lead to retaliation — which could cause “potentially seriously financial consequences for the United States,” he warned — while arguing that the 9/11 bill “threatens to create complications in our relationships with even our closest partners.” “I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously,” Obama said in the veto message. “I also have a deep appreciation of these families’ desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.” But he added that the legislation “would neither protect Americans form terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks.” Those arguments have rung hollow for Congress, which passed the legislation unanimously through both chambers. The Senate passed the measure in May, and the House followed suit earlier this month on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The Senate will move first on a veto override because the legislation, written by Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), originated there. Unless there are objections, the override vote can be set up by unanimous consent. Cornyn called not only the veto ""disappointing,"" but also Obama's ""refusal to listen to the families of the victims taken from us on Sept. 11."" And Schumer called the veto a “disappointing decision” from Obama that will be “swiftly and soundly overturned in Congress.” “If the Saudis did nothing wrong, they should not fear this legislation. If they were culpable in 9/11, they should be held accountable,” Schumer said after Obama officially vetoed the bill. “The families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn’t be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week his chamber will vote to override the legislation before lawmakers leave Washington to campaign for reelection. McConnell spokesman David Popp reiterated that on Friday, saying the chamber will take it up “as soon as practicable in this work period.” And a coalition of survivors of the 9/11 attacks, as well as the family members of the victims, released a statement saying they were “outraged and dismayed” at Obama’s veto. “No matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise, JASTA is a narrowly drawn statute that restores longstanding legal principles that have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades,” the group, known as 9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism, said. “It will deter terrorism and hold accountable those nations that support and fund it.” Key backers of the legislation expect Obama’s veto will be easily overridden, considering the unanimous show of support from Capitol Hill. Still, influential national security voices such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) have expressed concerns about potential implications of the legislation – although those sentiments had gained little traction at the Capitol because the bill has such strong support. On Friday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) began circulating a ""Dear Colleague"" letter urging lawmakers to sustain Obama's veto, echoing many of the administration's objections against the 9/11 bill. ""My primary concern is that this bill increases the risk posed to American military and intelligence personnel, diplomats, and others serving our country around the world,"" Thornberry wrote in the letter circulated among Republican lawmakers. ""Many of us have long resisted any attempt to subject U.S. military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel to criminal or civil courts around the world. These individuals who are carrying out U.S. policy must be protected. Differences should be resolved between governments based on policies, not by individual litigants in the courts."" Top congressional leaders such as Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have said they share concerns from the White House about JASTA, as it’s been known on Capitol Hill. But they also say a veto override is inevitable; Pelosi said Thursday that the White House has not reached out to her to enlist Pelosi’s help in swaying lawmakers to the administration’s side. “I think that members think that the families should have their day in court, and I think the concerns that the President has expressed are very legitimate,” Pelosi said Thursday. “The families think that they've addressed many of those concerns in the legislation.” The 9/11 bill was a rare point of agreement between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- both New Yorkers who each said they would sign the legislation if they were president. The legislation amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act to prevent countries involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil from invoking sovereign immunity, a legal principle that shields foreign nations from legal action. JASTA has long been viewed as focusing on Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in the terrorist attacks. The so-called “28 pages,” part of a 2002 probe that was declassified in July, included some indications that appear to suggest links between a handful of Saudis in the United States and two of the 9/11 hijackers.

The Republican candidate has 45% to Clinton's 42% in the Monmouth University poll, within the poll's margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson had the support of 8% of likely voters. Trump is underperforming previous GOP candidates. Mitt Romney won the state by 8 points in 2012 over President Barack Obama. The incumbent Republican senator is also out-polling Trump. Sen.

124,"If Donald Trump has his way, the constitutional right to due process will only belong to white racists. In the wake of the bombing in New York City over the weekend, police were able to apprehend a suspect named Ahmad Khan Rahami after a shootout. Rahami was hit and needed to be hospitalized to get his gunshot wound treated. And as an American citizen, he is also guaranteed the right to an attorney even if he cannot afford one. Why? Because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution say so. But Republican nominee Donald Trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in Rahamiâs case. You know, because heâs a Muslim. During a rally in Florida on Monday, Trump whined because Rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney. âNow we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And heâll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation.â Trump, who advocates for torture techniques, also demanded a speedy trial resulting in âharsh punishmentâ and suggested using âwhatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before itâs no longer timely.â Hereâs the video via YouTube.  The Fifth Amendment states: No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand juryâ¦nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. Rahami is innocent until proven guilty. So not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood, thus depriving him of life without due process. Furthermore, the Sixth Amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney, even a bombing suspect. In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. The right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country, most exemplified by Founding Father John Adams, who defended the British soldiers who were arrested after the Boston Massacre in 1770. In short, it doesnât matter who the suspect is or what they did, they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country. But Donald Trump apparently wants to put a âwhiteâs onlyâ sign on the Constitution. ",0,1,0

Casting the Republican presidential nominee as the candidate who can strengthen the economy, create jobs, peel back regulations and be tough on terrorism and immigration, the former General Electric CEO on Tuesday outlined why he is backing Trump. Story Continued Below “Basically, I want a strong economy that creates jobs,” Welch told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “This is a binary choice. You either take the Republican agenda or you take the Democratic agenda,” he continued. “The Democratic agenda is Obama-plus stated over and over again.” Regulations are also “choking” American businesses, Welch said, adding that President Barack Obama plans to increase regulations in the final months of his presidency. He also conceded that Trump, as president, may have to negotiate with Congress, meaning his proposals could get watered down before they’re enacted. “Well, it will be a negotiation with Congress. But this is his position and I like his position, and he’ll have to negotiate with Congress because Congress might not wanna reform EPA as much as he does and that’ll be a negotiation,” Welch said. “OK, that’s a fact of life. I like him negotiating from these positions a lot more than I like the Democratic candidate negotiating because she’s negotiating from Obama-plus, OK? It truly is. We might not get all this, but I like starting here and fighting like hell for it because I know it’ll grow the economy 4 percent-plus.” Welch last week told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto that he would have second thoughts about backing Cruz again, noting that he didn’t like the fact that the Texas senator hasn’t honored his pledge to support Trump as the nominee. He added that he would be casting his vote for Trump because America can’t afford eight more years of Democrats charting the nation’s economic course.",1,0,0

71,"President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. “I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message. “I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.” The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override. Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted. The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.       If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages. Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries. ""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today. ""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world."" But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. The House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort. Obama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.",1,0,0
315,"(CNN)Customs and Border Protection officers put information about Ahmad Khan Rahami into a shared law enforcement agency database and sent a notice about him after interviewing Rahami at the airport when he returned from a year-long trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2014, a US law enforcement official told CNN Tuesday. Rahami was flagged for secondary screening when he came back from the trip. It was not the first time Customs and Border Protection agents had pulled him aside for extra scrutiny after traveling to that region. The official said the information he provided about visiting his family was put into a database that can be accessed by other law enforcement agencies, noting this is routine procedure. Additionally, the official says Customs and Border Protection sent a report about Rahami to the FBI and other agencies in 2014 as someone who investigators should be aware of given his travel and the amount of time spent in areas associated with terrorist groups. A federal law enforcement official familiar with the information sent to the FBI said Rahami's information was part of a bulletin regarding a ""batch"" of people who traveled to high-risk areas. ""He was not singled out,"" the official said. The notice was sent to the FBI before August 2014, when the FBI was alerted by a tip that Rahami's father called him a terrorist. The FBI would have had access to the information when they investigated the tip. Eventually the case was closed after the father downplayed the concern. The official cautioned these bulletins are ""pretty common."" A senior law enforcement official estimated that ""several dozens"" of these individual reports are produced a week. If Rahami had raised red flags during the actual interview FBI investigators would have been brought in for further questioning of him right there in the airport, the first official said. That did not happen, the official noted. The official explained that it was not what Rahami said in interview but the fact he'd traveled multiple times to this region of concern that prompted the bulletin The official said Rahami had certain rights as a naturalized US citizen and as a result could not be held longer unless there was good reason. The senior law enforcement official, explaining the process for secondary screening, said if additional concerns are raised during secondary screening, two additional steps can be taken. An interagency report with information about the traveler can be sent forward immediately to law enforcement and intelligence agencies or the information can be integrated into the Customs and Border Protection's National Targeting Center's weekly report. If the concern is more serious, the screeners can refer the traveler to an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI. Representatives from the task force are co-located at airports like JFK and Newark due to the high volume of travelers that are a concern. ",1,0,0

Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Despite improving poll numbers, Donald Trump still faces the political equivalent of pulling an inside straight if he is to succeed to the presidency, says Karl Rove, mastermind behind both of President George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. ""Democrats have an easier path to 270 Electoral College votes than Republicans,"" Rove told David Axelrod on ""The Axe Files"" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. That advantage makes Hillary Clinton the continued front-runner in the race headed into next week's critical first debate, Rove said.  ""He's got to win all the Romney states, and as you know, three of them are up for grabs -- North Carolina, he's behind; Arizona, Georgia, barely ahead. He's got to win Florida, got to win Ohio, but that only gets him to 253. He's got to find another 17, and I think he'll win Nevada, I think he'll win Iowa, but even then that only gets him to 265. And that last five, he's got to win either New Hampshire and the second district of Maine, or Pennsylvania, or Michigan, or Wisconsin."" Rove, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, is a chairman of the Crossroads super PAC, which has thus far refused to deploy its significant resources on Trump's behalf, focusing instead on preserving Republican control of the United States Senate. The GOP entered the year in an uphill battle for the Senate, with six Republican incumbents running for reelection in blue states President Obama carried in 2012. Democrats must seize five seats, or win four and the presidency, to wrest control of the upper chamber away from the GOP.  Rove says Republican chances of holding the Senate are ""better than 50-50,"" in part because this year's electorate has ""a record number of undecideds, a record number of weak adherents"" who do not want to give either presidential nominee ""a blank check."" The conversation with Rove was taped in Kiev, Ukraine, around the Yalta European Strategy conference, at which Rove and Axelrod participated in a panel discussion on the American election. During the panel, Rove, who has been a persistent critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and trade, pointedly declined several invitations to say he would vote for the Republican nominee this fall. In his ""Axe Files"" conversation with Axelrod, Rove suggested that should Trump lose in November, Rove said Republicans could look to their party in Texas, a diverse state where the GOP has firm control, for clues as to how to proceed. ""We're a party in Texas that represents the diversity of our state. ... I think that's the formula for Republicans, and it doesn't involve sort of changing your principles; it involves sharing your principles with every community in every corner of the state.""

1207,"President Barack Obama used a pseudonym in email communications with Hillary Clinton and others, according to FBI records made public Friday. The disclosure came as the FBI released its second batch of documents from its investigation into Clinton’s private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Story Continued Below The 189 pages the bureau released includes interviews with some of Clinton’s closest aides, such as Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills; senior State Department officials; and even Marcel Lazar, better known as the Romanian hacker “Guccifer.” In an April 5, 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin was shown an email exchange between Clinton and Obama, but the longtime Clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender. ""Once informed that the sender's name is believed to be a pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: 'How is this not classified?'"" the report says. ""Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president's use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email."" The State Department has refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers have cited the ""presidential communications privilege,"" a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. The report doesn't provide more details on the contents of that particular email exchange, but says it took place on June 28, 2012, and had the subject line: ""Re: Congratulations."" It may refer to the Supreme Court's ruling that day upholding a key portion of the Obamacare law. It's been known since last year that Obama and Clinton corresponded occasionally via her private account, but the White House has insisted Obama did not know she relied on it routinely and exclusively for official business. A report on the FBI's June 7, 2016 interview with ""Guccifer"" confirms FBI Director James Comey's claim that Lazar falsely asserted that he'd surreptitiously accessed Clinton's server. ""Lazar began by stating that he had never claimed to hack the Clinton server. [An FBI agent] then advised that Fox News had recently published an article which reported that Lazar had claimed to hack the Clinton server. Lazar then stated that he recalled the interview with Fox News, and that he had lied to them about hacking the Clinton server."" Additional FBI interviewees whose reports were made public Friday included Jake Sullivan, Clinton's policy planning director; Bryan Pagliano, a former Clinton technology aide; Monica Hanley, a veteran Clinton aide who worked for her in the Senate and at State; and Sidney Blumenthal, Clinton’s longtime confidant. Hanley revealed in her FBI interview that she had no idea where a thumb drive she used to store an archive of Clinton's emails had gone. Hanley searched for the thumb drive, which the FBI described as ""something she happened to have laying around the house,"" several times but was unable to find it. The interviews provide more insight into Clinton's lack of technical acumen. According to the FBI's Abedin writeup, she ""could not use a computer""; Hanley said Clinton had no idea what her own email password was, and had to rely on aides. The so-called ""302"" reports also detail FBI interviews with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former CIA acting director Mike Morell, State Department official Pat Kennedy, State Department Inspector General Steve Linick, Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper, former diplomatic security chief Eric Boswell and longtime diplomat Lewis Lukens. Some of the interview reports had the subject's name removed on privacy grounds before the records were released. Many of those people seem to be computer technicians or lower-level State Department officials. The FBI published 58 pages of documents earlier this month that revealed Clinton had relied on others’ judgment to not send her classified material during email correspondences. “Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,” the FBI said in its Sept. 2 report. “She relied on State officials to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address.”",1,0,0
1389,"I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance. He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.  I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota. While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong. Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election. Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser. Are you outraged yet? It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes. He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related. Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour. But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that. Disgusting. ",0,0,1

Skittles spokeswoman Denise Young said that her company, Wrigley, which is the parent company that produces skittles, didnât believe Trump Jrâs image was âappropriate.â She went on to say: âSkittles are candy. Refugees are people. We donât feel itâs an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.â The Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. This meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the Trumps are. Do everything you can to keep them out of the White House, folks. VOTE BLUE. ",0,1,0
1598,"While Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are using the Brussels attack to foment Islamophobia amongst their respective bases, it’s important to note that white terrorists have killed more Americans on U.S. soil than Muslim terrorists since the 9/11 attacks. The New America Foundation (NAF), a think tank funded by prominent universities and foundations, has been keeping track of all terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11, and found that not only have white terrorists killed more Americans than jihadists, but attacks by white terrorists are also twice as frequent, with 18 homegrown terror attacks between 2004 and 2015, and just 9 terror attacks rooted in Islamic extremist ideology. To define what constitutes a terrorist, NAF has very specific criteria: The purpose of this database is to provide as much information as possible about American citizens and permanent residents engaged in violent extremist activity as well as individuals, regardless of their citizenship status, living within the United States who have engaged in violent extremist activity. We examine both those individuals motivated by Jihadist ideology, understood as those who worked with or were inspired by al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups, as well as those motivated by other ideologies that are non-Jihadist in character, for example right wing, left wing, or idiosyncratic beliefs. NAF’s list of terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001 includes 9 attacks led by jihadists, which have killed 45 people — the most recent attack being the San Bernardino shooting in December that killed 14 and wounded 21 — and 18 attacks by American right-wing extremists that killed 48 people. Most notably, while there were zero terror attacks on U.S. soil by Islamic extremists between June 2, 2009 and April 14, 2013, there were eight attacks by right-wing extremists in that time frame. The most deadly of those attacks was the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin in 2012, which left six dead and four wounded. But despite the frequency and brutality of white terror attacks, there are far more Muslim terrorists prosecuted and/or killed for their crimes in 11 of the 15 years studied. As the chart below shows, the only years between 2001 and 2015 where non-jihadist terrorists were indicted or killed for their crimes more than their jihadist counterparts were 2001, 2004, 2008, and 2012: Data from the New America Foundation Additional data shows that while jihadists were diverse in ethnicity, an overwhelming majority of American terrorists were white. Out of 182 total non-jihadist perpetrators of terror attacks in the US between 2001 and 2015, 165 were white. And while Trump is proposing an outright ban on Muslims entering the US as a way to combat terrorism, he ignores the fact that a vast majority of terrorists, both right-wing and Islamic, are American-born citizens: Data from the New America Foundation What these numbers show is that there is no catch-all solution to stop extremist terrorism. But it’s evident that simply profiling Muslims and treating all new immigrants as potential jihadists is both discriminatory and counterproductive.      ",0,1,0
1345,"Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Tuesday called out Donald Trump, saying his harsh comments about her weight have been like “a really bad dream.” Machado, a Hillary Clinton supporter, was the featured speaker on a press call organization by the Democratic nominee’s campaign, as they try to drive home the message that Trump is a misogynist with a long track record of dissing women. Story Continued Below The former beauty queen used the call to respond to Trump’s attacks against her — including calling her “Miss Piggy” — and express her support for Clinton. “I never thought 20 years later, I would be in this position, watching this guy say stupid things, make stupid comments. I never imagined that,” she said, adding, “It’s a really bad dream for me.” “My story of Miss Universe with this person can open eyes in this election,” she said. “He was not waiting for that—he was like oh my God, why did she pronounce the name?” she said of Trump’s reaction to Clinton bringing up her story. Clinton on Monday night accused Trump of objectifying and publicly shaming women, and invoked Machado in a heated moment on the debate stage. “And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them,” Clinton said. “And he called this woman Miss Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.” “Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this November,” Clinton went on to say. Machado won the Miss Universe beauty pageant in 1996, which Trump was executive producer of. Machado reportedly gained 60 pounds after winning the contest, but she later said it was closer to 15. Rumors surfaced that she would have to give up her title, or lose weight. Trump admitted to the New York Times that he pushed her to lose weight, saying, “To that, I will plead guilty.” In a 1996 interview that BuzzFeed posted on Tuesday, Howard Stern introduced the topic by saying, ""The Miss Universe, it turns out, the woman who won last year, blows up to a fat pig. I mean, like obese,"" while Trump can be heard laughing in the background. In the interview, Trump said, ""You know it was an amazing phenomenon. She weighed 118 when she won,"" adding, ""She was as beautiful a woman as I've ever seen."" He then went on to say, ""She gained about 55 pounds in a period of nine months. She was like an eating machine,"" then quipped that she, ""Ate a lot of everything,"" when Stern questioned how she could gain that much weight in that time. Machado spoke of Trump's comments to Stern in an interview with Inside Edition in May. She said in the interview that Trump told her she needed to lose weight and even brought her to a gym with a media crew. The Republican presidential nominee praised himself in the Stern interview for bringing her weight to the spotlight, saying, “It has become a major event."" Trump said on Tuesday morning that while nothing Clinton did throughout the debate to that point had managed to get under his skin, the former secretary of state’s decision to bring up Machado did frustrate him. And he went on to again attack Machado’s weight. “That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” Trump said during an interview with Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.” Machado said during the press call Tuesday afternoon that she was trying to forget the “abuse” after the pageant, saying she subsequently spent four years suffering from eating disorders. The former Miss Universe repeatedly offered her support for Clinton’s presidency, saying, “I’m with Mrs. Clinton until the end.”",1,0,0

169,"Another day, another racist dog whistle echoed by Donald Trump. While the urban unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina continues, Trump â in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential â blamed the rioting on drug use, without citing any facts to back up his claim. The comment, made in a speech in Pittsburgh, was off-script: âIf youâre not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what youâre watching on television.â Somehow, everyone but Donald Trump is unaware of the âfactorsâ contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs, but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement. What Donald Trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist, stereotype that plagues this country: blacks are on drugs, and it makes them violent. The facts are out there: white people do more drugs, and serve less time. This notion that because black Americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is, yes, racist. It reaffirms peopleâs ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels. Recent findings in theÂ American Journal of Public Health, the abuse and dependency on âhard drugsâ areÂ âless common among delinquent African American youth than those who are non-Hispanic white.â White people, in general, are also more likely to deal drugs than black people. So the people selling drugs to our kids, parents, and members of the community are more likely to be white than black, but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of Americaâs drug problem. And Donald Trumpâs claim, no matter how minuscule it may be, just makes the problem worse. Instead of accusing black Americans of being drug-induced degenerates, maybe Trump should travel up to New Hampshire and Maine, where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year, and nothing is being done to combat it. Donald Trump says the unrest in Charlotte would not happen in a Trump administration. Would New Englandâs drug epidemic be stopped under his administration? Would the killing of unarmed black people â which is the only contribution to the unrest â stop in his administration? Would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in peopleâs minds, regardless of what the facts are? Trumpâs going to get a huge wake up call with black voters in November if he keeps this up. ",0,1,0
1057,"Protests erupted overnight Tuesday into Wednesday in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a police officer shot and killed an African-American man while looking for another person who had an outstanding warrant. According to local reports, police officers saw Keith Lamont Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also African-American, shot the man. Story Continued Below ""As is standard procedure with any officer involved shooting, Officer Vinson has been placed on paid Administrative Leave,"" the police department said in a statement Tuesday night. Protesters gathered near the scene of the shooting, an area near the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Footage from the protests showed people shouting “Black lives matter,” “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “No justice, no peace.” A reporter with a local NBC affiliate posted a video of a journalist injured by a rock hurled in her direction, as the police department deployed its civil emergency unit. At 10:46 p.m., the department’s official Twitter account said that an officer “sustained injuries in an attempt to deescalate agitators during demonstration.” Approximately 12 officers were injured during the protests, according to a later tweet from the department early Wednesday morning.

1173,"It was just over a year ago, at a nationally televised debate, when Donald Trump chided Jeb Bush for speaking another language on the campaign trail. “This is a country,” Trump said standing at the lectern next to Bush, “where we speak English, not Spanish.” The crowd at the Ronald Reagan presidential library applauded. Ever since, Trump has stayed true to his word. Story Continued Below With 46 days until the November elections, and as early voting begins in a handful of states, Trump is on the precipice of becoming the only major-party presidential candidate this century not to reach out to millions of American voters whose dominant, first or just preferred language is Spanish. Trump has not only failed to buy any Spanish-language television or radio ads, he so far has avoided even offering a translation of his website into Spanish, breaking with two decades of bipartisan tradition. “He’s not willing to give into anything that shows that he wants to cater to us,” said Juan Hernandez, a Hispanic Republican and former adviser to President George W. Bush. “And he believes that he doesn’t have to. He believes he can still squeeze out a few more white, over 50 [year-old] votes.” While the majority of Latino voters are English-speaking, Trump’s refusal to campaign in Spanish is a powerful symbol of how little heed Trump has paid to America’s shifting demographics. Latinos now make up about 10 percent of the national vote, with electorally potent concentrations in crucial battlegrounds such as Florida, Colorado, Nevada and even North Carolina. Adolfo Franco, a veteran Republican strategist who served as a top Hispanic surrogate for Mitt Romney and John McCain, said he had “a more cynical view” of Trump’s studied avoidance of campaigning in Spanish. “I think they’ve made a calculation that going on Spanish TV in a more concentrated fashion and also placing ads in Spanish would upset his base,” Franco said. Trump’s bid for the White House has been powered by working-class white voters and summed up by his slogan — Make America Great Again — that appeals to a bygone era of prosperity whose disappearance is blamed on immigration and globalization. Trump called illegal Mexican immigrants rapists and drug-dealers in his announcement speech, and chants of “Build that wall!” are among the loudest at his rallies. That has left a growing number of prominent Latino Republicans on the sidelines in 2016, backing Hillary Clinton or even Libertarian Gary Johnson, whom Hernandez has endorsed. Multiple members of Trump’s National Hispanic Advisory Council resigned after his heated anti-immigrant rhetoric following his trip to Mexico. And one of the co-chairs of Romney’s Hispanic outreach operation, former Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, has starred in a Spanish-language ad this cycle — for Clinton. “Votar por Trump? No puedo,” Gutierrez says. (Translation: “Vote for Trump? I can’t.”) Romney, McCain and Bush all operated Spanish-language versions of their websites. Romney dispatched his Spanish-speaking son, Craig, as an ambassador in TV ads and on the trail (“Somos una nación de inmigrantes,” the younger Romney said in one ad). McCain and Bush, who both hailed from border states, ran Spanish-languages ads. Bush himself narrated some, memorably beginning them, “Soy George W. Bush” with his distinctive Texas accent. Four years ago, a total of $23 million was spent on Spanish-language ads in the 2012 presidential race by Obama, Romney and their backers; so far in 2016, Trump has spent zero. Trump’s campaign declined to comment for this story. The Trump campaign’s most notable dabbling in Spanish consisted of a single word — and it was misused. At the Republican convention in Cleveland, officials handed out signs that read “Hispanics Para Trump,” which both didn’t translate Hispanics and used the incorrect Spanish word for “for” (para instead of por). In recent weeks, Clinton has begun airing hundreds of thousands of dollars in Spanish-language ads in Nevada and Florida. A trio of supportive super PACs, meanwhile, have announced a $3 million Spanish-language buy, so far in those same two states, as well as Colorado. In addition, Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke in Spanish at both his vice-presidential announcement and convention speeches. Her website prominently features a half-dozen buttons atop the homepage; one of them “En español” is the portal to her Spanish-language site. “We have some voters that really want to communicate in Spanish,” said Lorella Praeli, the Clinton campaign’s Latino outreach director, describing a three-pronged approach to wooing Hispanic voters — in English, Spanish and a blend of both languages Of Trump’s approach to Latinos, Praeli said, “He has insulted us and he has tried to demonize our community from the beginning.” In a sign of Trump’s toxicity among Hispanic voters, he’s already being attacked in Spanish by a fellow Republican. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois unveiled an ad last week touting that, “Yo no apoyo a Trump,” which translates as “I don’t support Trump.” Behind the scenes, Trump’s campaign has done some quiet outreach to Latino Republicans — and been repeatedly rebuffed. Several top Hispanic Republicans, including Hernandez and Franco, told POLITICO they were recruited to join Trump Tower as surrogates or advisers. They refused. Franco said he turned them down because of Trump’s “gross generalizations, xenophobia and a number of comments that have absolutely crossed the line.” “I didn’t even answer,” Hernandez scoffed. Trump’s Hispanic outreach has been run mostly by Helen Aguirre Ferré of the Republican National Committee, who is respected by her peers, many of whom were surprised to see her take the job. She replaced Ruth Guerra, who reportedly resigned over objections to working on behalf of Trump. (Unlike Trump, the RNC has produced some materials in Spanish.) But few other prominent Hispanic Republicans have come on board. That has hurt the Trump campaign’s presence on Spanish-language television programs, where the surrogate program has been weak, said Alfonso Aguilar, who mobilized Hispanic supporters for Trump in July before rescinding his endorsement in protest over Trump’s immigration speech after his Mexico visit. Aguilar said he told the campaign, “You’re leaving a vacuum for the opposition to define the narrative in Spanish-language media and that’s exactly what’s happening.” When he was a surrogate, Aguilar said, there were no talking points or fact sheets, as there had been in the Romney, McCain and Bush campaigns. “You can run a campaign that’s different,” Aguilar said. “But you still need a professional operation.” Lionel Sosa, who cut ads targeting Hispanic voters for Ronald Reagan, including in Spanish, said he was among those contacted by Trump’s team this year. He said he told them he would only help the campaign if Trump apologized for his past offensive remarks. “I just can’t stomach Donald Trump,” Sosa said. Instead, he’s backing Johnson. Sosa predicted Trump would win no more than 22 percent of the Latino vote — worse than Romney’s much-maligned 27 percent and far short of Bush’s high-water mark of 44 percent in 2004. (A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on Thursday put Trump at 17 percent among likely Hispanic voters.) The path to the White House via an overwhelmingly white coalition is a narrow one. Romney won the highest share of the white vote in three decades, 59 percent, and still lost in 2012. And whites are expected to comprise a smaller share of the electorate in 2016 than 2012, due to the faster demographic growth among minorities nationwide. Trump’s team recognizes the difficult math they face, given their candidate’s rhetoric and narrow coalition. It’s one of the reasons the Republican nominee has begun publicly appealing to black voters, appearing at African-American churches and talking about the plight of black America at many of his rallies. The Latino community has been mentioned far less often by Trump. “In a way, he’s being smart,” said Alex Nogales, president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition and a Trump critic. “Why waste his money on a community that’s not going to vote for him?”",1,0,0

659,"This very week, when Americans were shaken by yet several more violent attacks across the nation by Radical Muslim terrorists, we as a nation were shocked and numbed in disbelief by plans still firmly in place by the Obama administration to bring in 110,000 Muslim refugees from the Middle East this year. Hillary Clinton, on the stump campaigning for President, vows to increase those numbers of poorly vetted Muslim immigrants to more than 620,000 her first year in office if elected. The stark raving madness of such plans is unfathomable. It is a widely known fact that there is no means of screening this huge wave of Muslim immigrants to determine which among them are radical extremists and thus potential terrorists. Nor do we have any database to screen them for potential criminals or with criminal pasts. Additionally we have no means to screen them to learn whether or not they are willing to assimilate into the mainstream culture and values of American life. Yet inexplicably, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are deadly serious in their hardened determination to bring these 600,000-plus Muslim immigrants to America at the very time that deadly acts of terrorism are on the increase by radical Muslims on American soil. The number one job of the US President is to keep our citizens safe and secure. Yet to both American citizens in the various states and local communities, as well as among state and local elected officials it is increasingly obvious that security and safety is rapidly vanishing and that we are in “clear and present danger”. The governors of at least two dozen states have forcefully opposed the immigration and resettlement of Muslims, not only because of the “no questions asked” open door policy, but also due to proven incidents of crime and violence by Muslim immigrants who were resettled by Obama in Twin Falls, Idaho, Minneapolis, Minnesota, New England and elsewhere. This week Texas governor Greg Abbott flatly declared his firm refusal to resettle any additional Mideast Muslim immigrants in Texas, citing the potential dangers to American citizens and Texas residents for outright defiant refusal. While more than two dozen states, led again by Texas have sued the Obama administration for various and egregious abuses of power and unconstitutional executive overreaches meddling in state and local matters, the action this week by Texas governor Abbott consisted of an outright, defiant refusal. As a writer with a strong knowledge of American history, the Constitution and the workings of government, Governor Abbott’s action on behalf of Texas this week strongly suggests the invoking of the Tenth Amendment protecting states’ rights, and thus the principle of nullification of unconstitutional federal acts against states. The nullification principles have been debated in terms of scope and circumstantial legality at various times since before the Civil War. For decades after Union Victory nullification of unlawful federal action, as well as secession from the union, appeared to be settled as illegal. However, the Southern States resurrected the issues of nullification and secession during the battle over civil rights and racial integration in the 1950s and 60s. Given the “moral high ground” advantage owned by the Feds at the time the notion of nullification gained little political steam. The past eight years of the Obama administration, which has wrought untold misery to Americans though both disastrous policies and increasingly lawless and unconstitutional executive actions, has revived the Tenth Amendment, states’ rights issue and the principle of nullification of unlawful federal actions by one or more states has been resurrected with a vengeance. With radical Islamic terrorism spreading like wildfire around the world, including Europe and now in America, local officials and governors in over half the states are frantically working to find legitimate means to protect citizens and preserve the rule of law. Even the two centuries old “checks and balances” in three separate branches of government no longer apply; for two years the GOP majority in Congress utterly refused to check and limit the dangerous, lawless overreach of Obama’s executive branch, and numerous federal courts, including the Supreme Court have also failed to limit executive branch lawlessness. The astounding rise of Donald Trump, the Tea Party, the open revolt against “Washington Political Establishment, along with the widely understood tyrannical executive actions by Obama that go unchallenged, State governors are banding together to fight federal tyranny. On the “frontier strip” an organization called “Free Nebraska” has led the way in partnership with similar movements in other states, to call for the convening of a”convention of states”. It appears very likely when analyzing these related events in clear resistance to dangerously growing federal power and control over issues that are in the prerogative of individual states, that the highly unusual and noteworthy action of the governor of Texas to directly confront the federal government and Mr. Obama, that state-by-state nullification actions and declaring state government sovereignty under the “reserve clause” (powers reserved to the states)of the Tenth Amendment is a growing conflict. Knowing the tyrannical nature of the Federal Government, the growing power struggle escalating into a states’ rights nullification battle involving potentially a score or more of state governors is certain to quickly turn ugly and potentially violent. Given the precarious political situation and this Presidential election the most consequential in American history, a nullification battle involving states’ rights to limit and push back against federal tyranny, the nullification battle begun by Texas appears very likely to further divide America as some state governments rebel and other states acquiesce. Let us pray to our Lord that freedom will be restored peacefully. However an already deeply divided America is being further divided and clearly leading to open rebellion, we must also pray for avoidance of civil insurrection. The stark reality however, is that federal tyranny is clearly headed toward dictatorship, and the bitter but forced choice between liberty and tyranny will result in a ferocious struggle to restore American liberty and the outcome, while uncertain, is just as clearly leading to a historical confrontation and bitter conflict. May God bless America as we endeavor to confront and defeat the tyranny in Washington, D.C. Freedom comes with a price; to restore freedom to America that price will be high. Let us pray to Almighty God that He will empower us to overcome the monstrous evil we now face, and fight. ",0,0,1

1054,"That Donald Trump’s campaign has had more returns from the dead than a soap opera villain is hardly a novel observation. What is noteworthy is the manner in which he’s bounced back. Time and again, Trump has survived what only a few years ago would have been considered career-ending gaffes—from calling women “pigs,” to boasting about his sexual prowess, to repeatedly insulting war heroes, to offending Mexicans during his off-the-cuff announcement speech, to misspelling basic vocabulary words like “lightweight” and “honor” on his Twitter feed. This is a man, after all, who forged his political identity by questioning loudly, without any real evidence, on multiple occasions, and in defiance of every rule of politics, the place of President Obama’s birth. And yet here he stands—one or two battleground states away from the White House. This defies all the rules of public life as we’ve come to understand them. For decades, a single spontaneous outburst (John Kerry’s “I was for it before I was against it”), a pompous proclamation (whatever Al Gore intended to say about his role in the Internet), a cuckoo pronouncement (George Romney’s claim to have been “brainwashed” about the Vietnam War), or even an embarrassing misspelling (Dan Quayle’s infamous attempt to correctly write the word “potato” on a blackboard), caused irreparable, often campaign-ending damage. Trump has done all these things—some of them multiple times in the same day. The gaffe hasn’t destroyed Trump; it’s made him stronger. The reasons for this are instructive, and they will change the way politics is practiced forever. Story Continued Below At one level, Trump’s survival, so far, is less a testament to his shrewdness—though it is a disservice to claim he hasn’t been shrewd—than it is to Washington’s studied cowardice. Trump is not only making gaffes, he’s brashly owning them, daring the political gods to smite him in what has become an epic rebuke to the dull, predictable, cautious political culture that everyone outside the Beltway has learned to recognize and abhor. In terror of the gaffe, candidates have increasingly immersed their true selves behind carefully vetted talking points, anodyne scripts, and cynical consultants, all with the primary purpose of suffocating in its cradle anything approaching a cavalier statement, never mind a surprising or provocative thought. The culmination of this effort is before us: the enthusiasm-starved campaign of Hillary Clinton, who over her decades in politics has perfected the talent of making even the most cutting-edge idea immediately sound like a cliche. Set against this apotheosis of safe, gaffe-free politics, millions have delightedly embraced a man who seems to recognize their appetite for something recognizably real, even if it’s vulgar and offensive. His gaffes aren’t a sideshow: they’re integral to his pitch. For this cohort, a vote for Trump is a vote to make the safe, protected, consultant-scripted lives of everyone in D.C. miserable every single day, because they’ve earned it. The larger explanation for the Trump phenomenon is even more unsettling for Washington’s political class, especially the media. They have lost their power. Only a decade or two ago, the media world was confined to a group of people in D.C. and New York—a group that largely knew each other, mingled in the same places, vacationed in the same locales. The most influential members of the group routinely defined what constituted a gaffe, others echoed that view, and it became the conventional wisdom for the rest of America. In the age of the Internet, with bloggers spread out across the nation, and multiple platforms across the political spectrum, that’s no longer possible. The growing divergence between these “insiders” and the new “outsiders” has played to Trump’s benefit, every single time he made what was once conceived as a “game-changing” error. The first test of this new dynamic arrived on Trump Day One, when the candidate tossed aside a prepared announcement speech that would have made him sound, well, normal, in favor of a stream-of-consciousness ramble that began with an anecdote about candidates “sweating like dogs,” who were somehow incapable of beating ISIS to claiming that Mexico, in some diabolical frenzy, was shipping rapists and ax murderers to America by the dozens. Commenting that “the U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,” he quickly trained his ire on the influx of illegal immigrants across the Mexican border. He claimed that Mexico, presumably the government of Mexico, was “sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Most candidates, of course, know as a general rule that it’s rarely a good idea to include the name of an ethnic group and the word “rapists” in the same sentence. Trump either didn’t know this rule, didn’t appreciate what he was saying in the midst of a full ramble, or didn’t care. The “insider” media went to work, claiming that Trump had insulted not only all Mexicans, but all immigrants. (This was an exaggeration.) Boycotts ensued. Trump lost his deals with Macy’s and NBC. The “outsider” view was very different. Time and again, Republican voters have told their political leaders that illegal immigration was a major concern. The issue led to a rare uprising against George W. Bush during his second term when he pushed what many of his base considered “amnesty,” almost derailed John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008, and haunted Marco Rubio throughout 2016. But most GOP leaders, believing “comprehensive immigration reform” was the key to attracting Hispanic voters, didn’t get it. They ignored their core voters on the issue. Trump sounded as perplexed and angry as they were. What he said wasn’t a gaffe, not to them. It showed he was listening—a skill Washington lost many election cycles ago. This pattern has repeated itself ever since. If you were a campaign consultant looking to the future, it would be worth studying Trump’s “gaffes”—not to avoid them, but to figure out just why they work so well. If you list them and pick them apart, you could start to see them as a playbook for a new kind of anti-Washington politics, one in which the candidate speaks right past the old “insider” audience of media and Beltway elites, and delivers an outsider electorate exactly what it had been waiting to hear. Here’s how it works, in three examples: 1. Ben Carson the “Psychopath” On the campaign trial, Trump cites Ben Carson’s acclaimed memoir, which discusses Carson’s violent temper during his youth. (Carson is currently threatening Trump’s front-runner status in polls.) “It's in the book that he's got a pathological temper,"" Trump tells an interviewer. ""That's a big problem because you don't cure that ... as an example: child molesting. You don't cure these people. You don't cure a child molester. There's no cure for it. Pathological, there's no cure for that."" Insider: Trump destroys himself and permanently alienates Carson and his supporters by comparing Carson to a child molester. (Which Trump, arguably, didn’t exactly do.) Outsider: Trump is a fighter, willing to use Carson’s own words directly against him. The media does this to politicians all the time. What’s the big deal? Outcome: Trump overtakes Carson in polls. Carson ultimately forgives Trump, endorses him for president and serves as a surrogate for him—except when Carson needs to find his luggage. TRUMP WIN 2. McCain the “Captured” War Hero At an Iowa event in June 2015, Trump outrageously questions John McCain’s war hero status (after McCain went after Trump supporters as “crazies.”) “He’s not a war hero,” said Trump, before immediately reversing himself. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” Insider View: We all know John McCain—great guy, war hero, very quotable. Who in their right mind would take on a POW who endured torture for more than five years in his nation’s service, especially a guy who never served in uniform himself? Proof positive that Trump’s nuts. Outsider View: Trump probably went too far on this, but many of us don’t like amnesty-supporting McCain all that much anyway. Besides, McCain was taking cracks at Trump. Why shouldn’t he respond? Outcome: Eventually, after much resistance, Trump quasi-apologizes by claiming he didn’t say what he obviously meant to say. McCain endorses Trump for the presidency. TRUMP WIN 3. Bush the Warmonger Fresh off of his victory in New Hampshire, Trump heads to South Carolina, the alleged Bush “firewall” where his brother, George W. Bush, is going to campaign for his brother Jeb. During a televised debate in the veteran-thick state, Trump says W. “lied” about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in order to go to war: “They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none.” He is greeted with boos from the audience. Insiders: South Carolina veterans will not forgive Trump for insulting the Bushes or repeating the left’s claims that Bush lied the country into war. We’ve been assured all year long by Bush campaign people that Jeb was going to win in South Carolina, a state with nostalgic love for the Bushes. Trump made a huge miscalculation with his latest outburst. Outsiders: The Bushes are yesterday’s news. And, come to think of it, why did we go into Iraq? Outcome: Trump wins the South Carolina primary by about 10 points. Bush comes in fourth and drops out of the race. TRUMP WIN Care to continue? I didn’t think so. And I still haven’t gotten to how Trump wondered aloud whether Ted Cruz’s dad may have been in or near the grassy knoll the day of the Kennedy assassination—nor to Trump’s brilliant response when called on his epic troll: “They didn’t deny it.” By the time Trump gaffed his way to the Republican nomination, furious and frustrated media outlets had been grappling for months with how to hold him to account, as they’ve managed with other candidates in the past. A journalist asked Trump to identify the “five sources” that he claimed had told him Mexico was deliberately sending criminals across our border. The brilliance, of course, was in the number. Not one. Not two. But five people. Who would make up a number like that? In any event, Trump refused to disclose their names. Were they business colleagues? Informants from the Mexican government? Did all of them have the last name Trump? We’re left to wonder. Most people didn’t seem to care. He’s probably making it up, they think, but whatever. Multiple Web pages and assorted news articles have devoted themselves to chronicling Trump’s habit of making an outrageous statement, and then later denying such statement was ever made. Examples abound: that Marco Rubio was the personal senator for Mark Zuckerberg, that the pro-free-market Trump had supported health care mandates, that he ever told supporters to “knock the crap” out of protesters, after some did just that. Trump’s infuriating ability to wiggle out of all sorts of statements has left fact-checkers—who have labeled him among the biggest fibbers in recent political history—in a state of distress. After all, a decades-long pattern of denying clear and unequivocal statements is the kind of audacity usually reserved for the Clintons. Which, come to think of it, may be why Trump’s dalliances with deception hasn’t seem to outrage people who don’t work in the media. The latest effort is the Instant Fact Check—in which cable news channels, such as CNN, note in real-time whether a candidate is making a truthful claim, as in “Trump (falsely) claims X.” One doesn’t get the impression that these “instant” fact-checks have been applied quite so forcefully to Hillary Clinton. And this, too, seems to have blown up in their collective faces, signaling to outsiders that the mainstream media, as they suspected, is just in the tank for the Democrats. In the years-long battle between Trump and his Javert-like media interlocutors, nothing has led to more perfectly justified hysteria than his pirouette over the Obama birther business. As far as conspiracy theories go, the rock-solid contention that Barack Obama was not born in the United States was always of the nonsensical variety. After all, even if he had been born someplace else, no fault of his own, the president still would have been born to an American citizen, his mother. That alone would qualify him for the presidency, just as much as it does Cruz, or McCain, or George Romney (all of whom were not born in the U.S.) But the dark and daffy corners of the so-called alt-right is no place for logic. Last week, as he began passing Clinton in many polls, Trump seemed to have fallen prey to the “birther” gaffe again by refusing to say whether he believed the president was born in the United States. Media outlets could not believe their luck—Trump was stepping into it again. Or was he? At a news conference devoted to promoting his new D.C. hotel, Trump finally announced his (latest) position: “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.” This was Trump at his most fiendish. Not only had he repudiated his own long history as a “birther,” not only had he lured the national news media into giving wall-to-wall coverage of a hotel opening, he blamed his opponent for the whole thing. No other activity in recent political history engendered as much of an outcry from the insider media, with the possible exception of Sarah Palin’s nomination for the vice presidency of the United States. To the insiders, no single moment in the campaign was more appalling, or revealing of Trump’s singular mendacity. His pirouette not only made fools of the press by getting them to cover an infomercial disguised as a news conference, it was a brazen effort to shift blame for a controversy that Trump did more than any other prominent American to promote. Surely, the press assumed, the public would see this? They saw it, all right—but not in the same way. To an outsider, a savvy businessman had just engineered a brilliant ad for his latest venture, while efficiently backing away from a controversy he probably didn’t take all that seriously anyway. And as he did it, he left the media caught just a bit in a trap of its own. As they rushed to attack Trump on his latest “lie,” most outlets conveniently omitted to mention that in fact there was some truth in Trump’s contention. The Clinton campaign may not have “started” the birther controversy. But it was circulated by her supporters, and Clinton world definitely had a hand in it. According to a former editor with the McClatchy News Service, one of Clinton’s closest confidants, Sidney Blumenthal, personally spread the “birther” story himself. (Blumenthal flatly calls this “false,” leaving the story in “his word against mine” territory.) What an unbiased observer might conclude from all of this is that many mainstream media outlets, so blinded in their distaste for Trump and so determined to unmask him as an unprecedented liar, have now compromised themselves in the process. Which is one more lesson from the Trump playbook: If you make enough gaffes, pretty soon your crazed critics will start making gaffes of their own.",1,0,0
811,"An English man, Liam Edwards, has been arrested and now awaits trial because he placed some anti-halal stickers on meat products at a local grocery store in his hometown of Salford. Halal refers to the method in which Muslims prepare meat before and after slaughter. Edwards rightfully opposes halal because it hosts ties to not only terrorism, but animal cruelty as well. The stickers read, “Beware! Halal is barbaric and funds terrorism #BanHalal”:  Just a month ago, for instance, an undercover video shot by an animal charity organization showed Muslims at a North Yorkshire slaughterhouse “sawing at the animals’ necks with seemingly blunt knives, stamping on the sheep and kicking them in the head as they attempted to get them onto the conveyor belt.” Furthermore, according to an Australian anti-Islamic activist known only as Ms. Smith, the money procured from halal slaughterhouses tends to be used to fund extremism. Added to this is the fact that those brands who choose to purchase halal-certified meat must pay an Islamic religious tax. None of these facts apparently matter to the prosecuting attorney in Liam’s case, Holly Holden, who opined in court that “the point about animal slaughter can be expressed in a different way without suggesting halal and terrorism is linked.” As a result, Liam now faces charges of “racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage” and must go to trial on July 23 (H/T Breitbart). I guess offending Muslims with facts is not acceptable in England. It’s a shame Liam doesn’t live in the United States, where the First Amendment protects every citizen’s right to speak (or write) the truth, regardless of whom that truth offends. Please share this post on Facebook if you too find animal cruelty and terrorism to be far more offensive than fact-based anti-halal stickers. Via Conservative Tribune ",0,0,1
362,"(CNN)Michelle Obama on Tuesday joked about the plagiarism controversy that engulfed Melania Trump during the Republican National Convention, delivering a dry retort when ""The Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to the plight of a fellow political spouse. ""Melania Trump was criticized for using what turned out to be a portion of your speech -- but do you have any sympathy? Because there are people around her creating things, and you know, I have sympathy for her. Do you understand how that might be sympathetic, for what happened to her?"" the CBS host asked. ""Yeah, that was tough,"" Obama deadpanned, prompting laughs from the audience. Colbert also asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to political spouses who are required to stand behind partners whose political beliefs are antithetical to their own -- a premise Obama flatly rejected. ""Do you have any sympathy for the people who have to go there and stand by the person running for president?"" ""No,"" Obama replied. ""Because if -- you know, you have to be, you know, in it. If you're in it, and if you don't agree, you should have agreed before they ran. Bottom line is, if you didn't agree with what Barack was saying, I would not support his run. So I stand there proudly, and I hope they are, too, standing with their spouses proudly. So no, no sympathy."" During her appearance on the show, Obama also joked around with Colbert, climbing into a blanket fort with the host (a recurring segment on the show) to discuss serious issues, like investment in education for young girls around the world, and less serious ones -- such as when a conversation about healthy eating turned into a joke about how eating too many carrots can turn someone orange. ""And if you turn really orange, you have to start saying crazy things and run for president,"" Colbert cracked. ",1,0,0
526,"Washington (CNN)Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has some tips for Donald Trump before the next presidential debate. Gingrich, who is a supporter and adviser to Trump's presidential campaign, chatted with CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel about Monday night's showdown. His assessment: ""(Trump) didn't throw an interception. He didn't make a major mistake."" The Georgia Republican believes Trump won, but concedes pundits are fair to criticize the Republican nominee for taking the bait and getting off message, especially on the ""birther"" question and his tax returns. Gingrich admits Trump ""doesn't have a good answer on birther and he doesn't have a good answer on taxes."" But he is quick to point out that Monday was Trump's first one-on-one debate, and ""he is doing fine."" Next week, when Trump faces Clinton again, Gingrich said the Republican nominee should alter his strategy: Prepare: Come to the debate with ""a few more facts, but not too many."" Discipline: Stay on offense and on message -- ""He's change versus the old order."" Pivot: Get off the topics you don't like faster, and make it about her. Specifically, when asked about tax returns, Gingrich suggests Trump focus on the disclosure of the Clinton Foundation and Clinton's emails. Earlier on Tuesday, Gingrich focused more on Hillary Clinton, when he tweeted: ""I worked with Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton and I got a lot done ... Hillary Clinton is no Bill Clinton."" ",1,0,0
1085,"Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has been doggedly reporting on Donald Trump's charitable record, tracking down everything from $10,000 paintings of Trump paid for by his non-profit foundation to his promised donations to veterans. And in the wake of statements from the Trump campaign personally attacking Fahrenthold, the Post is pushing back. ""The Trump campaign's response to our reporting has been full of personal insults and devoid of any discussion of the facts,"" senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg said in a statement. ""We have reached out to the campaign repeatedly, by phone, email and on social media, and they have yet to answer our questions. We welcome a response that addresses the legitimate questions raised about the Trump Foundation."" The Trump campaign has not responded to Fahrenthold's detailed questions about Trump's donations, but issued a comment late Tuesday after an explosive new report by Fahrenthold showed that Trump used $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses. In a statement on Tuesday evening, spokesman Jason Miller said the Post, a news organizations Trump had previously blacklisted, has ""gotten their facts wrong."" ""It is the Clinton Foundation that is set up to make sure the Clinton's personally enrich themselves by selling access and trading political favors,"" Miller said. ""The Trump Foundation has no paid board, no management fees, no rent or overhead, and no family members on its payroll. There was not, and could not be, any intent or motive for the Trump Foundation to make improper payments. All contributions are reported to the IRS, and all Foundation donations are publicly disclosed. Mr. Trump is generous both with his money and with his time. He has provided millions of dollars to fund his Foundation and a multitude of other charitable causes."" The statement then went on to personally attack Fahrenthold, a theme echoed by campaign manager Kellyanne Conway who in an interview on CNN said Fahrenthold has an ""obsession"". ""The Post’s reporting is peppered with inaccuracies and omissions from a biased reporter who is clearly intent on distracting attention away from the corrupt Clinton Foundation, a vehicle for the Clinton's to peddle influence at the expense of the American people. Mr. Trump personally and the Trump Foundation, however, are staying focused on their charitable giving to veterans, the police, children and other deserving recipients,"" Miller said.

He has no job. The places he could hire me—the casinos that he has that have showrooms—he put into bankruptcy. He no longer owns them. So, he can’t hire me, plus I have a job, so that’s all completely fake, right?” Jillette reported that while he was on the show, the Trump organization tried to coerce him into endorsing a potential Trump presidency. “There was a time when they asked me while I was still on the show if Donald Trump ran for president, if I’d support him, and I said absolutely not. And I believe, and this may be the most damning thing you’ll hear me say about Trump, I believe I liked him more than anyone else who was on that show. During that time I said I would not support him for president. Now, I get a call instantly. Instantly! From the powers that be—not Trump himself—saying, ‘No, no, no. You must support him as president.’ They say ‘It’s going to come down to you and Trace [Adkins], and he’s going to want to know that you both support him for president. And I said, ‘Well, I don’t.’ And they said, ‘Well, you have to because he’s trying to—he’s looking at the big picture here.’ And I go, ‘We’re on a television show.'” Penn is an avowed libertarian, loyal to neither the Republican or the Democratic parties, and currently endorses Gary Johnson. Despite not being a big fan of Clinton, Penn says that Trump is an unusually incompetent candidate: “However bad you think he is, he’s worse.” “I think he doesn’t really have strong convictions and sense of right and wrong. He’s not really, really smart. He’s not stupid, you know. He’s not a dumb guy, but he’s not smart like presidents are smart. We make jokes—everybody’s makes jokes except me about George W. Bush not being smart. He’s smart. He just is. Obama’s smarter? Probably, sure. Obama’s smarter than Clinton? Probably. Almost certainly. But they’re up here, you know, and if we’re talking about it. You’re wherever you are, but you’re not smarter than Obama, you know. None of us are. Even the smart guys you know aren’t there. And Trump isn’t one of those people. He’s not someone who when you’re having a conversation with him—I probably listened to him talk for, I don’t want to exaggerate, but probably eight or nine hours.

978,"NEW YORK — Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's decisions to meet separately with Egypt's authoritarian president on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly have prompted a growing outcry on both the left and the right. On Monday, a small group of scholars and activists with a focus on Egypt, including some who identify as conservatives, released a letter they had written to both presidential candidates urging them not to meet with Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The authors pointed to the thousands of people killed and imprisoned under Sisi's harsh rule. Story Continued Below ""Since taking power via a military coup three years ago, President Sisi has overseen not only the complete reversal of Egypt’s nascent democratic transition but also unprecedented human rights abuses,"" states the letter. ""It is not in our interest to embrace him but to use our influence to press for beneficial change in Egypt."" The letter, dated Friday, further states: ""Your meeting with Sisi at the UNGA will be taken in Egypt, and around the world, as an endorsement. To meet with him is a policy decision, which should await a later date after much study and assessment of U.S. policy toward Egypt. Therefore, we strongly urge you to readjust your schedule."" The signatories were: Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution; Elliott Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations; Reuel Gerecht of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies; Neil Hicks of Human Rights First; and Stephen McInerny of Project on Middle East Democracy. The letter writers are part of a non-partisan working group on Egypt that has been meeting since 2010, according to Kagan. Their criticism follows that of others including Human Right Watch's executive director Ken Roth, who wrote on Twitter: ""Why does Hillary again want to meet Sisi? He directed 817+ killed in 12 hours in Rabaa Sq"" — a reference to a massacre in a Cairo square under Sisi's watch in 2013. Clinton met with Sisi on Monday evening; the Egyptian leader told her at the start of the meeting that he wished to talk to her “about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties. And as a matter of fact we are taking this path that is eventually leading up to this target,” according to a pool report of the event. Trump's team released an account of his meeting with Sisi that was striking in how much praise the Republican heaped on Egypt. Trump expressed to Sisi ""his strong support for Egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Sisi, a retired general, came to prominence during the chaos of Egypt's 2011 Arab Spring revolution. He took power in 2013 after mass protests prompted the military to oust the elected government of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. Trump has said that if elected president, he will work with Sisi to fight terrorism, describing him in a speech as someone who recognizes that ""this ideology of death that must be extinguished."" Clinton is critical of Sisi's predecessor, Morsi, who was arrested after his ouster and now faces a death sentence, in ""Hard Choices,"" her memoir about her years as secretary of state. But Clinton also has criticized Sisi, who she wrote ""appears to be following the classic mold of Middle Eastern strongmen."" Clinton's decision to meet with Sisi could stem from a desire to signal to Arab allies in the region that she will partner with rulers who impose stability, even if those rulers are autocrats.",1,0,0
398,"Washington (CNN)The military assesses that the shell fired on a joint US-Iraqi base Tuesday was indeed a chemical weapon, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford. ""We assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent,"" Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. It is the first time the military has confirmed its assessment on the record since CNN reported the development Wednesday. A US military official told CNN, however, that the first field test for chemical agent was positive and the second test was negative. The substance was sent to a coalition-operated Iraq-based lab, and tests there were inconclusive. The official said the sample will now be sent to another lab for additional testing. RELATED: ISIS suspected of mustard attack against US and Iraqi troops Dunford described ISIS as only having a ""rudimentary"" capability to deliver the chemical, saying the weapon ""wasn't particularly effective, but it is a concerning development."" The general went on to say that the US-led counter-ISIS coalition has conducted ""over 30"" airstrikes against suspected ISIS chemical weapons facilities during the past year. Committee Chairman John McCain said that the situation was ""concerning, particularly on those people who don't have protective equipment."" The Arizona Republican was referring to civilians and other local forces that have been subjected to ISIS chemical attacks in the past. The more than three-hour-long testimony also featured a few heated exchanges between members of the committee and witnesses Dunford and Defense Secretary Ash Carter over the defense budget and whether a no-fly zone could be implemented in Syria. Dunford acknowledged that the administration is ""in deliberation"" about the prospect of arming Kurdish forces in Syria, saying that doing so would ""increase the prospects of our success in Raqqa."" He noted, though, that US ally Turkey's opposition to American support for the Kurds makes the situation ""difficult."" Dunford had harsh words for Russia, calling it ""potentially the most significant threat to our national interests."" ""A combination of their behavior as well as their military capability ... would cause me to believe that they pose the most significant challenge potentially, the most significant threat to our national interests,"" he said, referring to their incursions in Georgia and Ukraine. He also said Russia was responsible for the recent airstrike that targeted a UN aid convoy in Syria while noting that both Syrian and Russian aircraft had been in the vicinity of the area at the time of the attack. ""It was either the Russians or the regime,"" Dunford said, adding, ""There's no doubt in my mind that the Russians are responsible. I just don't know whose aircraft actually dropped the bombs."" Carter concurred, saying, ""The Russians are responsible for this strike whether they conducted it or not"" due to their association with the Syrian regime. Their comments come as the prospects of the US-Russia negotiated ceasefire in Syria, which would include Russian-American military cooperation in fighting the terror groups ISIS and al Nusra, appears poised to collapse. McCain slammed the accord, calling it ""deeply problematic even if implemented."" He also took a swipe at top US diplomat John Kerry, saying, ""President (Barack) Obama sent his intrepid but delusional secretary of state to tilt yet again at the windmill of cooperating with Vladimir Putin.""

180,"If you’ve spent much time on social media, you might notice that almost regardless of the subject, a string of anti-Hillary memes seems to just automatically show up. That’s not a coincidence. It’s all part of a highly coordinated “shitposting” designed by billionaire and Oculus founder, 24-year-old Palmer Luckey. Luckey is best known as a boy genius who invented his version of virtual reality goggles, called the Oculus Rift. Facebook bought Luckey’s company in 2014 for $2 billion. Forbes estimates that he’s worth about $700 million. The epicenter of his trolling seems to come from Reddit, where he uses the pseudonym “NimbleRichMan.” Luckey is a backer, likely the key backer of a pro-Trump 501(c)(4) charitable “social welfare” organization that’s dedicated to backing Trump. If you think that sounds seriously sketchy, you’d be right. According to the IRS, a 501(c)(4) is not supposed to have politics as its primary activity, and any politicking it does is not tax exempt. published an expose on Thursday, which says in part: Nimble America says it’s dedicated to proving that “shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real,” according to the company’s introductory statement, and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of Pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image of Clinton’s face alongside the words “Too Big to Jail.” “We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit. People on Reddit aren’t happy. In fact, the biggest pro-Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, refused to believe that Luckey was NimbleRichMan, but Luckey insisted that he’s just the money behind the idea and well, he did it for a lark – because, you know, screwing with the future of the free world is fun! “I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.” He prides himself on putting out memes that are so bad that even the Trump campaign wouldn’t promote them. Before you think he’s a Millennial who is still angry that Bernie Sanders didn’t win, think again.

130,"A racist Georgia man went completely off the deep endÂ when faced with road work on his way home, threatening the construction crew with a gun while shoutingÂ racial slurs. Construction worker Nelson King said that on Thursday morning they were working on a section of road inÂ Coweta County.Â Harold Bishop was on his way home when he came upon the portion of the road that had been closed for construction. The 72-year-old man then proceeded to completely freak theÂ f*ck out and began waving around a gun while shouting racial epithets at the crew. âHe pulled up on us and he was like, âGet these N-word off the road, I live here, Iâll kill you N-word,ââ King recalled. When Bishop pulled out his gun for the second time, King decided to start recording the incident while another man working at the scene called 911. According to the Coweta County Sheriffâs Office, Bishop then left the scene but returned before police showed up. King said he decided to record the manâs threats so that he would have proof of what was happening. âIf I can show proof that he pulled the gun out,â said King, âpolice will get him.â It was a good thing King had decided to make theÂ video of Bishop threatening them with his gun because when police showed up they saw him throw a beer out of the window and smelled alcohol on him, but they could not find the weapon. Thatâs when King whipped out the proof. âI showed police the video and they seen the gun when he pointed it at us, they were like oh heâs got to go,â said King. Bishop has been charged withÂ charged with five counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, weapon pointing a gun at another, terroristic threats, DUI, and probation violation. He is currently being held without bond and is due in court on September 22. Watch more, here:  ",0,1,0
258,"Washington (CNN)Six days before the crucial first presidential debate, Donald Trump is using a spate of bombings and stabbings to build an interlocking argument on two issues where he thinks tough talk gives him a winning hand -- immigration and terrorism. The attacks over the weekend mercifully did not kill anybody -- but they inevitably put the fear of terrorism back at the center of the showdown between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. From Trump's point of view, the new terror scares play directly into a vision of a nation under siege and which he must get Americans to buy into if he is to win in November. ""We cannot let this evil continue,"" Trump said in Florida on Monday after the capture of a US naturalized citizen of Afghan descent suspected of planting a series of bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, and the stabbing of nine people in a separate attack in a Minnesota mall on Saturday in an attack claimed by ISIS. ""If you chose Donald Trump, these problems are going to go away."" Still -- Trump's hard bore approach does carry risks. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is also maneuvering in the wake of the attacks, portraying herself as the kind of steely and calm commander-in-chief Americans traditionally turn to in times of crisis. ""I know how to do this,"" Clinton said at an airport news conference on Monday. Trump is presenting the attacks as the result of what he says are lax, weak anti-terrorism policies pursued by President Barack Obama and his Democratic foe Clinton while she was secretary of state. And he's offering a solution: that the new threat of homegrown Islamic terrorism could be snuffed out if only the United States adopted the kind of ""extreme"" vetting of foreigners and drastic changes to the immigration system that he proposed and which lit a fire under his presidential campaign. ""Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores, and it's already happening,"" Trump said Monday. ""Let me state very clearly, immigration security is national security."" Trump is also likely to seize on the fact that Ahmad Khan Rahami, the accused New York bomber, a US naturalized citizen of Afghan descent, had spent time in Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent years to renew his call for a halt on immigration to the US from nations with proven links to terrorism. Though Trump's plans might not have prevented Rahami from visiting South Asia, where thousands of law abiding US citizens travel every month, Rahami's travels will play into the febrile political atmosphere that Trump is trying to tap into following the attacks. And revelations Monday that at least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted US citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report, will be used by critics of the immigration system to bolster his claims of the need for reform. Trump's tough response to the terror attacks is likely to be a hit with his faithful supporters who have responded to such a message before -- for instance after attacks in Paris, San Bernardino California and Orlando which helped to shape the Republican primary process. But it's a gamble because while some Americans like the tough talk, he risks exacerbating impressions that with his vehement response to terrorist attacks, he is exhibiting the deficiencies that have many other voters wondering whether he is fit to be president. It's also unclear whether the limited human toll of the weekend's attacks will dilute their impact on an election still 49 days away -- in an election season in which the narrative often seems to shift by the hour. For instance, the huge campaign controversies of recent days -- Trump's false claim that Clinton was to blame for accusations that Obama was not born in the United States and the Democratic nominee's health issues dominated campaign conversation for days last week -- but barely got a mention on Monday. Voters also appear conflicted on the how national security will factor into the election. A CNN/ORC poll this month showed that voters trust the Republican more to tackle terrorism, by 51% to 45%. But the same survey found that voters think Clinton has the superior temperament required of a president (56% to 36%) and is better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief (50% to 45%). Trump's potential temperamental vulnerability came into focus during his Florida rally, when he bemoaned the medical treatment offered to Rahami after he was injured in a shootout with police. ""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said. But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Clinton supporter, pointed out that what Trump was proposing was a wholesale repudiation of the humanitarian, civic and legal values for which the US stands -- a factor that could give some voters pause when they consider handing the White House to Trump."" ""Welcome to America,"" Cuomo told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We have a system of jurisprudence, you are innocent until you proven guilty, you have a right to counsel, you have a right to hospitalization if you are ill. That is our system and it's what makes this country special. And what makes this country great."" The Clinton campaign, for its part, has long believed that in the unwanted circumstances of an ""October Surprise"" terror attack, voters would turn to experience and a steady hand rather than Trump's more impulsive leadership. ""I have sat at that table in the Situation Room, I have analyzed the threats, I have contributed to actions that have neutralized our enemies. I know how to do this,"" Clinton said during her news conference. While Trump responded to the fears of Americans, Clinton issued a call to their intellect. ""We should also launch an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out. We need to work more closely with Silicon Valley and other partners to counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment efforts online,"" Clinton said, repeating policies she has long embraced. ",1,0,0
951,"ELIZABETH, N.J. — A suspicious device found in a trash can near a train station exploded early Monday as a bomb squad was attempting to disarm it with a robot, officials said. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said the FBI was working to disarm one of five devices found in the same bag in a trash can by two men at around 8:30 p.m. Sunday near the Elizabeth train station. The men had reported seeing wires and a pipe coming out of the package, Bollwage said. Story Continued Below There was no immediate report of injuries or damage. The mayor warned that other explosions were expected. FBI agents and police converged on an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant near the train station before 6 a.m. Monday, but it was not clear whether their search of the dwelling was connected to the explosion. New Jersey Transit service trains resumed service on the Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line at 5:30 a.m. Monday, but they faced residual delays because service was suspended after the devices were found. Amtrak was operating on a modified schedule. Train passengers reported being stuck on Amtrak and NJ Transit trains for hours Sunday night, while some trains moved in reverse to let passengers off at other stations. Amtrak said 2,400 passengers were affected and trains were being brought in to other stations for people to get other transportation. It wasn't clear when the Elizabeth station would be open, a threat to cause major issues on the Monday morning commute into New York. The discovery of the suspicious package came a day after an explosion in Manhattan injured 29 people, and an unexploded pressure-cooker device was found four blocks away in New York City. Also Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded about an hour from the Elizabeth train station in Seaside Park, New Jersey, forcing the cancellation of a military charity 5K run. Officials said it didn't appear that those two incidents were connected, though they weren't ruling anything out. Investigators didn't immediately comment on whether they thought the Elizabeth incident was connected to either of the two blasts. Bollwage said that he wasn't willing to say that Elizabeth had become a target and that it was possible that someone worried about the authorities was trying to get rid of the package. ""I'm extremely concerned for the residents of the community, but more importantly extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it,"" Bollwage said. ""You have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.""",1,0,0
364,"(CNN)A group of 375 ""concerned"" scientists -- including famed physicist Stephen Hawking -- released an open letter Tuesday sharply criticizing Donald Trump, citing the threat of climate change and blasting his push for the US to leave the Paris Accord. ""It is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. You are on your own,'"" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org. The use of the term ""Parexit"" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, commonly called the ""Brexit."" They continued, ""The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the United States."" The letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including Hawking and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, who served as Secretary of Energy under President Barack Obama. CNN reached out to the Trump campaign for a response to the letter, but did not immediately receive a response. The Paris Agreement was reached by 195 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, aimed at coordinating global efforts to combat climate change. Obama was a main proponent of the agreement, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supports its ongoing implementation. The group slammed politicians who deny the existence of man-made climate change. ""During the presidential primary campaign, claims were made that the Earth is not warming, or that warming is due to purely natural causes outside human control. Such claims are inconsistent with reality,"" they wrote. Republican nominee Donald Trump opposes the agreement, and he has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax ""created by and for the Chinese."" He recently said in an interview that ""I am not a great believer in man-made climate change."" ",1,0,0
933,"Usually, nobody says Trump is ready for battle louder than Trump’s senior advisor Rudy Giuliani, but after his candidate suffered a bruising defeat last night at the hands of Hillary Clinton’s, the histrionic former New York Mayor had a different solution for his fact-less Republican nominee. Giuliani knows that the racist Republican nominee cannot possibly win any debate involving facts, so he told NBC what he’d do if possible: “If I were Donald Trump I wouldn’t participate in another debate unless I was promised that a journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker.” That’s right. Trump should drop out of the debates because facts are hard. The Hill reported specifically that the former prosecutor Giuliani was most upset over Lester Holt’s accurate fact check (that even NYPD agreed with) that “stop and frisk,” as practiced under his watch in New York, was definitively declared unconstitutional by a judge: “If journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about,” Giuliani said. “It is not unconstitutional and Trump’s description of that case was correct.” When the two tangled, it was always about the facts, and each time Lester Holt stood solely on the sturdiest ground. Republicans aren’t enamored with facts, and often try to pretend recorded statements don’t exist, so it wasn’t surprising that Giuliani tried to backtrack instantly to NBC. After realizing that he’d just made “Spin Room” headlines, he said “I did not say what I’m advising, I’m saying what I would do. Whatever advice I give to Donald Trump, I’ll give to Donald Trump.” Lester Holt did an acceptable job as moderator last night, upsetting partisans on both sides while managing not to blow any key moments with odd remarks or lasting moments of shame. The Republican nominee made several desperate “hail mary throw” sales pitches to the American people last night, but outside of his base it played disastrously.  ",0,1,0
1019,"Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years. Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out. Story Continued Below “Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.” The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.” “We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added. Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday. “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.” But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe. “I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.” What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said. As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”",1,0,0

Trump trails Clinton by just four percentage points, 46 percent to 42 percent, among likely voters nationwide in the poll released Monday afternoon. That four-point advantage is down from the seven-point edge Clinton enjoyed in the previous Monmouth poll, released in August. Story Continued Below The four-way poll also included Libertarian Gary Johnson, who polled at 8 percent among likely voters, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein, who polled at 2 percent with that group. Ahead of Monday night’s debate, 75 percent of those polled said they intend to watch, although just 12 percent said it is either “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that the debate will have an impact on which candidate they support. Eighty-seven percent of respondents said there is no chance that the debate will affect their support for a particular candidate. On the question of which major-party candidate possesses the correct temperament to be president, those polled favored Clinton (58 percent) over Trump (35 percent). But respondents were split equally at 48 percent between the two candidates when asked which would better handle the issue of the economy and jobs. Respondents were similarly split on the issue of terrorism on U.S. soil, with 48 percent favoring Clinton and 45 percent picking Trump. The Monmouth University poll was conducted from Sept. 22-25 via landlines and cell phones, reaching 802 registered voters with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.5 percent.

261,"Washington (CNN)At least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted US citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report. The failure occurred, in part, because older fingerprint records were not digitized as part of DHS or the FBI fingerprint databases and therefore could not be readily searched thereby preventing those who had been ordered deported or removed from being identified. The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report said there are still ""about 148,000 older fingerprint records that have not been digitized of aliens with final deportation orders or who are criminals or fugitives."" Failure to digitize these records risks ""making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain US citizenship fraudulently,"" the report added. ""US Citizenship and Immigration Services granted US citizenship to at least 858 individuals from special interest countries who had been ordered deported or removed under another name,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report. The report describes special interest countries as ""generally defined as countries that are of concern to the national security of the United States."" At least one of the people identified as having improperly been granted citizenship is now working in law enforcement, the report said. It recommends the remaining older fingerprint records be digitized and that DHS review ""the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal deportation orders under a different identity"" and decide whether to seek denaturalization. The report noted that the department has concurred with its recommendations and has begun implementing corrective actions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Neema Hakim told CNN that ""DHS is and has been taking steps to address this issue"" including working to digitize the 1990s-era fingerprint records. But Hakim added, ""The fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently."" ""Where the DHS review process finds that naturalization was obtained fraudulently, DHS will appropriately refer the case to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal proceedings, including for denaturalization,"" Hakim said. ""This failure represents a significant risk to America's national security as these naturalized individuals have access to serve in positions of public trust and the ability to obtain security clearances,"" Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote in an open letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. Failure to properly screen applicants for US citizenship, particularly from ""special interest countries,"" is likely to further fuel controversy over the screening of immigrants, a contentious topic during the 2016 election cycle. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for immigration bans targeted at countries with connections to terrorism. He had previously called for a temporary prohibition of Muslim immigrants. The apprehension of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspected perpetrator of the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, is similarly likely to draw attention to the screening process as Rahami immigrated to the US from Afghanistan and subsequently was granted US citizenship.

925,"Democratic President Barack Obama pulled off a historic diplomatic coup when he engineered an accord with Iran to freeze their nuclear program for ten years in exchange for lifting the sanctions that had been strangling their economy. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton engineered the tough economic sanctions that dragged Iran to the negotiating table after ex-Vice President Dick Cheney rebuffed their efforts at negotiation, convincing countries like China and Russia to act in unison with the United States and against their own short term business interests. It was a major diplomatic accomplishment and made our world safer. Did Trump just say US gave Iran $150 billion? Did I really hear that? — Arash Karami (@thekarami) September 27, 2016  Republican nominee Donald Trump keeps spewing complete fabrications about the  Iran accords which President Obama concluded at the start of this year. He started by repeating the lie Fox News planted about America paying $400 million dollars of Iran’s own cash back to them, at the conclusion of the agreements. It was money America owed Iran under a legal agreement. The State Department returned $400 million to the Iranian government, but it was money that we owed them. We didn’t “give” them anything. In the 1970s, the United States made a deal to sell $400 million of fighter jets to the Shah of Iran. The Shah paid upfront but was then deposed in the Iranian revolution, so the United States never delivered the jets. As part of the nuclear disarmament deal, the Iranian government simple wanted their money back if we weren’t going to cough up the jets. In Trump’s mind, that money inflated to $150 billion. Cash to paid to Iran as part of the lifting of sanctions rises from $400million to $1.5 billion to $150 billion according to Trump. #debates — Albert Rapacioli (@speedlinefoto) September 27, 2016  Bingo!

No word on whether next week it will be the ISIS flag or not, but it wouldn’t surprise me at this point. So, now our schools of so-called higher education are teaching that a terrorist group that pushes violence and racism should be respected as much as the American flag and our Founding Fathers. That is just obscene in the extreme. If this is symbolic support of their community, I want no part of any of them.  From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world… The University of Vermont this week flew the “Black Lives Matter” terrorist flag beside the American flag on campus. This is what they are teaching America’s children today on college campuses– That a terrorist flag is to be respected and the American flag is to be disrespected. Campus Reform reported: The University of Vermont’s Burlington campus is flying a Black Lives Matter flag alongside both the American and state flags. Several students from the school took to social media to express their support for the move, with some saying the school is “winning for this” and another noting that since the school is supportive of the movement, “we should be too.” One local news outlet is reporting that the flag is being sponsored by the school’s Student Government Association (SGA), whose president called the move a way to “show symbolic support for our community.” The flag is being sponsored by the UVM Student Government Association. They should be ashamed of themselves. The flag apparently appeared on campus the day after the start of the riots in Charlotte, which have now taken one life and injured about a dozen police officers and a number of protesters. Many students at the school are saying they are happy to see the BLM flag on their campus, with some even saying they would like to see the flag stay up on campus “forever.” I guess I should not be surprised. Vermont is uber liberal. Not everyone thought it was keen… “The university is known for being very liberal, but this statement of support for Black Lives Matter goes beyond anything that can be excused,” one student, who did not wish to be identified, told Campus Reform. “A public university, funded by the taxpayers…has no right to make such a blatant political statement.

555,"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, who is currently facing felony charges for fraud, is trying to solicit donations online to fund her legal defense. Brown, who currently represents Florida’s 5th congressional district, was indicted in July on more than 20 counts of fraud. According to federal prosecutors, Brown and a collaborator presented the non-profit One Door for Education as a scholarship fund, but instead used its finances as a personal slush fund. Brown supposedly used the money to pay off back taxes and fund public events honoring herself. Despite raising $800,000, One Door awarded only a single $1,000 scholarship. Brown’s political fortunes have collapsed since the indictment, but she has refused to give in. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and has refused to resign her seat even after losing the Democratic primary in August. Now, Brown launched another fundraising campaign, trying to convince supporters they should fund her criminal defense. On the page for the Corrine Brown Legal Expense Trust, Brown argues that she is being prosecuted by sinister forces who want to bring down a powerful black woman. (Indicted Dem Congresswoman Compares Her Ordeal To Dallas Shooting) “During my entire political career, I have fought racism, injustice and advocated for individuals who normally get left behind,” the page says. “It should come as no surprise that some took offense to my efforts to stand up for you.” The page touts Brown’s various political deeds during her congressional career, such as increasing the amount of gas tax money returned to Florida, getting Congressional Gold Medals for the first black members of the Marine Corps, and fighting against “stand your ground” gun laws. A lack of money isn’t the only problem with Brown’s defense.

No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely,” Trump says. The ad finishes by quoting Trump from another appearance on Stern’s radio show in 1993. Stern, who does not appear on camera, asks Trump “so you treat women with respect?” “No, I can’t say that either,” Trump replies.",1,0,0
533,"Melbourne, Florida (CNN)Donald Trump argued Tuesday that the controversial stop-and-frisk policing tactic once employed in New York City is constitutional, adding that it would ""overwhelmingly"" save African-American and Hispanic lives. The practice, however, has been criticized as racial profiling that unfairly targeted those very minority groups. Trump quibbled with debate moderator Lester Holt on Monday night after Holt pointed out that the stop-and-frisk practice as implemented in New York City was ruled unconstitutional. ""I explained last night that stop-and-frisk is constitutional,"" Trump said at a Florida rally, speaking of a back-and-forth he had with debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News during Monday night's presidential debate. While stop-and-frisk policies are used in various US cities, the aggressive implementation of stop-and-frisk in New York was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013, who said the policy violated the rights of minorities who were disproportionately targeted. ""Stop, question and frisk"" remains a policing practice in New York, but has been dramatically reined in. But Trump pressed the issue even as he continued to make entreaties to African-American voters. ""A policy like stop-and-frisk could save thousands of lives in a city like Chicago, just like it saved thousands of lives in New York. Overwhelmingly, this will save African-American and Hispanic lives -- citizens who are entitled to the same protections as every American,"" Trump said. ""I say this to African-American communities. What do you have to lose? Donald Trump is going to fix it. We'll fix it. We're going to make it safe,"" he added. Trump then ticked down a list of crime statistics, pointing in particular to the more than 3,000 shootings that have taken place in Chicago just this year. ""I will never back down -- and that's true, Obama's hometown -- I will never back down from trying to save American lives,"" Trump said, pointing out that Chicago is the hometown of President Barack Obama.

1288,"Hillary Clinton didn't hold back in her attacks on Donald Trump Monday night, but Donald Trump intimated that he pulled a key punch — passing on making a reference to Bill Clinton's past infidelities. “I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” Trump said in reply. “It's inappropriate. It's not nice.” Story Continued Below Trump's veiled reference followed a tough attack from Clinton, who referenced his past comments about women being “pigs” and “dogs” and said Trump “loves hanging around beauty contests” during Monday night’s debate. “He tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,” Clinton said. Trump also said that Clinton has been hitting him “with tremendous commercials. Some of it's in entertainment.” Trump added that Rosie O’Donnell, the focus of some of his comments has “been very tough to me.” Clinton has spent “hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads ... many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,” Trump added. “I’m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,” Trump told reporters after the debate. “Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn’t want to say what I was going to say.” And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be? “I’ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we’ll see,” he responded.",1,0,0

George Soros has been funding leftist groups for decades, from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter. Rumors of voter fraud have followed him for a long time and it appears that he’s gearing up to do it again. A new campaign has debuted that claims it will end Trump’s campaign. Called the “October surprise that will end Trump,” the campaign says it will activate a “secret swing state” of over 8 million unregistered voters abroad, made up of both American expats and “global citizens.”  The 8 million Americans abroad almost never vote.

The activists behind the campaign drove from University College London to Parliament in an open top bus, blasting Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA” while yelling “Don’t vote Trump!”.   It is illegal in the United States for registered charities to work with or for any presidential candidate, and Avaaz denies having any connection to the Hillary Clinton campaign.

730,"Adam Walinsky once worked for President John F. Kennedy. He wrote speeches for Bobby (RFK) Kennedy, and Bill Clinton once worked on his National Committee for the Police Corps. He is a longtime Democrat operative, politician, and leader, and in a recent article for Politico, Walinsky shocked the nation when he announced that he would be voting for Donald Trump on November 8th. I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. The question many are asking today is, why? Why would a long-time and highly respected Democrat defect at such a crucial time in our history? Why would Walinsky abandon the most establishment-friendly candidate in recent memory, to vote for a Republican outsider who eschews much of the Democrat Party platform. So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Walinsky focused on one key aspect of the campaign – foreign policy: Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. Walinsky hammers one key area of today’s Democrat Party that many libertarians and some conservatives have decried for years. The Democrat Party is the party of hypocrisy when it comes to war and foreign policy. The very same people who for years marched against war during the Bush administration, have fallen silent during the Obama years. This reality is stunning, considering that President Obama has led us through 8 years of constant warfare (numbers below accurate as of May 2016): —2,499 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq so far under President Obama, according to the independent Iraq Coalition Casualty Count. —Of those, 1,906 have been killed in and around Afghanistan, and 593 in Iraq. —Under Obama, the United States has been at war for 2,687 days. That’s longer than under George W. Bush — or any other U.S. president, for that matter. —Obama has conducted airstrikes on seven countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. (That’s three more countries than George W. Bush bombed.) —U.S. combat forces are deployed on the ground in three countries: Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. That’s one more war than Obama inherited, and which his successor will likely have to contend with.  Because of these truths and the reality that much of Obama’s foreign policy vision was crafted, developed, and carried out by Hillary Clinton, have led Walinsky to the realization that Donald Trump may be the most likely candidate to bring peace to our nation. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election… Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. I urge you to read all of Walinsky’s well-crafted argument in support of Donald Trump. He delivers paragraphs of excoriating commentary against the Democrat Party, while explaining why, despite his faults, Donald Trump may indeed be the man for this moment. If you believe America is starved for change, and many voters do, then the only candidate who offers any hope of real change is Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton not only represents “more of the same” from Washington, D.C., she is the progenitor, and an ardent supporter of many of our worst, most ineffective policies, ideas, and plans. Voting against Clinton doesn’t only mean voting for change; it means voting against some of our worst political failures of the last 30 years.

1096,"Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged. “If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.” Story Continued Below Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.” Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii. Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked. But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.” On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.” Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism. Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S. “I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.” He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said. “I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.",1,0,0
1624,"On the topic of climate change, Hillary Clinton seems more knowledgeable of Donald Trump’s words than he does. Earlier in Monday night’s presidential debate at Hofstra University, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pointed out that the GOP nominee previously said that climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese. Trump immediately responded, saying, “I did not. I do not say that.” But in 2012, long before he was running for the White House, Trump tweeted that exact statement. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J.

221,"In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldnât stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)? Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs. Dean, who is now a contributor forÂ MSNBC, tweeted last night: Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? â Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016 Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system. And considering he hasnât released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state. Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be. Deanâs assertion is just that â an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made againstÂ candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything sheâs not. If this debate showed one thing, itâs that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is. ",0,1,0

The man thinks he has jokes, but after the joke he just told, someone needs to grab us a whole lot of rotten veggies…to throw at this horrid President.

Now people think this joke was horrid for many different reasons. One, of course is because in the same day there were 2 explosions in the U.S. caused by bombs, and a horrid stabbing after someone shouted out two words… any guesses? “Allah Akbar!” of course… However, I think in addition to that…the man is the President of the United States. As such, I just plain expect better character from him. Maybe I’m old school, but if he is really relieved about the ‘birther’ thing being ‘over’ …. why is he talking about it, even if it’s by joke?

189,"It’s no secret that Russia is very pro-Donald Trump, and Donald Trump is extremely pro-Russia. His policies align with Russia’s Christmas list, and he hired – for a campaign manager – a man who benefited heavily from pro-Russian monies during the Ukrainian conflict. In fact, the ties between Paul Manafort and Russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign, prompting many questions to be raised. The Trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time. But, as usual, they were wrong. On Friday, it was a announced that U.S. intelligence officials are investigating Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, for alleged ties to Russia. Intelligence officials have reason to believe that Page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top Russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted. According to Yahoo News, which first broke the story: The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page, who has extensive business interests in Russia, have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election, the sources said. After one of those briefings, Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and “high ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow over the summer as evidence of “significant and disturbing ties” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau. The reports apparently had some members of Congress “taken aback,” due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties. Congressional members, which includes California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only U.S.-Russian relations, but undercut foreign policy and even the November presidential election. Page is a former banker who worked for Merrill Lynch and is based in Moscow, giving him strong ties with rich and influential Russian officials. In fact, one of Page’s business buddies is especially problematic for American diplomacy and international law: But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip, Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian’s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine. So now that that the Trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady Russian ties, they did what they know best: they lied. Page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump since March. In August, Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for the campaign, confirmed that Carter was an adviser. Now? Communications director Jason Miller told The Hill that Page is “not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign.” So which is it? The campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that Page is in fact an adviser, and now their communications director says he’s not nor has he ever been. It’s becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the Trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin and Putin’s rich, thuggish buddies. But no, let’s continue to talk about Hillary Clinton’s pneumonia, because that’s way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates. ",0,1,0
676,"Scroll down for video For those folks paying close attention to the national news, this last year has perhaps been an awakening for many, and no doubt a disappointment for some, as to how our judicial system really works, in that although we’d like to think that “justice is blind” or that there’s “equal justice under the law” in reality there are two distinct and different although parallel systems at work within America. One for us ordinary folks, and another for those political elites, which we seldom get to see, because for the most their malfeasance is usually covered-up and committed by politicians, who for the most part are lawyers, who become judges, who become prosecutors, and who eventually become president, in short a “sheepskin” for some is a legal license to steal, which of course is on full display this election season with Hillary Clinton and her gang. However as this Las Vegas Public Defender found out, wearing a “Black Lives Matter” button into a courtroom isn’t exactly the smartest thing to do, in that she doesn’t belong to the Political VIP Lounge, and of course what transpired next, was a visible clash of cultures taking place right there within the courtroom, as District Judge Douglas Herndon ordered attorney Erika Ballou to remove the button.  “I took an oath to support the Constitution, all of the Constitution,” Ballou said. “My oath is to protect everyone’s free speech, even if I disagree with it. I am not comfortable giving my case to someone else to handle. And I’m also not comfortable abridging my free speech.” She then acknowledged she would not remove the button and wanted another judge to hear the case, which of course Herndon refused to recuse himself. “We’re not here on a petition about a movement or a protest or anything like that,” Herndon said. “We’re here to dispense justice on a criminal calendar of cases. And that’s why I think it’s inappropriate.” One wonders what the reaction of Attorney Ballou would be if a defendant that she was tasked to represent, walked into court wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt, and would she be as adamant in protecting that person’s free speech? Judge Herndon said, “I’m asking the same things of them that I ask of anybody else. Please leave any kind of political or opinion protest statements outside the courtroom.”  The police union’s new executive director, Steve Grammas, sent a letter which objected to “attorneys and other citizens who display ‘Black Lives Matter’ propaganda in court.” “We have received complaints from our member officers who believe that such displays have no place in courtrooms in which justice is to be dispensed,” the letter read. “We are certain that the courts would not allow similar public displays from citizens who believe that killers should be sentenced to death or that sexual predators should be castrated.” Here is the letter in it's entirety: Ltr to Chief Judge David Barker by Las Vegas Review-Journal on Scribd  ",0,0,1
224,"Following the presidential debate, Donald Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson opened her mouth on CBS and stupidity just flowed out of it. Pierson was on the show to discuss Donald Trump’s debate performance on Monday. When Trump wasn’t sniffling, he was interrupting Hillary Clinton. Naturally, Pierson blamed Hillary Clinton for Donald Trump touting the stop-and-frisk policy, which by the way, was ruled unconstitutional in 2013. During the post-debate panel, Pierson was asked to comment on Donald Trump’s recent proposal to get more cities to adopt the kind of stop-and-frisk policy in New York that was found unconstitutional back in 2013. As a shock to no one ever, Rudy Giuliani, a huge Trump supporter, is and was a proponent of the racist policy. Pierson took another route and blamed Clinton, because of course: “In responding, Pierson said that stop-and-frisk was effective at stopping crime and was not really racist — but then she blamed Hillary Clinton for stop-and-frisk being necessary because of her own racism.” “It actually did work in New York,” Pierson said of the stop-and-frisk policy. “But we have to get down to why, because that’s why we’re here today. We have two candidates who have very different views. The reason why we have this problem, the reason why stop-and-frisk was implemented, was there were disparities with regard to who people were pulling over,” she continued. She went on to say: “And it’s profiling, criminal profiling, not necessarily racial profiling, even though it comes across that way. But the reason why we had it was that we had the First Lady of the United States who went out on the national stage and dehumanized young black children… this has been the conditioning of the American public where black children have been demonized, Hillary Clinton owns that.” Watch:  In late August, Trump tweeted, “How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth “SUPER PREDATORS” – Has she apologized?” Yes, Hillary Clinton made the “super predators” remark more than 20 years ago, but it was not directed toward African-American children. This is nothing new for Pierson. Just last month, she blamed President Obama for Iraq war deaths in 2004. ",0,1,0
803,"Warning, Muslims, if you want to chant “Allah” over and over on a plane, there might be repercussions! Faisal Ali and his wife, Nazia had boarded a Cincinnati bound Delta Air Lines flight in Paris, France. The plane sat on the tarmac for about 45 minutes. During that time, several flight attendants noticed that the husband was sweating, hiding his phone, and that both he and his wife were chanting “Allah” repeatedly. It made the flight attendants uncomfortable, reports the Independent UK. One of the flight crew (after having cleared it with the captain) approached the couple, and told them to gather their belongings as they would have to exit the plane over “safety” concerns. Faisal’s wife, Nazia, can be seen in this cell phone video becoming combative, asking if it’s about “discrimination.”  A person who appears to be the captain tells Nazia that it’s a “safety of flight issue.” Mad World News reports that, When the Alis exited, a French police officer was waiting for them outside the gate and an airline worker was carefully reviewing their passports. The couple went through a brief interrogation process and they were okayed for release. It was then that the Delta employee explained that the pilot had made the decision to kick them off the flight because crew members noticed their particularly strange behavior and felt “uncomfortable.” The couple was promptly booked on another flight and sent home and has now offered them a refund as a gesture of good will. Of course, this wasn’t enough to satisfy their entitlement. The inconvenience caused by their unconventional behavior was seen by them as being nothing less than a case of “Islamophobia.” So, the couple immediately called the terror-tied, Saudi-funded Council on American-Islamic Relations to whine about their alleged persecution. CAIR is accusing the airline of repeated profiling of Muslim passengers, and, if this is true, Delta is probably one of the safest airlines to fly. Because France is suffering from a constant barrage of Islamic terrorist attacks, they are taking measures to prevent Muslims from killing their citizens. Personally, I applaud the flight attendants and the captain. Muslims can scream “Discrimination!” all they want. If you’re acting suspicious, you Will be removed from a flight, especially with all of the terror attacks that have been happening as of late. The flight crew was acting out of fear for their, and their passenger’s safety. Imagine if the couple Were terrorists. They could’ve taken the plane down, killing hundreds on board. Safety first, as they say. The hell with your feelings about being “discriminated” against. People want to LIVE, and not be attacked by terrorist scum.  Did the flight crew make the right decision?

1528,"An Ohio judge ordered an attorney jailed for five days after she refused to remove a Black Lives Matter pin she wore to court. The lawyer is appealing the case.   Attorney Andrea Burton of Youngstown, Ohio, was charged with contempt of court and given a five-day jail sentence on July 22 after she refused to take off the pin at Judge Robert Milich's request, the New York Daily News reported. The judge reportedly called Burton, who was representing a client at the time, into his chambers and spoke privately to her about the matter. When the lawyer continued to wear the pin, he adjourned the proceedings and ordered her to be held on a contempt charge. Milich told WKBN he made his ruling based on Supreme Court precedent that allows judges to prohibit political expression in courtrooms.  “There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue,” Milich said. The judge claimed his decision was not influenced by his own personal views. ""A judge doesn't support either side,"" he told WKBN. ""A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law."" Burton has been released pending an appeal on the condition that she refrain from wearing any items that make a political statement in court. If she loses the appeal, she will have to serve five days in jail. The attorney told New York Daily News that her constitutional right to free speech superseded Supreme Court case law and the judge's discretion. “It's an act of civil disobedience, I understand that,"" Burton told NY Daily News. ""I’m not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don’t all matter equally, and that’s the problem in the justice system."" Mike Brickner, the senior policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said that judges are generally given a wide latitude in what they allow or don't allow in the courtroom, although their decisions must be reasonable and fairly applied. ""There have been cases in the past when people have been given contempt of court for refusing to comply with a judge's order to remove an article of clothing that may have a message on it,"" Brickner wrote in a July 22 email to WKBN. ""Many times this has been done to retain the defendant’s right to a fair trial.""  Sources: New York Daily News, WKBN / Photo credit: WFMJ via New York Daily News",0,0,1
844,"Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life. On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God. For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary. He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength. “In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.” It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing. Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country. Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root. So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith… Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes. With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious. Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep. Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad? There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening. …and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth. ",0,0,1
1323,"At last night’s debate, Donald Trump said he provided a “great service” for President Obama by getting him to produce his birth certificate. He said Hillary Clinton lacks the stamina to serve as president. When Clinton suggested he hasn’t released his tax returns because he doesn’t pay any taxes to the federal government, he did not respond with a denial: “It would be squandered, believe me.” And during a back-and-forth about his racial views, Trump said he deserves “great credit” for refusing to discriminate at one golf club he owns—when he owns seven U.S. golf clubs. It’s hard to think of another year when those jaw-dropping statements in front of a massive audience wouldn’t have been big news. Then again, Trump also suggested the hack of the Democratic National Committee, which security experts blame on Russia, might have been perpetrated by “somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.” He accused Clinton of having some kind of meltdown “at the AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don’t know who you were talking to, but you were totally out of control.” He insisted that blowing up an Iranian ship would not start a war. And when Clinton complained that he would soon blame her for everything that has ever happened, he responded: “Why not?” Story Continued Below The question, of course, is whether any of these he-said-what? moments on the world’s largest stage will hurt Trump. And after 15 months of his brazen assaults on political norms, the only honest answer is: Who the hell knows? The two candidates on stage last night basically inhabited two different rhetorical universes, just as they have on the campaign trail. Clinton stuck to her public persona as a politics-as-usual Democrat with five-point policy plans and canned talking points about “Trumped-up trickle-down economics.” And Trump continued to flout political customs—he tried to interrupt 25 times in the first 26 minutes of the debate, according to Vox—and say a lot of wild, perplexing and untrue things that may well overstimulate the national fact-checking economy. Clinton clearly seemed better prepared and more coherent last night, and moderator Lester Holt’s questions—nothing about immigration, Benghazi or the Clinton Foundation, and her deleted emails barely came up—may have played to her wonky strengths. Trump came off as an overconfident blowhard, the mouthy guy at the office meeting who never knew much about the topic, didn’t try to get himself up to speed in advance, interrupts all his female colleagues anyway, then tells them to wait until he’s done when they try to get a word in edgewise. Trump did put Clinton on the defensive over trade issues, and especially in the early minutes, he scored points portraying her as a tired politician who had stayed in the game too long. But he did seem a lot less comfortable and more agitated than he does at his rallies, as if mass adulation suits him better than one-on-one confrontation, and it did sound like the pundits—and the battleground focus groups—scored the contest as a victory for Clinton. She didn't seem like the candidate who was totally out of control. Beyond the style points, though, there does not seem to be a lot of recognition of just how remarkable some of Trump’s comments were. Some of those comments have become familiar through repetition, like his suggestion that in America’s minority neighborhoods, you can’t walk down the street without getting shot, or his claim that American jobs are “leaving in bigger numbers than ever,” when in fact unemployment has been cut in half since 2010. But as I’ve discovered after attending Trump rallies, many of us have become so desensitized to his outrageousness that it no longer sounds as abnormal as it is. After all, his political incorrectness has become central to his brand; his supporters love that he isn’t afraid to say publicly things other politicians wouldn’t dare say privately. And whenever he drops a bombshell, he usually drops several more before we’ve recognized just how explosive the last one was. For example, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is widely considered one of the least political people in Washington, but it barely seemed to register last night when Trump accused her of keeping monetary policy loose for purely political reasons—even though the policy should presumably be even looser if the economy were really in the shambles Trump says it is. Trump also casually suggested that Obama will “spend the rest of his life on the golf course” after leaving office, a pretty disrespectful thing to say about a president, though obviously not as disrespectful as arguing that Trump did him a favor by spreading lies about his citizenship. Trump also tried to push the preposterous notion that Clinton was a fervent birther, but a less effective one than Trump, sounding like Mitt Romney would have if Romney had suggested Obama was a less effective governor of Massachusetts. And it was really odd to see a 70-year-old man whose latest doctor’s note revealed that he’s flirting with obesity attack the physical condition of his opponent. Modern presidential candidates just haven’t said things like that. Then again, modern presidential candidates have always released their tax returns, which Trump has steadfastly refused to do, citing an audit that, as Clinton and Holt both pointed out, is not a valid reason to avoid disclosure. Clinton then pointed out that Trump didn’t pay any federal income tax in the years he had to release his returns to casino regulators, a swipe that Trump could have easily ignored. Instead, he interrupted her to boast: “That makes me smart.” And when Clinton insinuated that maybe he still isn’t paying the federal taxes that support troops, schools and health care, he again took the bait, not to deny that he’s a free rider, but to scoff that his taxes would just be wasted if he did pay them. That was a pretty damning non-denial. But before that could sink in Clinton was attacking him for stiffing his workers—“dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers like my dad.” And Trump once again embraced the charge, explaining that he doesn’t pay when he isn’t satisfied, and recommending that the country take a similar approach to its debts. When Clinton pointed out that it would be a disaster if the country declared bankruptcy the way Trump’s companies have, he said he had just taken advantage of the laws for his own benefit, because “that’s what I do.” It’s hard to imagine another presidential candidate saying that, but then again, it’s hard to imagine another presidential candidate expecting brownie points for allowing blacks in his club. Trump also defended his sexist comments about Rosie O'Donnell, described the $14 million his father gave him at the outset of his career as ""a very small loan,"" and undoubtedly made other incendiary comments I missed. Somehow, that kind of rhetoric seems to be baked into the Trump cake. He denied last night that he had ever called global warming a Chinese hoax, even though the evidence remains on his Twitter account. He also clung to his disproven claim that he always opposed the war in Iraq, citing Sean Hannity as his character witness. Trump just keeps blustering through, never admitting error, always assuming his confidence projects authority. And maybe it does. He’s in a tight race to be president of the United States. Trump’s appeal is not really about details, which makes it complicated for the media to cover him. Maybe it’s tendentious to fact-check his exaggerations and rehash his rhetorical flourishes when he’s really trying to convey a larger truth. Like when he hits her for being a career politician by claiming she’s been “fighting ISIS your entire adult life.” But when you look at the transcript of, say, last night’s contentious discussion about race, it’s hard not to think that he’s getting a bit of a pass. I couldn’t help but think last night about all the abuse and ridicule heaped on Vice President Al Gore during a fundraising scandal when he kept saying there was “no controlling legal authority” banning his actions. When Clinton pointed out that the Justice Department sued Trump’s company in the 1970s for refusing to rent to blacks, Trump pointed out that lots of companies were sued, and that his settled with “no admission of guilt.” And then he said it again, after complaining that Clinton mentioned the suit in ads. “Frankly, I look at that, and I say, isn’t that amazing?” Trump said. “Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt…It’s just one of those things.” It’s one of those things that won’t make the news tomorrow, even though “no admission of guilt” at least partially captures the Trump approach to politics. He’s going to keep saying things that normal politicians don’t. He won’t apologize for them. He’ll attack the media for even questioning them. And his supporters will continue to love him for them.",1,0,0
541,"Donald Trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president. Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see what it has to do with being president. Mark Mellman made these observations “…a crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy.” This is why we are looking at character in the first place, so we do not look at failed policies. Dr. Frank said, “Most of my colleagues feel that he’s not crazy, and if he is crazy, he’s crazy like a fox,”. Dan P. Adams,who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly, that Donald Trump has “sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness (the extent to which a person appears to be caring, loving, affectionate, polite, and kind). Anger may be the operative emotion behind Trump’s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness. Anger can fuel malice, but it can also motivate social dominance, stoking a desire to win the adoration of others. Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker, more like Bill Clinton than Bush. Decision makers who, like Nixon, who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries.” Many other presidents ranked high in these traits. Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest, followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. Trump’s personality type is classified as a Promoter. Other non-presidents who fit this category are Ernest Hemingway, Eva Peron, Winston Churchill, Grace Slick, Madonna, George S. Patton, and Steve Jobs. “They are Bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go their way. Promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want, and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster. Because of this, they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators, and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs, able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can.” says Dan Adams, Take Andrew Jackson for example. His campaign centered on Jackson’s image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption. Strong-willed and sharp-tempered, a fierce patriot and rabid partisan, Jackson was always controversial. He personalized disputes and demonized opponents. Yet behind Jackson’s towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects. Jackson’s quick temper was notorious. His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him. Jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs. His opponents were terrified of his temper: Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. He believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people. He entered office determined to end government corruption and the nation’s financial difficulties caused, he thought, by the upper-class elite in government, business, and finance.(Taken from a variety of historical sources). Rather than disqualifying Donald Trump, his temperament may make him the most qualified. Like Andrew Jackson, we may not like him, but if we are looking for a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker,who may hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries, someone who is bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go the right way for the American people, able to take tremendous risks to get what he wants, the very best trouble-spot administrator and negotiator, able to swing deals and kick-start the economy in a way no other can, then we might have to overlook the baggage that comes with Donald Trump.

1466,"A hardworking farmer went on ABC's reality show ""Shark Tank"" to pitch his product, which simply exists to improve the lives of other farmers, and was mocked for his lack of business expertise (video below). But by the end of his pitch, he had an investor and had won over the hearts of all the sharks on the panel. Johnny Georges, a farmer and the inventor of the Tree T-Pee, brought his invention to ""Shark Tank,"" seeking an investment to help sell his product nationwide. As he explained his product to the panel of sharks and revealed that he had only sold within five counties of his Florida farm, the sharks were stunned. They began nearly mocking him for his lack of business experience and questioning how the company was expected to succeed.  Georges tried to explain that he wants to do what is right and to help other farmers, so he only makes $1 per Tree T-Pee. The judges were shocked he hadn't expanded his market or raised his prices, but he remained faithful to the greater cause. Finally, Georges' character won the hearts of the panel and John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of hair care product company Paul Mitchell, offered to give him exactly what he asked for.

66,"Hillary Clinton has added her name to the growing list of people calling on police in Charlotte to release video of the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott.  Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. -H  Clinton had initially planned to visit Charlotte on Sunday, but her campaign announced on Friday night that she was postponing her trip to the following Sunday. ""After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday's trip as to not impact the City's resources,"" communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. ""She will plan to visit Charlotte next Sunday, provided circumstances allow."" Scott was fatally shot by officers on Tuesday and police reportedly have video that shows that he was holding a gun, though it is unclear if he was pointing a gun in their direction. Scott's family has said he was holding a book, not a gun, while waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. After reviewing the footage, the family's attorney said in a statement that it's ""impossible"" to detect what Scott is holding and at no point did Scott appear or act aggressively. ""After watching the videos, the family again has more questions than answers,"" Justin Bamberg, a lawyer representing Scott's family, said in the statement Thursday. ""When told by police to exit his vehicle, Mr. Scott did so in a very calm, non-aggressive manner. While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands."" Family members were privately shown the police video, and they want it to be released publicly. Law enforcement officials have said that they intend to release the video but have not determined the appropriate timing. The city's mayor and police chief have said they believe that the video should be released but suggested that if it was released too soon it could impact the ongoing investigation. The State Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation. Scott's family released footage shot by his wife that shows his confrontation with police officers and the moments before the shooting as well as the aftermath, but it does not show the shooting itself.  We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It’s unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.   We've also seen the targeting of police officers—but so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform. ",1,0,0
1395,"Anyone who has ever struggled with some kind of addiction knows that it is not easy to break the habit. Whether you’re addicted to nicotine, alcohol, meth or crack, even being 24-hours sober seems like a monumental achievement. One woman, an ex-heroin addict, showed Reddit what happens when you decide to turn your life around and free yourself from the clutches of addiction. You can’t argue with the results, either.  Addiction is a mental, physical, emotional and spiritual event, for want of a better term. Getting sober is tough for that very reason, but it’s necessary for the well-being of everyone involved, meaning the family and friends of the addict, as well as the addict themselves. The woman in question began a downward spiral into heroin addiction after her abusive boyfriend convinced her that it would make her feel better about the problems in her life, including losing custody of her daughter. She says that after 8 months of daily use and several failed attempts at getting sober, she finally told the judge in the case that she wanted to get clean. She was found in contempt of court and went to jail for 36 days before heading to rehab. As you can see in her mugshot, this woman – who is unnamed – was feeling the physical and emotional affects of her disease. When she finally became dedicated to getting clean, her whole life changed, as is evidenced in this “after” picture, where she is 826 days sober, and counting.  She added the following to the end of her Reddit post: ‘There are other addicts out there who are in the same circle of hell that I was in in that mug shot. So even if one of those people see this and get their sh*t together, then it was worth it.’ If you or someone you know is struggling with any kind of addiction, please know that it is okay to seek out help for them. You’re not intruding on their lives and while they may be furious with you for a period of time, they will come to see that you did what you had to do to make their lives better. There is no reason that someone should have to suffer from addiction for one more day. ",0,0,1
1140,"PITTSBURGH — Attempting to strike a unifying, presidential tone while commenting Thursday about urban unrest in Charlotte, Donald Trump veered temporarily off-script and attributed the violence — without offering any evidence — to drugs. ""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television,"" he said. Story Continued Below Following a night of wall-to-wall cable coverage of the violent protests in response to another police shooting of an African-American man, the Republican presidential nominee aimed to square his law-and-order philosophy with his eleventh-hour outreach efforts to the country's African-American communities. Trump, who trails Hillary Clinton by approximately 80 percent points among African-American voters, explained that his promise to restore order to cities plagued by racial tensions is an effort to protect disproportionately affected minority communities. ""There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration,"" he said at the beginning of remarks to the Shale Insight Convention. ""Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children a great education. We have to cherish and protect those people."" Trump's stated concern is of a piece with his recent visits to African-American churches in Detroit and Flint and his stumping in Ohio Wednesday with boxing promoter Don King, who vouched for the candidate's character. But his ad-libbed comment blaming drugs for these violent uprisings seemed to validate stereotypes about black communities — seemingly supporting the criticism that Trump's larger outreach effort to African-American voters is really an attempt to convince moderate Republican women that he isn't a racist. As he often does, Trump praised police officers for risking their lives but acknowledged, as he did on Wednesday, that their judgment in pressure situations is not infallible. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed,"" Trump said. ""But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.""",1,0,0
752,"A Kansas sheriffs deputy was murdered on Sunday by illegal immigrants that had been arrested on two occasions already. The perpetrator was Adrian Espinosa-Flores who is 38 years old. He was charged on Monday with the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Allegedly, he was driving drunk and crashed his truck into a patrol car that had been stopped on the side of the road. Unfortunately the crash led to the death of Johnson County Sheriff’s Department Master Deputy Brandon Collins who was 45 years of age at the time of the accident. The Kansas City Star reported in the investigation. They reported that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement had made an immigration detainer on the suspect Espinosa-Flores. Detainers are requests that people be transferred into the custody of ICE. They are specifically made for the purposes of immigration violations. An anonymous source with inside knowledge of the investigation tipped off the media that the detainer the suspect had was because of allegations he was in the country illegally. The Johnson County District Attorney’s Office refused to answer any questions saying that it is an ongoing investigation. The suspect was arrested for DUI in 2001 and in 2013 had a traffic violation however ICE noted they had not been notified of these previous arrests. 41 Action News reported, “it could be considered profiling because a lot of people of all races are arrested without a proper ID.” People laughed Donald Trump off and called him a xenophobe when he pointed out all the people in the United States murdered by illegal immigrants. Surely, they’re not laughing now. This very sad and tragic incident proves that Trump’s comments about violent illegal immigrants is far truer than anyone would like to admit. However, come November when he builds that wall this hopefully won’t be as great of an issue anymore.   ",0,0,1
512,"New York (CNN)After 30 years in the spotlight, Hillary Clinton finally found the balance on gender that has bedeviled her throughout her career during the debate at Hofstra Monday night. Demonstrate power, command of the issues and the ability to shred your opponent -- all while seeming (just) likeable enough. Monday night's faceoff with Donald Trump could have been heralded as another historic first for women. But Clinton made no mention of a glass ceiling. There was no self-congratulatory nod to the fact that she was the first female nominee of a major party to take that stage before as many as 100 million people. She wore red, a power color, but with a feminine cut that looked anything but severe. She was smooth and measured; flicking subtly to her gender with a quick mention of granddaughter Charlotte right off the top, but then didn't dwell on it. She didn't lecture. She smiled (a lot) — even as he slid into his role of interrupter-in-chief. Before Monday night's debate, all the attention was on which Donald Trump would appear -- the restrained candidate or the flame-thrower of primary days. But it was the former secretary of state who pulled off the more fascinating performance -- taking command of the stage, dominating Trump on a wide array of issues, luring him into ill-advised digressions about the source of his wealth and whether he pays federal taxes. Trump complains about debate mic In an interesting strategic move, she waited until the very end of the debate to throw her sharpest dart by raising his past descriptions of women ""as pigs, slobs and dogs"" and his criticism of weight gain by 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Trump shook his head, demanding where she had gotten her information (it's on tape); but then didn't seem to have an effective response. Instead he wandered off into a digression about Rosie O'Donnell, the meanness of Clinton's ads, and the notion that he had planned to mention Bill Clinton's infidelities -- but was holding back the instinct to say ""something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family."" ""I said to myself, 'I can't do it. I just can't do it,' Trump said. And then the debate was over. One critical task for Clinton in the coming weeks is activating and energizing female voters, particularly moderate Republican and undecided women turned off by Trump. Her team clearly felt her light touch gender strategy -- provoking Trump but not complaining about her treatment -- worked Monday night. Her campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters before leaving New York that Trump's ""constant interruption of her probably was reminiscent of the way a lot of women feel about bullies in their lives. He added, ""I thought it was kind of unbecoming and he couldn't stop himself."" The campaign followed up with a gut-punching web video showing Trump's comments on Machado's weight and the nickname she said he adopted for the Latina contest winner: ""Miss Housekeeping."" Who is Alicia Machado? In a gaggle with reporters en route to North Carolina, Clinton brushed off Trump's interruptions, taking a page from Carly Fiorina's playbook when Trump made comments during the GOP primary about her face. ""I think his demeanor, his temperament, his behavior on the stage could be seen by everybody,"" Clinton told reporters who had asked about his frequent interruptions. The strategy? Let women judge for themselves. Was she fearful of future mentions of Bill Clinton's infidelity? ""He can run his campaign however he chooses, and, you know, I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American people,"" she replied. As the race has tightened in recent weeks, Trump's aides believe it is in part because they are making gains among suburban women, particularly in states like Colorado and Pennsylvania, who like Trump's childcare plan and his recent policy speeches. How Trump's performance affects that calculus remains to be seen. But he seemed to have walked into Clinton's trap on Fox & Friends Tuesday morning when he defended his comments about Machado's weight. ""I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst,"" Trump said, later adding, ""She was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem."" Clearly Trump isn't afraid to double down on his past comments about women, even when his advisers have tried to steer him toward more substantive policy issues. And Clinton is going to let that play out. CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.",1,0,0
985,"Sen. Ben Sasse is seeking answers from President Barack Obama about a pair of wire transfer payments from the U.S. to Iran that seemingly undercut the explanation he gave for a cash payment to the Islamic republic last January. Sasse’s letter comes on the heels of a POLITICO report in which the Treasury Department confirmed that the U.S. made two separate wire transfer payments, one in July 2015 and another in April 2016, to Iran. The 2015 wire transfer in particular contradicts the president’s explanation of a $400 million payment to Iran last January, which Obama said had to be delivered in cash “precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.” Story Continued Below The Treasury Department spokesman declined to offer an explanation as to why the July 2015 wire transfer was possible under U.S. sanctions against Iran while the January 2016 payment was impossible. “These wire transfers, Mr. President, seemingly contradict what you have previously told the American people,” Sasse (R-Neb.) wrote in his letter to the president. In his letter to the president, Sasse asks Obama how many wire transfer payments to Iran the U.S. government has made any how many payments it has made in cash. He also asks, among other questions, to which sanctions was Obama referring when he said at his Aug. 4 press conference that a wire transfer payment to Iran would have been impossible.",1,0,0
1326,"After a long night on Long Island on Monday, Donald Trump showed no signs of wavering at an evening rally inside an airport hangar in Melbourne, Florida in front of a friendly crowd. A day removed from the debate stage, Trump stuck close to his stump speech, repeating familiar refrains about himself, about Hillary Clinton, about his vision for his presidency and about the country he sees in front of him. The lone wrinkle to his stump speech was a new wave of claims about how he’d won the debate. Pointing to his wins in numerous, un-scientific online reader polls on websites like the Drudge Report, Trump was no more deterred by a broad sentiment among political observers that he’d lost than he was by an army of fact-checkers who’ve found many of his favorite claims are false. Story Continued Below Indeed, back in the familiar confines of a rally, Trump appeared more comfortable than the night before, leveling strong attacks against Clinton that, after repeating throughout the election, he often stayed away from Monday. Trump also cast the debate as a contrast between change and the status quo. “For 90 minutes on issue after issue Hillary Clinton defended the terrible status quo while I laid out our plan, all of us together, to bring jobs prosperity and security back to the American people,” he said. “For 90 minutes she argued against change while I called for dramatic change.” He also revealed how he dealt with his nerves in front of a television audience of 80 million people. “I knew I was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television. And I took a deep breath and I pretended I was talking to my family,” Trump said. “It was very interesting. You just block it out.” “Does everybody believe me? I was against going into Iraq,” said Trump, after the timeline of his opinions came under scrutiny once again on Monday night. (Before the invasion Trump expressed approval of it in a Howard Stern interview, and is only documented as firmly opposing it in an interview well after the American occupation of the country began.) Of the current state of the country, Trump lamented, “We have death and debt and unemployment. We have all bad things.” He called Clinton “a representative for globalists” and mocked last month’s consensus that he had only the narrowest electoral path to the presidency, remarking, “Oh wow, now they’re looking at all these paths.” Trump did steer clear of another post-debate controversy, an ongoing war of words with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who was the centerpiece of one of Clinton’s attacks on his character. Trump earlier Tuesday again criticized Machado's weight, echoing Clinton allegations that he’d earlier called her “Miss Piggy” — due to her body shape — and “Miss Housekeeping,” a racist reference to her Latino heritage. But on Tuesday evening, back in front of a large, boisterous, adoring crowd, Trump avoided the subject entirely. The rally followed a tumultuous 24 hours for Trump, starting with a panned debate performance Monday that morphed into a day of finger-pointing Tuesday, as he revived his brashest personal style to explain an erratic debate performance. The GOP nominee, beleaguered after an erratic performance in Monday’s debate — with viewership as high as 100 million — retreated to his Fox News and Twitter cocoon. There, he took potshots at debate moderator Lester Holt and cited unscientific Internet surveys to prove he’d outperformed Hillary Clinton. And his advisers hinted that he might consider skipping the next showdown between the candidates, set for Oct. 9 in St. Louis. It was a scarcely concealed defensive posture from the Trump camp, which found itself defending Trump against accusations of sexism (even as he redoubled his criticism of a former Miss Universe he had previously called “Miss Piggy,” saying on Tuesday she had gained “a massive amount of weight”). His surrogates, too, joined the pile-on against Holt, describing “hostile” questioning about his position on the Iraq War, his role in the birther controversy and his refusal to release his tax returns. Trump spent his post-debate morning in the friendly confines of Fox, calling in to “Fox & Friends” for a gentle interview, where the hosts agreed he had been asked too many tough questions. Trump couched his concerns about Holt around mild praise of his performance as moderator, but his allies correctly pointed out that Holt reserved his most probing and personal questions for the businessman and spared Clinton similarly tough questions about her handling of classified information or her untrustworthy persona. “You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther,” Trump said, “He hit me on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that.” But actually, it was Clinton who raised the 1973 housing discrimination lawsuit against Trump’s company. She also grilled him about paying no income tax over the years. Trump’s “That makes me smart” reply has Democrats salivating. (Clinton at a rally on Tuesday afternoon asked the crowd, “if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?”) Trump on Tuesday morning floated the idea that he “may hit her harder” next time around, and explained, “I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.” It was remarkable how many subjects Trump decided to skip in Monday’s debate. He made no mention of Clinton’s handling of the attack on an American compound in Benghazi. He scarcely alluded to his aggressive seal-the-borders stance on immigration, despite making it the hallmark of his campaign. Trump didn’t mention controversies about Clinton Foundation or her ties to Wall Street. (Clinton actually got in the only Wall Street-based attack, suggesting Trump was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to big banks.) Trump also skipped any mention of Clinton’s decision to label some of his supporters “deplorable.” And even as she skewered him for misleading about his position on the war in Iraq, he made only a passing mention of the fact that Clinton voted to go to war in the first place. “Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said about Holt. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.” Holt wasn’t the only target of Trump’s ire. He also peddled a conspiracy theory that his microphone had been tampered with, as he sought to explain why he may not have been at the top of his game, even as he claimed numerous online polls deemed him the night’s winner. “I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose?” Trump asked on Fox. Clinton reveled in Trump’s squirming. Buoyant from the prior night, the former secretary of state gaggled with reporters on her plane, offering a verbal shrug to the notion that Trump may not show up to the next two debates, and landing a zinger about Trump’s microphone theory. “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,” Clinton quipped as she walked away from reporters. Trump’s surrogates sought to frame the debate as a win for the Republican nominee, largely because he didn’t bring up Bill Clinton’s extramarital affairs, even though Trump alluded to them later in the evening. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, said on Tuesday morning that “as a woman” she was impressed that Trump pulled back from bringing up the affairs after Clinton attacked him for a long history of misogynistic comments. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton 'I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.' That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint,” Conway told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, parroted the talking points on CBS’s “This Morning,” also saying he was “so proud” that Trump didn’t bring up Bill Clinton’s indiscretions. “Ninety minutes in a row of one insult after another and then Donald Trump, just completely open and transparent with the American people, said, ‘There’s things I could bring up, we all know what they are, we all lived through the 1990’s,’ and he just said ‘I’m not going to do it.'” Pence said. “I think there you saw in him the restraint and temperament that would make for a good president.” While Trump’s allies argued that Trump had cleared an arguably low bar during his first primetime showdown, House Speaker Paul Ryan offered unusually effusive praise for the Republican nominee. Ryan has frequently clashed with Trump on style and substance, but he said the billionaire did what he needed to do on Monday night. For Republican lawmakers concerned about Trump’s effect on down-ballot races, the fact that Trump did not implode on stage was a relief. “I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” Ryan said at a news conference Tuesday. “I think he passed a number of thresholds... and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton.” Most pundits agreed Trump’s strongest part of the debate was the first 20 to 30 minutes, when he parried Clinton’s barbs and painted her as a typical politician – the kind he certainly is not. In a discussion of the country’s international trade deals, Trump thrashed Clinton as taking a politically motivated tack. “In all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently,” he said. “She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective … Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.” Trump said he’d tax companies who send jobs and plants to other countries and sell their products back to the United States. “What you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck,” he said. “But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.” Trump’s camp is already hinting he’s considering taking a pass on the next debate. Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani told reporters Monday night that he’d advise Trump to drop out of the next meeting because the moderators wouldn’t be fair. “If I were Donald Trump I wouldn’t participate in another debate unless I was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,” Giuliani said. “The moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.” Clinton and her allies, on the other hand, are blanketing the airwaves. Priorities USA immediately launched an ad blasting Trump’s temperament. The Clinton campaign issued its own blistering video: an interview with Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner who said Trump demeaned her when she gained weight. Campaign strategist Joel Benenson told CNN on Tuesday that Clinton was calm and collected under pressure while Trump became unhinged. “The reason why Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly won in this debate is because Donald Trump was a loose cannon throughout the debate,” Benenson said. “He was interrupting. He doesn't listen to anybody. He doesn't respect anybody. He was shouting.” In addition, Clinton, her running mate Tim Kaine and her husband, former President Bill Clinton hit the trail for her, hoping to capture some momentum from the debate. CNN's post-debate polling showed viewers largely found Clinton superior to Trump, though it’s unclear whether the debate will lead to movement in the swing-state polls, which have shown the two candidates in a dead heat.

434,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's top aide was given a limited immunity deal by the FBI in the investigation into Clinton's private email server, according to congressional sources Friday. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff and adviser at the State Department, was given the narrow immunity deal during the FBI's investigation into the former secretary of state's use of a private email server during her time in office. ""This is beyond explanation,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz said in a statement. ""The FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy. I've lost confidence in this investigation and I question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. Immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the FBI."" A spokeswoman for Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, confirmed that Mills was being given immunity. But a Democratic congressional source said the extent of the deal was limited to a search of her and another aide's laptop. According to the source, the FBI requested the laptops of Clinton's attorneys, Mills and Heather Samuelson, after they conducted a 2014 review of what emails Clinton sent were work-related and which were personal. Work-related emails were turned over to the State Department and personal emails were deleted. In exchange for giving the laptops they used to the FBI, Mills and Samuelson were given a limited immunity agreement from the Department of Justice, the Democratic source said, that they would not face prosecution for any information that was found on those laptops. ""The DOJ and FBI considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more,"" said Beth Wilkinson, an attorney for Mills. ""Indeed, the Justice Department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. At all points, my clients cooperated with the government's investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the FBI and DOJ. ""The letters released to the Hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work. Because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies' positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, I advised my clients to accept this letter from DOJ."" A Clinton campaign spokesman said Friday's leak -- coming three days before the first presidential debate -- was politically motivated. ""Three days before debate, House GOP selectively leaks details from inquiry that was closed months ago w/no charges,"" Brian Fallon tweeted. A 'criminal scheme' The FBI announced in July that it would not recommend any criminal charges in relation to its lengthy investigation of Clinton's email use. FBI Director James Comey made the announcement in an unprecedented statement to reporters, during which he also excoriated Clinton's staff for its carelessness, all while saying no criminal acts were prosecutable. First on CNN: FBI director defends Clinton email probe, document releases Since then, congressional Republicans have called Comey to testify and have demanded the FBI send its investigation materials for review. Comey is appearing again on Capitol Hill, testifying before the House Judiciary committee next Wednesday. He is expected to face more questions from Republicans about his handling of the Clinton email probe. Republican candidate Donald Trump seized on the news, with his spokesman saying it proves a ""criminal scheme."" ""No one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as President of the United States or hold any public office,"" said spokesman Jason Miller. ""In light of this development, Hillary Clinton must immediately come forward and promise the American people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration."" The Democratic source, however, said that the immunity agreement was limited and that Mills testified before Congress and spoke with the FBI without invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. ""Mills was not given immunity for any testimony or statements she gave to DOJ. She gave voluntary statements to DOJ as she had previously to the Benghazi Committee,"" the source said. The top Democrat on the Oversight panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings criticized Republicans' response to the issue. ""It's beyond disappointing—but not surprising in light of the election—that Republicans are rushing to leak inaccurate information about this very limited agreement between Ms. Mills and the Justice Department,"" Cummings said in an statement, and pointed to praise Mills received from Republicans for her participating in a nine-hour interview on the issue. An IT staffer has also been given immunity in exchange for his testimony. Mills is a former legal adviser to Clinton's campaign, was her chief of staff at the State Department and has served on the board of the Clinton Foundation. Her time at the State Department has been controversial both in terms of her handling of sensitive information via Clinton's email server and in her connection to the Clinton Foundation. While chief of staff at State, Mills traveled to New York on what her lawyer says was a volunteer basis to interview job candidates for the foundation, according to a CNN investigation.

1120,"Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton holds a huge lead over rival Donald Trump among Hispanic voters, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll out Thursday. Among likely Hispanic voters, Clinton earns 65 percent of support compared to Trump’s 17 percent, the poll finds. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson earned 9 percent while Green Party candidate Jill Stein has 2. Story Continued Below A vast majority of Hispanics surveyed – 8 in 10 – have negative views of the Republican nominee. Seven in 10 have “very negative” feelings of Trump, according to the poll, while only 15 percent have a somewhat or very positive view of him. The results come as little surprise. Early in the campaign, Trump came under fire for calling Hispanic immigrants “rapists” and criminals, for vowing to build a wall along America’s southern border and making Mexico pay for it and for kicking well-known Mexican-American journalist Jorge Ramos out of a press conference. More recently, he has pivoted on his stance on illegal immigration, saying that he’s open to softening laws on illegal immigration while also declaring there will be no amnesty for undocumented immigrants. The survey of 300 registered Hispanic voters was conducted between Sept. 15 and Sept. 20, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.66 percent.",1,0,0
964,"Even as law enforcement continues to investigate a series of bombings over the weekend in and around New York City, President Barack Obama said Monday that military successes against the Islamic State have exposed the militant group “as the failed cause that it is.” The president declined to offer specifics of the investigation into the bombings, referring reporters to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies for updates. But as the president was speaking, NBC News and other media outlets began reporting that Ahmad Rahami, a man wanted in connection with the bombings, had been taken into custody. Story Continued Below Law enforcement has not publicly tied Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent, to any terrorist group but in his public statement Monday, Obama spoke not just about the investigation into the weekend’s attacks but also the global fight to combat terrorist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. “We will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the Internet to carry out attacks. We are going to continue to go after them. We're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure,” the president said from New York, where he will attend the United Nations General Assembly meeting later this week. “As we take away more of their territory, it exposes ISIL as the failed cause that it is. And it helps to undermine their ideology which over time will make it harder to recruit and inspire people to violence.” Speaking specifically to the ongoing investigation into the bombings in New York and New Jersey, the president said he had been briefed by FBI Director James Comey and had spoken with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The president also said that a “particularly high level of federal resources” were already in place in New York to assist with the UN General Assembly and that those resources would be able to assist in the investigations. Recalling his conversations with governors Cuomo and Christie, Obama praised New Yorkers and New Jerseyans for their toughness: “Folks around here, you know, they don’t get scared. They are tough. They are resilient. They go about their business every single day.” “That kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life. That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American,” the president said. “By showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not and never will give in to fear, that's going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry out terrorist acts against us.”",1,0,0

1511,"There shouldn’t be an estate tax period. Right now the rate stands at 40%. If Hillary Clinton gets her way, she’ll raise it to a whopping 65% and I would not be surprised to see it go even higher. We are being taxed to death and Hillary loves taxes. Taxation equals slavery… it is enforced compliance and I view it as unconstitutional. But these rules don’t apply to elitists such as the Clintons who are now definitely in the top 1% of the wealthy out there. They have several tax shelters that keep this from applying to them. Isn’t that nice? I guess when they kick off, they want to make sure that Chelsea gets their wealth. But it isn’t just the estate tax with these people… they have accounting methods that shield them from almost all taxation.  From Breitbart: Hillary Clinton wants to increase the estate tax to 65 percent on the wealthiest Americans, according to her latest tax plan. The Clinton campaign estimates that the increase would raise an addition $75 billion in revenue over the next decade. The current rate maxes out at 40 percent. But Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill have created a number of tax shelters in recent years to dramatically limit their payment of the very same tax. As Bloomberg reported back in 2014: “To reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of U.S. households in wealth.” In 2010 the Clinton created “residential trusts” and the following year moved their Chappaqua estate into the trust, according to their financial records. As David Scott Sloan, a partner at the firm Holland Knight explained the Clinton trust to CBS News, “You’re creating things that are going to be on the nontaxable side of the balance sheet when they die.” The move will save the Clintons hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes, according to accountants quoted by Bloomberg. These types of taxation shelters are common among the wealthy. They do not typically apply to the rest of us. If Clinton could get away with it, she would impose a 100% tax rate. In essence, they are already doing that by using multiple layers of taxation. Creative accounting seems to only apply to the wealthy. Those who see themselves as above the rule of law. Just as Clinton skated on the email scandal and other felonies, she has found a way to shelter her wealth. She’s also adept at money laundering. She’s a multi-talented corrupt barracuda and should be in prison, not running for the presidency.  ",0,0,1
558,"While Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment was “inartful,” the former Meet the Press host David Gregory said that it “may have been accurate” based on surveys and anecdotal evidence. In an interview, CNN host Chris Cuomo and David Gregory were discussing how even though Trump is a racist – based on his comments of Muslims and illegal immigrants, and his “accepting” support from the KKK and David Duke – and a sexist – based on his comments in the past about women – the polls are showing a shocking level of support for him. Cuomo asked Gregory, “Does that tell you that people who know still don’t care?” Here’s how he responded: “Well, I think there’s an element of that. I mean, I don’t know that we can back that up by the data, but I do think just, look, anybody looks at a politician and says, ‘Look, I don’t agree with everything, but I still support them.’ I think there’s people who willfully ignore certain things that Trump says and focus on what they like about him. I think that’s true. “I think Hillary Clinton is in a posture — and you saw it in that answer which I thought was revealing — first of all, she wants to sidestep the fact that she did impugn a lot of Trump voters in a way that was inartful, but it may have been based — it may have been accurate in certain — based on some of the surveys that we’ve seen about attitudes of Trump supporters and other anecdotal information that we have. But, you know, her whole slogan rhetorically is we’re ‘stronger together,’ and that was not an example of that when she was in that fundraiser. “There she’s saying, ‘No, I’m going to speak out against hateful speech, about the fact that he’s a birther, that David Duke is behind him.’ I mean, I think this is her getting a little bit more aggressive. I think this is a preview of the kind of Hillary Clinton that we’ll see during aspects of these presidential debates.” I don’t doubt that some of Trump’s supporters choose not to focus on certain things that he says, but I don’t they’re “willfully ignoring” those things. Besides, even if they were “willfully ignoring” the controversial stuff that Trump has said, what about Hillary Clinton’s supporters? Are they really any different? They willfully ignore all the scandalous and criminal behavior that’s inextricably tied to their presidential choice. I agree that Trump has come across as brash, especially in the earlier part of his campaign, but actions speak louder than words. Has Trump committed the same level of crimes and been involved in the same level of corruption as the Clinton family?

Special report: US election By Janosch Delcker 9/23/16, 5:30 AM CET Updated 9/28/16, 7:30 AM CET Illustration by Tim McDonagh for POLITICO KALLSTADT, Germany — Few places in Germany are as representative of the country’s heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s grandfather was born — and from which he was later deported. The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes. Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular. In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy. Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” Steiniger tells POLITICO. Trump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. “He stands for everything that’s bad,” says Sarah Bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. Bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry. This year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: Saumagen-Döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. “Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says Bühler. “Pink, purple, doesn’t matter.” Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “They don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about Trump,” says Huber. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.” *   *   * Donald’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner’s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “Trump,” “Dromb” and “Trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “Drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on “Trump.” Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left. Friedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885. He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. “Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern. According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the U.S. But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902. But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. “My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,” Donald Trump’s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012. Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair’s family history. Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was “to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.” Also On Politico Matthew Karnitschnig Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald’s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born. “[The authorities] said, ‘You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says Walter. “So they left and they went back to America, and that’s why Donald and I are here.” Friedrich — now named Frederick — died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life. *   *   * In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “Kings of Kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup. For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump’s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history. On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower’s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops. Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “His assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says. “Hello, John,” Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her. Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York’s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ‘What on earth did I do?’” she says. “The cake looks really good,” Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour. Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. “They grow them well in Kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “They grow them very well. Believe me. It’s good stock.” “Wow, it’s beautiful,” Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “That’s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It’s great.” When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump’s son, Eric Trump. “Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?” Wendel asked him. “Kallstadt?” Trump Junior replied, “No, what is it?”    © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

266,"(CNN)Lawmakers hoping for a quick resolution in the talks to fund the government and provide a federal response to Zika were disappointed Monday when negotiators, who had worked through the weekend, said they would need more time to agree to a deal. ""Everything's a little up in the (air),"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership told reporters crowded outside his office waiting for word of an agreement. ""Hope springs eternal."" With no deal at hand, Senate leaders delayed until at least Tuesday a procedural vote to begin debate on the bill in hopes it might be ready then. In one sign of possible progress late Monday, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is a member of the Democratic leadership, told reporters that negotiators had resolved a key sticking point over language in the Zika measure that would prevent funds from going to a Planned Parenthood partner in Puerto Rico, something Democrats strongly oppose. ""Yes, it's resolved,"" Schumer told reporters. ""The whole Zika issue has been resolved."" But a top Senate GOP leadership aide declined to confirm Schumer's pronouncement. And about an hour before Schumer spoke, Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a senior Republican in the talks, said it would be ""very, very premature"" for Democrats to say the Zika language had been resolved. ""None of this done until it's all done,"" Blunt said. Some senators and aides of both parties predicted a hand-shake agreement on the overall deal could be reached as early as Tuesday but others doubted the partisan divide could be bridged so quickly, especially since the deadline for the government to run out of money is not until the end of the month. With control of the Senate up for grabs in November, GOP leaders are anxious to wrap up the high-priority legislation and get their vulnerable members up for re-election home to campaign. Democrats denied Republican charges they were slow-walking a final agreement but privately acknowledged that they felt no pressure to accept a quick deal they didn't like just to let Republicans go home to campaign. Among the issues being negotiated, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is pushing to add language to the government funding bill that would prevent the US from turning over to an international organization control over Internet domain names. Some Democrats are pressing for changes to the Export-Import Bank board to get around GOP opposition to confirming open slots on the board, which is disrupting some operations of the bank. Other issues include funding for Flint, Michigan's water supply problem, disaster aid for states hit my major flooding, disclosure requirements for political giving by corporations, and the number of hours truckers are allowed to drive in a week to limit driver fatigue. Some GOP lawmakers have been pushing for aid to help with damage caused by the recent Louisiana flooding. But Schumer suggested that both Flint and Louisiana would need to be addressed in a separate disaster aid package, saying the GOP was blocking additional money for Flint in the government funding package. ""They want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,"" Schumer said. ""They don't want to do Flint."" Negotiators are also working to get offsets for the cost of the $1.1 billion Zika funding. Democrats initially pressed for it all to be considered emergency funding but there were signs they were prepared to meet GOP demands for some offsets. ",1,0,0
760,"NEW YORK (AP) — An Afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked a New York City neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town was taken into custody Monday after a shootout with police in New Jersey, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. WABC-TV footage showed a man believed to be 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher in Linden, New Jersey. He appeared to be conscious and looking around.  The law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity, said two officers were shot in the gun battle. The arrest came just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Authorities said the blasts were looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. Police did not disclose how they zeroed in on Rahami but were known to be poring over surveillance video. At the same time, five people who were pulled over in a vehicle Sunday night were being questioned by the FBI, officials said. The shootout came after a weekend of fear and dread in New York and New Jersey. Video shows bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami in custody in Linden, New Jersey. pic.twitter.com/NrVJCPNAkC — Eyewitness News (@ABC7NY) September 19, 2016  In addition to the blast that injured 29 people in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found blocks away, and a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity race. No one was injured there. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Also on Saturday, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Authorities have not drawn any connection between the violence in Minnesota and the bombings in the New York area. Citing the FBI, New Jersey State Police said Monday that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information, they learned there were “certain commonalities among the bombs,” leading authorities to believe “that there was a common group behind the bombs.” Before Rahami’s capture, Cuomo said investigators have no reason to believe there are further threats, but the public should “be on constant guard.” Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that is tied to Rahami. The Rahami family lives in the apartment. The restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, is owned by Rahami’s father and has also employed some of his brothers, Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said. He said Rahami’s father and two brothers sued the city after it passed an ordinance requiring the restaurant to close early because of complaints from neighbors about it being a late-night nuisance. Ryan McCann, of Elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing Rahami working there more. “He’s always in there. He’s a very friendly guy, that’s what’s so scary. It’s hard when it’s home,” McCann said. In the immediate aftermath of the New York bombing, de New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appeared to be changing. “The more we learn with each passing hour is it looks more like terrorism,” de Blasio said in an interview on NY1 News. Cuomo said on MSNBC: “Today’s information suggests it may be foreign-related, but we’ll see where it goes.” On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped “a vehicle of interest” in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser. She wouldn’t provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the investigation. On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. Cellphones were discovered at the site of both the New York and New Jersey bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to comment on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The pipe bomb that exploded Saturday in Seaside Park went off before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled. One of the five devices found at the Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. No one was hurt. ",0,0,1
631,"Hillary and the compliant media are doing everything they can to derail Trump’s surge in the polls and keep Hillary propped up (literally). There seems to be some movement among blacks toward Trump. A five or ten percent shift in the black vote toward Trump would be significant. When things begin to go south for Democrats, they play the race card. Claiming that President Obama might not have been born in the United States is a “race card” issue. Trump raised it in 2011. This forced Hawaiian authorities to release a copy of Obama’s birth certificate, although it was not a copy of the original. It’s obvious from the historical record that Trump did not originate the birther issue. It was floating around before he took up the quest for the truth. From what we know, and the media are not reporting, the birther subject was spawned in the bowels of the Clinton campaign. Did Hillary personally promote it? Probably not. It was done by surrogates so she could claim plausible deniability. “Who me?” She had and has her “buffers” like all crime families do. The following scene is from the Godfather II Senate hearing:  Here is some of what we know: “[Ben Smith and Byron Tau] detailed in a lengthy four-page-long investigation how in April 2008, when Clinton was slipping in her battle against Obama for the Democratic nomination for the presidency, ‘Clinton supporters’—as they say—circulated an anonymous email chain that pushed the theory. “‘Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth,’ the email that Clinton supporters circulated read.” “Those anonymous people were hardly the only ones. In fact, as Joshua Green reported in The Atlantic in August 2008, a March 19, 2007 strategy memo from longtime Clinton adviser Mark Penn proves that the Clinton campaign itself was pushing the conspiracy theory. Penn, in the memo, advocated that Clinton target Obama’s ‘lack of American roots.’” (Breitbart) Read more: “Hillary Clinton and the True History of Obama ‘Birtherism.’” I suggest that you read the entire Breitbart article to see how Hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign was knee-deep in the suggestion that Obama was not born in the United States and his “lack of American roots.”[1] But the birther issue goes back further – to 1991. Joseph Farah of WND asks, “Who Was the First ‘Birther’?” “Trump was hardly the first ‘birther.’ Neither was I. Nor was my colleague Jerome Corsi. And neither was Hillary Clinton. “That honor belongs to one person and one person alone – Barack Obama.” How is this possible? “Obama went to extreme lengths to conceal his past. And, indeed, if he was born in the U.S. and was eligible to serve as president, he certainly did his best to create the mystery that led to the question being asked. “Years earlier, he billed himself as having been born in Kenya. “Maybe he thought it was a sexy way to sell books, get a foreign student scholarship, attract women – who knows? “But it’s a fact that he boasted about it.” (WND) The evidence? It comes from a short bio that was “used by Barack Obama’s literary agency beginning in 1991 and ending in 2007 – the year he declared his candidacy for president.” Here’s the first sentence of the opening paragraph (Breitbart): “Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.”  Even Snopes says it’s true. The editor of the short biography states that it “was a simple mistake and nothing more” to say that Obama was born in Kenya.  I’ll take him at his word. I can’t take him at his word given what the two images below show. It remains a fact that there was a biography from a “client list Acton & Dystel published in 1991” that states that Obama was born in Kenya that remained unquestioned until 2007. Obama himself had 16 years to disavow the information and call for a correction. It would have been unusual for a literary agency not to send a copy of the bio to Obama for his approval. Are we to believe that in 16 years in never saw the bio? In addition, there is ample evidence that people inside the Clinton campaign gave credence to the Kenyan birther issue for political reasons in order to sabotage Obama’s campaign. The media will continue to claim that Hillary Clinton had nothing to do with the birther issue because a lie is better than a Trump presidency. UPDATE: The following images were posted on my Facebook page. In this first image, in June 1998, Jane Dystel Literary Management company was still reporting that Obama was born in Kenya  As recent as 2007, Dystel & Goderich Literary Management continued the narrative that Obama was born in Kenya:                     _____________________________ [1] “NOTE FROM SENIOR MANAGEMENT [at Breitbart]: Andrew Breitbart was never a ‘Birther,’ and Breitbart News is a site that has never advocated the narrative of ‘Birtherism.’ In fact, Andrew believed, as we do, that President Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961.” Reposted With Permission From Constitution.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",0,0,1
1037,"After Fox News host Sean Hannity appeared in a pro-Donald Trump political video over the weekend, the network will prohibit him from appearing in promotional political materials through the end of the election, a spokesperson said Tuesday. “We were not aware of Sean Hannity participating in a promotional video and he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election season,” the spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO. On Sunday, Trump’s presidential campaign uploaded an eight-minute video that showed a number of conservative figures expressing their support of the Republican candidate. One of those figures included the Fox News show host, who spoke for about 30 seconds expressing his support of the candidate. The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple was the first to report on the video. Hannity has been a long-time supporter of Trump, and said in June that he would be voting for the Republican nominee. But his appearance in the campaign video released Sunday was the first of its kind this election season. It’s unclear how the network will address Hannity’s appearance in the video during a town hall with Trump on the network Wednesday, which Hannity is scheduled to host.

1101,"The top official in the country’s largest police union tweaked Donald Trump on Wednesday for leaping to blame the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Trump last week, and that endorsement still stands, said Jim Pasco, the group’s executive director. But of Trump, said Pasco, ""he must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.” Story Continued Below Trump has been reaching out to black voters in recent weeks, and on Wednesday, the Republican presidential nominee said he was “very, very troubled” by Tuesday’s shooting of Terence Crutcher by Officer Betty Shelby, and suggested her inexperience was to blame. ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? They can't be doing what they're doing,” Trump said at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. ""I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up,” Trump continued. “That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man."" The Fraternal Order of Police boasts 330,000 members, most of whom are rank-and-file cops, from all over the country. Last week, its national board voted to endorse Trump, based on members’ votes at the state chapter level. Trump’s law-and-order message and unequivocal support for police in other recent confrontations between cops and black men have made him popular with law enforcement, so his criticism of Shelby was an unusual departure. Clinton has sharply criticized the killings of both Crutcher and Keith Lamont Scott, whose death in Charlotte, N.C., prompted protests even as police said he was armed. Clinton said that such killings should “become intolerable” and touted the need for reform on Wednesday, and the day before she spoke about “implicit bias” in the context of the Tulsa incident. That prompted Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway to attack Clinton Wednesday morning, saying on Fox News, “It’s just unbelievable that she would do that before we even know the facts, the details. I think that’s an overpoliticization of a situation where we don’t know the facts.” Conway’s remarks came before Trump’s own suggestion that the officer choked.",1,0,0
1538,"You’d think that putting together a list of the 7 worst mass murderers in American history would be a straightforward task. Unfortunately, it’s not, because there are quite a few “mass murders” that most Americans don’t consider to fit the definition. For example, most people wouldn’t look at  the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Tulsa Race Riot, or 80 Branch Davidians dying when Bill Clinton’s Department of Justice moved in on them to be “mass murders.” So, as a definition, we’re talking about large killings on American soil, perpetrated by a single person or small group of people. What follows are the 7 worst mass murderers in American history.     Location: Newtown, Connecticut Nickname: Sandy Hook Massacre Year: 2012 Method: Semi-automatic rifle, semi-automatic pistol Deaths: 27 Adam Lanza had Asperger's syndrome and was anorexic and mentally ill; he became increasingly isolated and dysfunctional. On Lanza’s 20th birthday, he shot his mother four times in the head with one of her guns while she slept. Then he drove her car to the Sandy Hook Elementary School where he killed 20 children between the ages of 5 and 10, along with 6 adults. After he finished his murderous rampage, Lanza shot himself in the head and died on the scene.     Location: Blacksburg, Virginia  Nickname: Virginia Tech Massacre Year: 2007 Method: Two semi-automatic pistols Deaths: 32 Cho was born in South Korea, but was a legal resident of the United States. He had depression and anxiety problems and seemed to have extreme difficulty talking with people. Like Adam Lanza, some of his teachers were alarmed at the violent stories he wrote. In fact one of them, Lucinda Roy, said she was concerned for her safety when she met with him one on one and said she reported him to school authorities. Unfortunately, nothing was done. Cho spent months planning the attack, but it began in a bizarre fashion. Cho murdered Emily Jane Hilscher in her dorm room along with Ryan Clark who apparently tried to help her. There has been some speculation that Cho had a crush on her, but there doesn’t seem to be definitive proof of that. After killing both of them, Cho managed to escape back to his dorm room without being detected. There he mailed an angry, rambling manifesto to NBC. Two and a half hours after the first killings, Cho went to another building on campus and killed an additional 25 students and 5 teachers. Afterwards, Cho committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.     Location: New York, New York Nickname: Wall Street Bombing Year: 1920 Method: Dynamite (bomb) Deaths: 38 In 1920, a horse drawn carriage filled with 100 pounds of dynamite and 500 pounds of iron was parked outside the J.P. Morgan Bank in New York City. The bomb killed 38 people and wounded another 143. There was speculation that communists or anarchists were behind the bombing, but unfortunately, the perpetrator was never caught.     Location: Rancho Santa Fe, California Nickname: Heaven’s Gate Suicide Year: 1997 Method: Persuasion/suffocation Deaths: 38 Marshall Applewhite was the gay leader of the Heaven’s Gate Cult. Applewhite, who had such a hold over his followers that he convinced six of them to join him in being CASTRATED, told the cult members that they had to kill themselves in order to hitch a ride on a UFO hiding behind the Hale-Bopp comet. Over a THREE DAY LONG PERIOD, the cult members, including Marshall Applewhite, took phenobarbital and vodka, then put plastic bags over their heads and suffocated to death.     Location: Bath Township, Michigan Nickname: Bath School Disaster Year: 1927 Method: Dynamite/Pyrotol (bomb) Deaths: 44 Kehoe was the elected treasurer of the Bath Consolidated School Board and was temporarily appointed as the Bath Township Clerk. After losing an election for the position, Kehoe, who was also deep in debt, stopped maintaining his farm. Soon thereafter, his farm went into foreclosure. Adding to the pressure on Kehoe, his wife was ill with tuberculosis. Yet and still, Kehoe didn’t simply “snap.” He used his position as the school’s volunteer handyman to his advantage. It allowed him to spend MONTHS planting explosives near the Bath school. Kehoe started by murdering his own wife and then set his farm on fire. From there, Kehoe went to the school and set off the explosives he’d planted. Thirty seven children, most of whom were between the ages of 6 and 8, died in the explosions. However, Kehoe wasn’t done yet. After rescue efforts began, Kehoe drove up to a group including the school superintendent and detonated his truck, which was filled with dynamite. Kehoe and 6 victims died in the blast. When his farm was searched afterward, a sign with the words “Criminals Are Made, Not Born” was found.     Location: Orlando, Florida Nickname: Orlando nightclub shooting Year: 2016 Method: Semi-automatic rifle, Semi-automatic pistol Deaths: 49 Omar Mateen was a radical Muslim whose father supported the Taliban. Mateen’s wife knew the attacks were coming and even helped him scope out the Pulse Nightclub. Former classmates remembered Mateen cheering the 9/11 attacks. There was rampant speculation that Mateen was actually gay and taking revenge for being rejected by men in the club, but FBI sources have commented that they’ve found no evidence that Mateen was “secretly gay.” At 2:00 a.m., Mateen walked into the gay Pulse Nightclub in Orlando and started shooting. By the time he was done, 49 people were dead. During his rampage, Mateen called 911 and News 13 of Orlando in order to let people know he was pledging allegiance to ISIS. After the police arrived, Mateen took hostages. Eventually, SWAT stormed the building and Mateen was shot 8 times and killed.     Location: Oklahoma City Nickname: Oklahoma City Bombing Year: 1995 Method: Ammonium Nitrate (bomb) Deaths: 168 On April 19, 1995, which was the 2nd anniversary of the end of the Branch Davidian siege, a truck bomb was parked under the day care center in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. It contained more than 4000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and the explosion was enormous with 324 nearby buildings damaged or destroyed while 168 people died and 680 were injured. Within an hour and a half of the bombing, Timothy McVeigh, the man who had driven the truck, was picked up on a traffic stop and quickly linked to the bombing. After searching the house of McVeigh’s father, evidence led the FBI to his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. Nichols turned himself in. At the trial, it was revealed that Lori Fortier knew about the bombing, but did nothing to warn anyone. Her husband Michael actually helped scout the location. Timothy McVeigh was a militia member who was angry about government abuses in Waco and at Ruby Ridge and took his revenge with the bombing. In May of 2001, McVeigh was put to death by lethal injection. Nichols is still serving 161 life sentences. Michael Fortier, who testified against McVeigh and Nichols in return for leniency for his wife and a reduced sentence, served 10 1/2 years while his wife was given immunity.  ",0,0,1

I don’t deal in micro-aggressions where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they’re looking for.” He further defended his controversial remarks by saying, “If a metaphor offends someone, I can understand that and maybe that’s the world we live in today, but I’m not comparing someone to candy, I’m using it as a – it’s a statistical thing. We have to be careful who let into this country. You’ve seen what’s going on in Europe – and this is not just about terrorists, it’s about the rape statistics that have gone on there.” On Monday, Trump, Jr. tweeted a photo of a bowl of skittles captioned, “If I had a bowl of skittles and told you three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That’s our Syrian refugee problem.” A large social media backlash ensued, and he was heavily criticized for likening refugees to the fruit candy. Skittles parent company Wrigley also denounced the tweet.",1,0,0
433,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday. The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%. Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included. Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump. Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament. With the candidates' health on the minds of voters following Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, respondents were asked who has more stamina to be president -- 53% said that Trump does, while just 39% said the same of Clinton. Voters gave Clinton the edge over Trump on a series of key issues. On terrorism (52% to 41%), immigration (54% to 41%), creating good jobs (49% to 43%) and trade (52% to 42%), Clinton is viewed as the better candidate. The McClatchy-Marist poll was conducted through September 15 to 20, and surveyed 758 likely voters. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.6 points. ",1,0,0
771,"Back in August, after showing up an hour late to her first campaign event in Nevada, Hillary was used by Ed Hendy “The FBI believes you tried to wipe the entire server. Did you try to wipe the entire…so there could be no email–no personal, no official; wipe the whole thing?” Hillary acted puzzled in her reply, interpreting the question literally; “Like with a cloth or something?” I say she was acting because she had previously wiped her server with BleachBit, a tool so good for deleting emails permanently that “even God can’t read them,” as Trey Gowdy put it in a committee meeting. He cited it as “further proof that Clinton had something to hide in deleting personal emails from the private email system she used during her tenure as Secretary of State.” I’m inclined to think the same, given Hillary’s lengthy history of dishonesty. Now, we’ve just uncovered PROOF that Hillary has researched how to delete emails permanently without leaving a trace. Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who helped Hillary Clinton wipe her server clean of evidence requested from federal authorities, took to online forums to find advice on how to commit the crime. Combetta cited his Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to answer questions before a congressional committee last week, but was pretty talkative when trying to find out information from fellow IT experts on how to forge Clinton’s e-mails.

956,"The Islamic State and its supporters shocked North America and Europe over the past year with a series of attacks, sowing public fear and becoming the top security issue in the U.S. presidential election. Journalist Rukmini Callimachi has become an indispensable guide to understanding the group—and cutting through the fog of misinformation from politicians. We asked Graeme Wood, a journalist known for his own groundbreaking Atlantic cover story tracing the Islamic State’s intellectual roots, to talk with Callimachi about what it’s like to try to penetrate one of the world’s most dangerous and shadowy organizations—and what we’re still getting wrong. Graeme Wood: We’re still shocked and surprised by what ISIS does, even though this has been going on for years. The continued shock is partly due to their violence, but I wonder if it might be partly our fault, as journalists, for failing to help the public understand ISIS. What are we doing wrong? Rukmini Callimachi: The systemic failure in the media in covering ISIS is that the majority of reporters are doing it in a semaphore fashion. Their main entree to the group is what U.S. officials and analysts say, and they’re not contacting members of the terror group or really studying its propaganda. I can’t think of any other beat where we do that. If we cover a court case involving a murderer, we would still seek out the side of that murderer, even as we realize that what people say is going to be self-serving. Wood: You’ve now interacted with many ISIS people—including in person. What do they have in common? Callimachi: First, I would say, is ideology. I have never spoken to any member of these groups, not just ISIS, but also Al Qaeda, Shabab, etc., who wasn’t driven by the ideology. Beyond that, a lot of people are wounded in some way—they’ve fallen out of society in some manner. So the Sunday school teacher in Washington state, who in three months converted online and was planning for travel to the Islamic State, had been born with fetal alcohol syndrome, couldn’t hold down a job, had very few friends. You see an emptiness at the core of this person. All of the ones I’ve spoken to seem to have veered off course from lives we consider acceptable and successful. Of course, there are others like Osama bin Laden, who was a wealthy and successful businessperson. Wood: Why do they talk to you? Callimachi: It’s become extremely difficult to speak to active ISIS members now. I was speaking to them in 2015, and the last one was killed in a drone strike. So now, if I’m speaking to them, it’s after they’ve defected. Of course there is self-selection there, because these are people who became disaffected. Wood: Do you think it helps that you’re a woman? Callimachi: It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve had countless jihadis shut me down straightaway and say, “I’m not allowed to speak to any woman who is not my relative.” But among the few I’m able to get through to, I think that being female makes me more approachable, soft, all the stereotypes of what female means. Wood: What are the biggest remaining mysteries? What are the things we need to know that would really help us understand the group? Callimachi: I’m really curious as to the actual structure of the Emni [the intelligence unit that handles foreign attacks]. And Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the head of it. There are so few pictures of him. We don’t even really know what he looks like. For somebody with this outsized influence projecting murder abroad, you’d think that we would know a lot more by now. And then the role of the hostages. One of ISIS’ biggest propaganda coups was the beheadings of the aid workers and journalists. Is [Emni], the group that is exporting fighters overseas, also the one that was holding James Foley and John Cantlie and Kayla Mueller? Wood: In one frightening quote, a jailed ISIS supporter tells you he thinks the number of ISIS operatives who have been sent to Europe is in the hundreds. Why haven’t we seen more attacks? Callimachi: You have to keep in mind that there’s a number of logistical hurdles that they have to jump through in Europe in order to get explosives or guns. So for example, the Villejuif shooter in April 2015 who planned to attack a church: According to French press reports, he was instructed by ISIS to go to a sandwich shop, and the weapons would be waiting for him in a car parked outside. He was just told the make of the car, told to go there, told to pick them up. Putting that kind of attack together, using encrypted communications or other means, is not easy. But during the height of Ramadan, I was covering one or two attacks a week. These are people willing to die. Wood: One change we’ve seen is a dramatic increase in body counts per attack. For a long time, they were very low, with many attacks killing no one but the attacker, but now with Paris, Orlando and Nice, the numbers are much higher. Do you think that ISIS is planning a spectacular attack, along the September 11 model—or would that be too risky for them, too likely to be detected? Callimachi: They’re implementing what was the strategy of Al Qaeda, which was to have attacks of different levels simultaneously. … So the idea is, on the one hand you have these spectacular attacks that take months to plan, and others like Reda Hame, a French national, who went to Syria and was there for about a week, given a couple of days of target practice and one day of encryption training, sent back and arrested almost immediately. And then there are the ones inspired solely through digital means, through the group reaching out through its propaganda and inciting them to attack. From what we are seeing, they are trying to do all three at the same time. It seems to me that a 9/11-style attack is impractical. They’d be putting in so many resources and so much time—but they can get the same horrific results from a guy with a truck. The death count is not the same, but the emotional impact for people in France was significant, and it took just a rental-car contract. Wood: We’ve both written about ISIS’ habit of justifying its actions with religious argument. What’s the best evidence for and against the view that a religious vision is at the core of what ISIS is doing? Callimachi: People who have left the group talk about how a religious inspiration took them to ISIS. It was their feeling of being marginalized as Muslims in the society where they were living, and then buying into the promise of a caliphate and of a Muslim land that is governed as in the time of the prophet. I have yet to meet anybody, or speak to anybody, who was not religiously motivated at some level. There are other things: the excitement of taking part in a war, a sense of belonging. Wood: When you talk to people who have removed themselves from ISIS, what do they say? Callimachi: They say that there comes a moment when the inconsistencies and apparent hypocrisies of their sheikh lets them down, and they begin rereading scripture and find ways that vouch for a nonliteralist reading of the Koran. We know that Muhammad waged war against the Qurayshi tribe, his own tribe, and it’s from that conflict that much of the concept of jihad and verses that ISIS now uses to justify beheadings come from. A young man just told me that he went back and read this carefully [and saw] the prophet and his people were fighting the Quraysh because they were not allowing the prophet and his people to practice their religion. We are now in a society, he said, where the Prophet Muhammad could practice his religion freely. So anyway, I find that interesting, you know: Scripture is also the way out.

143,"Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said sheâd rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have optedÂ to stay out of this election â until now. Word of George H.W. Bushâs decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and itâs a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead. Itâs a controversial decision, but obviously Bush recognizes that itâs the smartest choice for the future of this country. The Trump campaign, as you can imagine, isnât taking this lightly. In an interview with CNNâs Erin Burnett, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bushâs voting decision and couldnât have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it. Conway said that although she ârespectsâ Bushâs choice, itâs ironic that heâs voting forÂ âthe wife of the man who knocked him out of the raceâ in 1992. Conway alsoÂ chalked up Bushâs decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and âhurt feelingsâ over his sonâs loss to Trump in the primaries. She said: âThis was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectationsâ¦ I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.â You can watch the interview below: âJeb Bush really failedâ¦there are a lot of hurt feelingsâ @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL â OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016  This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what weâd expect it to be. The Bush familyÂ is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. This election is no joke â itâs about far more than Republican and Democrat parties. Itâs about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it â and the Bushâs are smart enough to recognize that. ",0,1,0
681,"The extremely exhausted Hillary and her extremely boring VP pick have written a book that is currently #5,301 on the Amazon books bestseller list. It’s really quite laughable that with only a little more than one month until the general election, Hillary can be found desperately hawking a book nobody wants to read at a rally in a tiny community center gymnasium in Orlando with only 300 people. That would be funny in and of itself, but Hillary’s desperation to sell a horrible book to a tiny and lethargic crowd (who are likely being paid to occupy seats) is not even the best part of the story.

637,"I think what’s most likely is that the audience just thought the candidate was being funny. I mean, isn’t it a joke to say that anyone in the Clinton family is honest? Even if it weren’t a joke, the congressional candidate on the Democratic ticket had to have known that his comment would have elicited laughter from the audience. He made his comments during a debate with incumbent representative David Jolly. Former Florida Governor Charlie Crist is vying for Rep. Jolly’s spot in the state’s 13th congressional district. The moderator had asked Crist if he was planning on voting for his party’s nominee. Here’s how he answered: “I am proud of Hillary Clinton. I think she’s been a very good secretary of state, a very good senator from the state of New York. The thing I like most about her is I believe she is steady. I believe that she is strong. I believe that she is honest. And I look forward to voting for her.” “Honest” and “steady,” huh? That had to have been a joke. I don’t know exactly what he meant by “steady,” but that’s an interesting way to describe Hillary, especially in the midst of her health crisis. Why would he refer to her as being steady? She would have collapsed at that 9/11 memorial event if it weren’t for her security detail breaking her fall and carrying her into the van. The crowd reacted appropriately as one does when a comedian pokes fun at a politician.  Even Democrats understand Hillary’s aversion to honesty. A staggering 64% of voters – and that’s including Democrats – believe that their candidate is not honest or trustworthy, according to a recent Fox News poll. Of course, it probably won’t stop them from voting for her just the same.    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",0,0,1
1332,"Donald Trump believes that ""global warming is naturally occurring"" and humans are not the cause, his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday morning on CNN — a stance that flies in the face of the vast majority of mainstream climate science. Conway was trying to walk back the Manhattan billionaire's previous dismissals of climate change as a ""hoax"" driven by China. But while her remarks Tuesday might seem less extreme on the surface, they still did nothing to assuage climate activists' fears that a President Trump would attempt to bring a wrecking ball to the Obama administration's efforts to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming. Story Continued Below ""He doesn't believe it's manmade,"" CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota said to Conway, referring to climate change. ""Correct,"" Conway responded. Camerota suggested: ""So he believes the idea that it's manmade is a hoax."" ""No, I didn't say that,"" Conway said. The Sierra Club tweeted afterward: ""Trump's campaign manager confirmed this morning that he doesn't understand science."" Hillary Clinton had drawn attention to Trump's beliefs on climate science during Monday night's presidential debate, saying, “Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.” Trump interrupted to reply that “I did not, I do not say that."" But in fact, Trump has repeatedly made such remarks on Twitter, writing in 2012 that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” And in 2013, he posted that “Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee — I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!” Presented with those posts Tuesday morning, Conway said Trump believes “that climate change is naturally occurring, that there are shifts naturally occurring,” but added that the GOP nominee does not believe that those shifts are manmade. The vast majority of scientists disagree, saying carbon emissions from power plants, automobiles, agriculture and other human activities are driving climate change, although natural factors have an effect as well. Conservatives often explain their opposition to cutting U.S. emissions by claiming nonetheless that global warming is an entirely natural phenomenon, even if they sometimes argue that warming has halted or is cyclical. Conway also dismissed the notion that it is possible to grasp Trump’s policy positions, be they on climate change or his stance on the U.S. invasion of Iraq, from the non-traditional media he wields so frequently. “I think that's based on a tweet,” Conway said when asked about Trump’s previous statements that climate change is a hoax. “I just love that, that this whole man, whether he's giving a, ‘Yeah, I guess so,’ answer to Howard Stern about invading Iraq as a private citizen on an entertainment radio show, or through a tweet, we're supposed to understand all of his policies.” However, Trump also described climate change as ""a hoax"" and ""a money-making industry"" at a December rally in South Carolina, during his run for president. Later, Conway suggested that it is Clinton, not Trump, who has been unclear on the issue of climate change. “We don't know what Hillary Clinton believes because nobody ever asks her,” Conway said, to which Camerota replied that the former secretary of state had addressed the issue quite clearly at Monday night’s debate. Clinton also has repeatedly promoted her climate change agenda on the campaign trail. “Oh, she gave us the canned, scripted responses, Alisyn, about ‘Somebody's going to be the clean energy super power,’” Conway said. “Look, I can't blame her. She obviously was overprepared and wanted to make sure we heard every single scripted moment, including the snarky ones that she had prepared to say.” GOP vice presidential candidate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, in a separate CNN interview, tried to recast his running mate's hoax comments as aimed at the notion ""that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., can control the climate of the Earth,"" and he blasted the Obama administration's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And Pence also broke from both Trump's stance and the earlier comments from Conway in acknowledging that human activity was changing the climate. ""Well, look, there's no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,"" he said. Tuesday's exchange on climate science occurred on the same morning that the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's climate agenda — regulations on power plants' greenhouse gas emissions — were facing crucial legal arguments in front of a federal appellate court in Washington, D.C.",1,0,0
53,"Donald Trump has praised the policing tactic known as “stop and frisk” on the campaign trail, but the controversial technique has a questionable history in New York City. The stop-question-and-frisk program entails NYPD officers’ randomly stopping people on the street, on the theory that such searches help law enforcement identify people with illegal handguns and deter crime. Supporters credit the program with helping to push down homicides and other major crimes in New York City to historic lows, but opponents have another description: racial profiling. A federal judge in New York ruled in 2013 that the program was unconstitutional and violated the rights of minorities because they were being disproportionally targeted by the practice. Between 2003 and 2015, for instance, more than half of those who were subjected to searches were black and about 30 percent of the other searches were of Latinos, according to an analysis of New York Police Department records by the New York Civil Liberties Union. The NYPD stopped the most New Yorkers in 2011 -- 685,724 – before the number dropped to 532,911 in 2012 and 191,558 in 2013, the year when the federal ruling was handed down.       The number of reported stops then dropped dramatically to 45,787 in 2014 and 22,939 last year, according to the figures analyzed by the NYCLU. ""Tactics like stop and frisk or tactics that utilize race-based profiles are ineffective because they don’t differentiate between those in the community who may be involved in criminal activity and those who are simply residents in the community,” professor John Cohen of the Rutgers University School of Criminal Justice said. ""So what tends to happen is you tend to have a greater number of confrontational police interactions with members of the community who are not involved in any type of illegal activity. That not only is ineffective operationally but it also tends to cause tension between those members of the community who are the people you want to have good relationships with,” Cohen, an ABC News consultant, former police officer and former acting Homeland Security undersecretary, added. The NYPD records analyzed by the NYCLU note that the number of people who were completely innocent account for 80 to 90 percent of the searches. ""It’s not helping you in the short run because your officers are spending time with people who aren’t involved in criminal activity,” Cohen said. Trump, who has calls himself the “law and order candidate,” has lauded the NYPD “stop and frisk” program on the campaign trail, saying in Ohio Wednesday the program “was incredible, the way that worked.” When asked by an African-American audience member at the Fox News town hall event about how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump said, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.” But his praise may not sit well with many African-American voters, whom Trump has been actively courting in recent weeks. Cohen said, ""The reason why African-Americans and other minority members will react negatively to his comments on stop and frisk is because many African-Americans and Latinos equate stop and frisk with racial profiling and, from a law enforcement perspective, racial profiling is operationally ineffective and unconstitutional.” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, took issue with Trump's suggestion today when asked about it during a news conference for the Congressional Black Caucus. ""For years 'stop, question and frisk' was implemented in New York and it had nothing to do with the decline in crime,"" Jeffries said. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" he said.",1,0,0
818,"Two girls were out with their mother enjoying a meal at a restaurant in Stockton, California. When they were done their meal, they left the restaurant and that’s when things went horribly south. The two teen girls, both about 100 lbs each, and their Mother encountered a group of terrible people. It was a group of Black Lives Matter supporters.  The group approached the three girls, beat them with punches and kicks, threw trash at them, screamed racist taunts about white people, and hurt them so badly that police had to rush the three girls to the hospital. What did these three girls have to do with anything? They were minding their own business enjoying some family time. Maybe if the losers in Black Lives Matter had a better family life at home, then they wouldn’t be so screwed up. Black moms often have 5+ kids and don’t really take care of any of them. The black dads are often nowhere to be found. What kind of life is that? And no, it’s not racist to say that. It’s a FACT, not a stereotype. Take a walk through any urban neighborhood and ask these “mothers” why they have multiple kids, no job, and half the kids have a different last name. Screwed up, right? One of the Black LIES Thug attackers proved just how stupid these people are. This idiot bragged about the attack and how he got his “hits” in. He supposedly had a video too!

388,"Pittsburgh (CNN)Donald Trump called Thursday for a ""national anti-crime agenda"" to combat violent crime in US cities as he condemned the unrest that unfolded overnight in Charlotte, North Carolina, where protests turned violent. ""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities,"" Trump said during a speech here to a conference of shale oil and natural gas producers. After police shot a man officials say was armed, two nights of protests followed there, slipping into violence Wednesday night with numerous civilian and police injuries reported, as well as looting and property destruction. Trump, who has focused on restoring ""law and order"" in his presidential campaign, seized on the unrest in Charlotte to renew his call for tough-on-crime policies to bring down crime rates in major American cities and once again appeal to African-Americans to join his campaign. ""The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where crime is so rampant,"" Trump said. ""There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration, ever, ever."" RELATED: Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violence Trump also tied the eruption of violent protests on Wednesday night to drugs, saying in Pittsburgh that ""drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night"" -- though he offered no evidence to back up that claim.

Praised stop-and-frisk Trump praised the policing practiced under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, which included the use of ""stop-and-frisk"" and a greater crackdown on misdemeanor offenses and has been credited with helping bring down the city's crime rate during the 1990s. ""Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache possible,"" Trump said of Giuliani, who is now a top adviser and surrogate. Speaking to Fox News a day earlier, Trump spoke out in favor of the controversial stop-and-frisk policy Giuliani put in place in New York which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 for being a ""policy of indirect racial profiling."" Trump said Thursday morning that he was calling for that policy to be implemented in Chicago, where gun violence has skyrocketed, with more than 3,000 people shot in that city so far this year. RELATED: New York mayor: Donald Trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk' During that interview, Trump also highlighted what he saw as a ""lack of spirit"" between communities. ""It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing,"" he said. Trump offered few details in his Pittsburgh speech of what would be included in his ""national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again,"" beyond saying that he will ""make reduction of crime a top priority"" and appoint ""the best"" prosecutors and federal investigators to go after criminal gangs and cartels. Trump has previously said that he would look to increase the number of police officers in inner cities to bring down the crime rate and improve training, but has offered little other specifics on this policy front. ""Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success,"" he said. Asked Wednesday about the police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa, Oklahoma, that have reignited the debate over race and policing in the country, Trump did not address the Charlotte incident but said he was ""very, very troubled"" by the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, in Tulsa on Friday night. Trump suggested the police officer who fatally shot Crutcher ""got scared"" or ""was choking,"" referring to individuals who fail under pressure.

Now, a handwritten letter has been made public that details the torture that Cathriona White faced after she contracted the diseases. Say: ‘I gave you this, intentional or not, I gave it to you. I understand that this is something that will affect you for the rest of your life and future relationships. What can make this right?’ Instead of that, I was disrespected, degraded, called a whore, an opportunist, threatened, our relationship belittled. …and I don’t really think you can see. Like it’s not an issue to you. I’m just an ungrateful bitch who you’ve done so much for and I took advantage. That simply is not true. Picking myself back up emotionally and mentally is one thing, people have bad experience and break-ups, it’s hard but with time they move on, meet someone new, start over. Add in disease. How does someone move on and meet someone new? …I am damaged. I am disgusting. When I shower I feel sick. Getting turned on…what’s that? Certainly not something that happens (to) me any more. I will always be damaged goods and have a stigma attached. So I have to accept something I was always afraid of. Being alone. Being abandoned and alone.” The closing of her letter is perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the whole thing, and honestly, it made me cry. “Be good to yourself. I will always have love in my heart for you. I pray that you are content and have peace in your life and in your soul.” It takes a big person to wish well the very person who is the reason she is so miserable that she took her own life. Whose side are you on, team Carrey or team White? ",0,0,1
73,"While the biggest attraction during the presidential debate tonight will be the two candidates on stage, at least some attention will likely be paid to those in the audience. Here's a look at who the candidates invited to sit in the audience at tonight's debate.  Hillary Clinton's campaign this morning released a partial list of guests invited by the Democratic presidential nominee to the debate at Hofstra University in New York. The four women on the list are all supporters who have developed a special relationship with Clinton over the years. They include a 9/11 survivor; a single mom and domestic abuse survivor; and a woman who became a pen pal to Clinton when she was the first lady. The list also includes Anastasia Somoza -- a woman with cerebral palsy who was recently featured in a campaign attack ad about Donald Trump's mocking of a disabled reporter.       Most notably, the Clinton campaign has also given Dallas Mavericks owner and Trump antagonist Mark Cuban a front-row ticket for the show. Chelsea Clinton is also expected to attend, according to a spokeswoman for the former first daughter. And, the Clinton camp said this morning it is hosting 1,200 debate-watch parties across all 50 states tonight. Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine will attend a watch party in Orlando, Florida, organized by the Human Rights Campaign. Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, will also attend that event, an aide said.  This morning, reports emerged that the Republican nominee invited Mark Geist, one of the survivors of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to attend the debate. Geist has been vocal in his support of Trump's candidacy; he spoke on the first night of the Republican National Convention alongside fellow security contractor John Tiegen about the attack in Benghazi. Trump also over the weekend fired off a tweet about a possible guest to the debate. After Mark Cuban posted about his plans to attend the event in support of Clinton, Trump tweeted Saturday: “If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!”  If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!  Bill Clinton admitted in the 1990s to having had a sexual relationship with Flowers two decades earlier. On Sunday morning, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told ABC's ""This Week"" that Flowers, ""has not been invited by the campaign."" However, the Clinton camp used Trump's tweet to accuse the Republican nominee of acting unpresidential. ""He's a reality TV star. He’s very experienced at providing television entertainment. The presidency is not about entertainment. It’s about serious decisions,"" Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos Sunday.

858,"Legendary Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein went on CNN with Brian Stelter in the aptly named “Reliable Sources” program, when the host asked one of the least important questions on the campaign trail today – yet another inquiry into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s health. Bernstein’s response was perfect: There is a much larger question about the overall coverage of this campaign by the electronic media, by cable and network news. We’ve been terrific at interpretation at giving equal time to debate panels, but we’ve been positively awful in terms of reporting in a coherent way the biggest story of this campaign: the real existing life and records of Donald Trump. The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal have done fabulous reporting on this and we give snippets of it.We need to be doing an hour, two hours a night of real biography, running it over and over of what Trump’s life and record have been about because they’re at absolute odds with the mythical and lying story that he has told us. He’s a con man. It’s been established. And also he has presided over a cover up of his own life. And we have allowed it in cable news and network news particularly. Few journalists in America today are more respected than Carl Bernstein and his colleague Bob Woodward, whose doggedly persistent journalism uncovered the last time Republicans broke into the Democratic National Committee for political reasons, and ultimately forced President Richard Nixon to resign from office in 1974 amidst the Watergate affair. Unlike the 1970s, this time we found out the results of the Russian invasion into DNC email servers almost immediately. Then the Republican candidate departed from all norms of political behavior by any party in America to ask his patron,Russian strongman Vladimir Putin to hack Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign servers, leading almost immediately to another electronic strike. The real question is: why hasn’t the cable television media noticed any of this and taken the time to dig further into the detailed reports, like proof that the Republican candidate faces serious racketeering charges related to Trump University, that long before the suspected labor and immigration violating Trump Models lawsuit, we found evidence of human trafficking practices in the nominee’s reality TV show productions for MTV? Every major newspaper in Florida is calling for a federal investigation of Trump University, but thus far CNN and FOX are more interested in Hillary Clinton’s health and ignoring the actual facts that Donald Trump is 70 years old, lied about his height to hide his obesity, and says that making hand gestures during rallies is “exercise.” CNN’s Stelter replied to Carl Bernstein’s sincere comment with the kind of misguided mainstream media groupthink talking points which might’ve come straight out of a campaign’s deflection and spin files, blaming the reality of Trump’s lifelong con job being under reported on “liberals” wanting to discuss facts. Bernstein shut him down without question: It’s not just liberals, I think it’s conservatives, too, there is realization that trump is a con man. And that that is a big part of the story. Look, we have reported and nobody has been tougher on Hillary Clinton especially on the server question than I, I’ve said it’s indefensible what she did with it, and we have reported on her whole life. She has been around for 25, 30 years in public on the public stage. And we know her every position and record and her life. Trump is different. We haven’t — it’s not equal. It’s disequal that we have allowed Donald Trump to play us like this and we focus on his outrageous statements which we do every day and we give equal time to those on his side and Hillary’s side debating these crazy statements and positions that he changes every day. And we analyze that, but do we go back and look at his whole business record? No. We don’t. It’s sad to watch CNN drown in the effluvia of it’s own conflicted interests, while broadcasting a Trump hotel infomercial live, and without during the hourlong advertisement for the Republican bigot mention that all of its contents were not made in the USA by the xenophobic candidate who advocates protectionism and charges $805 a night to stay in half-finished digs a few blocks from the White House, nor did CNN mention that Trump’s hotel chain is wallowing in vacancy because of the stigma attached to its name. Since when did providing actual facts become just a liberal idea in the media, rather than the purpose of America’s free press? We scratch our heads along with Carl Bernstein. Watch it here:",0,1,0

368,"Washington (CNN)The cast of ""The West Wing"" is back -- but this time, instead of the fictional Jed Bartlet, they're backing a different Democrat for president. Members of the massively popular NBC drama will appear with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at several events in Ohio on Saturday and Sunday. Actors Richard Schiff, Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford, Dulé Hill, Joshua Malina and Mary McCormack will make campaign stops in the Mahoning Valley, Cleveland, Sandusky and Toledo areas on Saturday, and in the Dayton and Columbus areas on Sunday. Joss Whedon's Avengers take shots at Trump in get out the vote video The actors will talk about why they're supporting Clinton and encourage the public to register to vote, according to a campaign statement. This isn't the first time ""West Wing"" -- the plot of which centers on a Democratic presidential administration -- clashes with real life. Janney, who played White House press secretary C.J. Cregg, made an unexpected appearance in the White House press briefing room in April. The surprised press corps had been expecting actual White House spokesman Josh Earnest for their usual press briefing.

1218,"Kim Kardashian is still with her. ""I found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary. I'm with her,"" according to a statement released on Kardashian's website on Saturday. ""I believe Hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. This year, I'm not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision."" Story Continued Below A comment surfaced Friday where the reality-TV star said she was “on the fence” about the presidential election and thinking about changing her vote to Donald Trump. According to comments surfaced by The Huffington Post, Kardashian told Wonderland Magazine that she’s reconsidering her support for Hillary Clinton in the November election, thanks to a conversation she had with stepparent Caitlyn Jenner, the transgender Olympic athlete formerly known as Bruce. Jenner is a Republican. “At first I thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m so Hillary [Clinton],’ but I had a long political call with Caitlyn last night about why she’s voting Trump. I’m on the fence,” Kardashian said, according to HuffPost. Just over a year ago, Kardashian seemed to endorse Clinton, then not yet the Democratic Party’s nominee, on Instagram, posting a selfie with the former secretary of state. Kardashian’s husband, recording artist Kanye West, peered from behind them in the photo. “I got my selfie!!!” an apparently jubilant Kardashian wrote in the post. “I really loved hearing her speak & hearing her goals for our country! #HillaryForPresident.” As of midafternoon Friday, the interview posted on Wonderland’s website did not include any mention of Trump or Clinton, but The Huffington Post reported that it confirmed the statements with the story’s author, Eve Barlow. An editor at Wonderland did not immediately respond to an email from POLITICO seeking clarification. In her conversation with Wonderland, Kardashian sounded off on a few other political issues — including her recent admission that she does not consider herself a feminist (she doesn’t “like labels”) and her husband’s stated interest in running for president in 2020. (She suggests he would probably run as a Democrat, but perhaps an independent. “I don’t know how serious he is about it. We’ll see.”) And asked whether she’s prepared to serve as first lady, Kardashian offered: “Look at all the awful things they’re doing to Melania [Trump], putting up the naked photos [of her] … I’ll say to Kanye: ‘Babe, you know the kind of photos they’d put up of me!’ Haha.”",1,0,0
542,"Donald Trump has just received what has to be his most positive poll of the general election season, showing the Republican nominee opening up a large lead over Hillary Clinton, while support among black voters is soaring to levels Democrats had not thought possible. The new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times “Daybreak” poll released on Sunday shows Trump with a commanding 6.7 percent lead over Clinton, 47.7 percent to 41.0 percent, an indication that Hillary’s collapsing after being forced to leave a 9/11 memorial early is taking its toll, along with the every changing explanations for the health scare from her campaign, which ranged from “overheated” to the flu, to pneumonia. More impressive and yet worrisome for Democrats, and the reason the party, all Democrat Media Complex, and Hillary Clinton herself has been going full-force with the “birther equals racist” narrative, is Trump’s massive gains among black voters in the past week. Trump now has over 20 percent support among black voters, up from only 3 percent just a week ago. Hillary Clinton has 70 percent, significantly lower than the number typically enjoyed by Democrat nominees. Notable is that voters under the age of 35 previously were favored by sizable margins by Clinton, but now the bloviating billionaire and reality TV actor has an 8-point advantage. And among those with a high school education or less, Trump’s support has surged to a 21-point advantage, up from single digits only weeks ago. The LA Times poll has before been favorable to Trump previously, showing the race tighter than most when Clinton was leading significantly. However, this poll, with Trump’s sizable lead and improving performance among black voters, has got to cause panic among Democrats and the Clinton campaign. I thought several times last week that Democrats must be really worried about Trump going after black voters with the focus suddenly being on birtherism — an issue that hadn’t been talked about for several months that the media just recently brought back into the conversation. It’s likely that Clinton’s internal polling was also showing Trump’s surge among black voters even before the LA Times poll. Look for the race card to be ramped up even further in the coming days.

1086,"In preparing for Donald Trump's rumble with Hillary Clinton on Monday night, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Wednesday that her team is ""well acquainted"" with footage of its adversary's past bouts on the debate stage, assessing the former secretary of state's approach as ""so lengthy"" and ""so lawyerly."" Clinton ""got tripped up quite a bit"" in the primary debates against Bernie Sanders, Conway remarked on Fox News Radio's ""Kilmeade & Friends,"" suggesting that the former secretary of state was "" trying to be a little bit more of a centrist, a little bit more of a moderate like her husband was, his winning formula in 1992, not realizing that the modern Democratic Party … would never welcome Bill Clinton 1992 now."" Story Continued Below ""It’s considerably to the left, so she was easily tripped up by Bernie Sanders on foreign policy, on her record of failures. We’re very aware of that,"" Conway said. ""And of course, we’re very aware of Mr. Trump’s both style and his substance in these debates against these other Republicans. He started out at the Fox News debate on Aug. 6, 2015, dead center in the middle because he was leading in the polls, Brian, and he never left that place."" Addressing people who ""are questioning"" Trump's preparation, Conway remarked that the candidates set to appear on stage at Hofstra University are ""two very different people,"" pointing to the Commander in Chief Forum earlier this month as an example. After that event, Conway said, ""all of the polls"" said Trump beat Clinton. ""Why? Well, her answers are so lengthy, they’re so lawyerly,"" Conway continued, noting that Clinton only received ""six or seven questions ... that night because she just takes forever. She’s apologizing, she’s dissembling, she’s deflecting. Donald Trump’s answers are concise and they’re confident, and they’re pointed the way a leader, the way a leader answers questions, frankly."" Asked whether upon reviewing the tapes she could ascertain a difference between Clinton's debate performances in the 2008 cycle and those eight years later, Conway said, ""Clearly."" ""The 2008 Hillary Clinton had the confidence of a frontrunner. This was her race to lose. She was talking more about, remember, she was against same-sex marriage, she had been for closed borders in her career,"" she continued. ""She was, I think at the time even for safe, legal and rare abortions the way her husband tried to pretend he was in the early ‘90s. In 2016, she tried to out-Sanders Sanders, and part of it is because again, how leftward her party has gone, away from the mainstream."" Where Clinton had confidence against Barack Obama and other Democrats on stage in the 2008 cycle, the Clinton of 2016 was ""easily flummoxed by Bernie Sanders,"" Conway said. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, is concerned that moderators might hold the candidates to different standards of scrutiny. ""I think that, my biggest concern is not a view of any moderator but just that people accommodate their questions and lower the bar of their questions to suit the candidate in front of them,"" communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters, going on to say that Trump has been asked easier questions ""because he has not put forward detailed material, which you can … question him on."" Thus, Palmieri continued, Trump ""ends up getting much more one-dimensional, simple questions, and that is not what should be expected of somebody"" participating in a debate for president of the United States. ""And I think the moderators need to ask substantive questions, factual questions, and to keep them on even playing field even though he has failed to put forward the kinds of detailed or multi-tiered policy positions as she has,"" Palmieri added.",1,0,0
797,"The Benghazi fiasco and subsequent lie trail that Hillary Clinton has left in her wake is something I’m sure she wishes would just go away. Luckily, we have patriots all across this great nation that will make sure that never happens. Take this kid for example. His name is Mason and unlike most students his age, he is a conservative through and through. It’s evidenced by his awesome anti-Hillary t-shirt he wore to school. He and his teacher, who is a Liberal (surprise), routinely engaged in political conversations. What happened next is pure awesomeness.   A young man by the name of Mason wore his “Hillary for Prison 2016” shirt to high school one day, which caught the attention of one of his liberal teachers. According to his father’s proud Facebook post, it’s a pro-Hillary teacher whom Mason regularly talks politics with. But during this particular exchange, the teacher got an unexpected, yet, totally epic response. His father sets the scene: So…Mason wore his “Hillary for Prison 2016” shirt to school today. One of his Clinton-supporting teachers whom he’s has political discussions with asked, “Did you wear that for me?” His reply, “No, for Chris Stevens.” Mic drop. Boom! Nice job, Mason! That’s how you stand up to liberal indoctrinators, sometimes known as teachers. Christopher Stevens, of course, was the U.S. Ambassador to Libya that perished in Benghazi on Hillary Clinton’s watch.  This story originated from a Facebook post, but it’s since been taken down. We imagine that Mason and his family didn’t want the publicity, but to be honest, they SHOULD. The liberals tend to act all high and mighty about things like this and showing your conservatism should be celebrated by you, your family, and all other conservatives. Mason, we salute you and hope you continue to show what it truly means to be a patriot in the face of all the lies and hate. (Source: Truth Revolt) h/t Allen B. West ",0,0,1
948,"NEW YORK – All politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top Democrats and Republicans fear that will reshape America’s relationships around the world no matter who wins. This week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim. Story Continued Below On Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko—a clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. She’ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump’s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea. Clinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi—an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she’s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump’s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt’s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America. Keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama’s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator. But none of this compares to the degree to which this year’s race is defined by global affairs – the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy. Clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn’t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them. “She’s very concerned,” said a Clinton aide. “There’s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he’s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.” Certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water’s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America’s borders. “It will have lasting impact,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee “It has been changed,” agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. “It gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.” There has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump’s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico’s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America’s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that’s hardly all. There was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he’s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn’t “understand” NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election. And just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of “playing into the hands” of ISIL. Officials openly wonder what Clinton’s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts? While many in Washington’s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do. Her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they’re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail. Take Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: “It’s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump’s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it’s important from a policy standpoint,” the aide said. If Trump wins, he’ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order. “They will certainly want to see where we’re coming from,” King said. “He will have to clarify and make it clear where he’s coming from.” If Clinton wins, she’ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush. Cardin, who’s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump’s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter. “Can you imagine if Trump were president and we’re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump’s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?” Cardin said. “It’s that type of problems that have now been caused.” This has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he’s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn’t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far. “It's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,” said a senior administration official. “So that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.” From the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba. He’ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning. But the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn’t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn’t run her meetings this week by the White House either. “We’re having a serious debate,” said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama’s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. “We’re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.”",1,0,0
501,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton forced Donald Trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate Monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. Clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of Trump's strongest attacks. She delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" she said. ""And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing."" Trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans. But the debate highlighted Trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the Iraq War and his contention that Clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims at the first debate Appearing in the ""spin room"" after the debate to talk to journalists, Trump said he was happy with his performance. ""It went better than I ever thought,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt Clinton won compared to 27% for Trump. The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCain. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump's recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US -- a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a ""racist lie."" ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton's tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'Holier than thou' ""You treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way,"" he said. ""When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work."" As the debate ended, Clinton hammered Trump over his treatment of women. ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,"" Clinton said. She accused Trump of calling a Latina contestant in a beauty contest ""Miss Piggy"" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing Trump off as he twice asked ""Where did you find this?"" Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. ""I know you live in your own reality,"" she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at Hofstra University on New York's Long Island. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. From there, the drama quickly unfolded. An increasingly angry Trump slammed Clinton for putting her plans to fight ISIS on her website -- and thereby tipping off America's enemy. ""Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" Clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a ""secret"" plan to destroy the terrorist group. Battling over taxes Clinton also hit Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. ""Why won't he release his tax returns?"" Clinton asked. ""Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is,"" she went on. ""Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be,"" ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes."" Clinton pressed Trump on the issue, saying ""There is something he is hiding."" Trump replied that he would release his taxes when Clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. When Clinton said that Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump replied ""That makes me smart."" Clinton also set about Trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself ""The King of Debt"" and accusing him of ""stiffing"" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. When the debate turned to racial issues and crime, Clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. Trump accused Clinton of refusing to say the phrase ""law and order"" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. He said that African-Americans and Hispanics were ""living in hell."" ""You walk down the street, you get shot,"" Trump said. Clinton rebuked Trump for painting ""such a dire picture"" of black communities. Campaign at a critical point Trump and Clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before Election Day. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. In Pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found Clinton in a virtual tie against Trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. The former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Nationally, CNN's Poll of Polls finds Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. Debate prep The rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. Clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide Philippe Reines playing Trump. In one practice debate, Reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising Clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. Reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that Trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare Clinton for her unpredictable foe. The Republican nominee has watched videos of Clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. He did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for Clinton. CNN's Dana Bash, Dylan Byers and Sara Murray contributed to this report",1,0,0
200,"Donald Trump supporters are so desperate to be in power that they are threatening America at gunpoint to vote for him or be killed. Thatâs what Georgia Trump fan Jimmy Arno is preparing for after the election votes are tallied in November because he expects a bloody civil war to break out in order to overthrow the government before Hillary Clinton is inaugurated. Arno is even considering joining a right-wing militia, whom he collectively refers to as âpatriots,â because he seriously believes only they can defend the Constitution. âShould martial law, civil war â whatever â break out in this country, they will uphold the Constitution and rebuild our loss,â he said. âThe war thatâs going to break out if Hillary Clintonâs elected, if that happens. Your patriots are going to overthrow the government.â And of course, Arno is a fan of the Confederacy, loves the Confederate flag, and has a portrait of Robert E. Lee hanging in his living room. So basically, what Arno is saying is that he believes the South will rise again and a civil war sequel will turn out differently. This time a rebellion will somehow succeed even though the United States military, including a navy and air force, would be standing in their way. Nevertheless, threats of civil war and violent rebellion are frightening but they also prove that conservatives are unfit to govern because apparently the only way they can do so is with a gun pressed against the heads of the people. Arno went on to blame President Obama directly for the high racial tensions. âI know that we were a whole lot further along racially eight years ago than we are today,â he claims. But the fact is that Republicans raised those racial tensions themselves by vowing to make President Obama fail from the start simply because of the color of his skin and their claim that he is an illegitimate president. The birther movement, of which Trump is a prominent leader, contends that President Obama is not one of us and that he wasnât born here. The election of President Obama made racists, including Arno, mad so they started publicly throwing a hissy fit and their tantrums have only gotten worse in the last eight years. Hereâs the audio via NPR.  Trump supporters are deplorable people who want to shoot and kill anyone who disagrees with them just so they can watch the world burn. If Hillary Clinton is elected president as she should be, conservatives need to accept that they lost instead of resorting to taking up arms against the country. Such an action is treason and would only demonstrate that they are nothing more than sore losers who should never be allowed to get close to political power ever again. ",0,1,0
1365,"Shimon Peres, whose public career spanned the entire history of the state of Israel, reaching the highest of highs (the Oslo Accord) and the lowest of lows (the assassination of his close colleague Yitzhak Rabin) in the mid-1990s, has died. Peres, who suffered a stroke Sept. 13, was 93. The Jerusalem Post said he ""suffered severe organ failure Tuesday."" Story Continued Below Peres and Rabin shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat “for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East.” Their attempt, backed by President Bill Clinton, at solving the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the biggest breakthrough in the region since the Israel-Egypt accords of 1978 and offered, for a time, hope for better days. Peres, who began his public life in Israel under founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, was twice Israel’s prime minister, in 1984-86 and 1995-96; he was also unofficially the prime minister in 1977. The 1995-96 stint had a tragic air to it — it followed Rabin’s slaying by an Israeli radical and was marked by Palestinian terrorism that, coupled with the assassination, halted momentum toward peace with the Palestinians. Connected to every major leader in Israeli history, Peres served in important government positions over eight decades, finally ending up in 2007 as president. He also had deep connections with the American Jewish community and U.S. political leaders. In 2012, President Barack Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “No individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer,” Obama said. Added Obama: “Shimon Peres — born in a shtetl in what was then Poland, who rose to become president of Israel — he is a dreamer. And rightly so. For he knows what we must never forget: With faith in ourselves and courage in our hearts, no dream is too big, no vision is beyond our reach.” Peres was born Shimon Persky on Aug. 16, 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now part of Belarus). Among his relations: a Perske family in New York City that would yield Betty Jane Perske (born 1924), who achieved enduring fame as the actress Lauren Bacall. Under the sway of Theodor Herzl’s Zionist philosophy, his family emigrated to Palestine in 1934. “To us,” Peres wrote in ""The Imaginary Voyage,"" his 2000 book about him, “Herzl was an exceptional person, a kind of prince in exile or a king without a crown who had pointed out the route his people should follow.” In 1942, the remaining Jews in Peres’ hometown, including his grandfather, were exterminated by the Nazis. Peres lived on a kibbutz and, in 1945, he married Sonia Gelman. In 1947, Peres joined the Haganah, which had been formed as a Zionist self-defense organization and was now at the forefront of Jewish efforts to prepare for the inevitable fight for statehood. The United Nations approved a resolution calling for the partition of Palestine into two states in November 1947, and Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israel’s independence in May 1948. War followed, and Israel emerged from it a nation. Ben-Gurion appointed Peres director of naval services in 1948. “David Ben-Gurion was a mythic figure, the founding father of Israel and a modern-day prophet, but he was also a real man who stormed through history on human legs,” wrote Peres in his 2011 biography of his mentor. “It was my great privilege to know him and work with him for many years.” Peres served the young nation in just about every way imaginable, including a stint representing the Defense Ministry in the United States. He served in the Knesset (parliament) from 1959, and also as leader or deputy leader of Defense, Immigrant Absorption, Finance, Information, and Transport and Communication. A hawk on defense, Peres was known for his efforts to improve Israeli forces. In July 1976, he was Rabin’s defense minister when Israel launched a daring raid to rescue hostages held at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. Rabin was soon hit by a financial scandal, and Peres unofficially replaced him until elections could be held. In May 1977, Peres led the Labor coalition to its first-ever defeat, losing to Menachem Begin’s Likud Party. It was a setback that was to be repeated: For all his accomplishments, Peres couldn’t win over Israel’s voters. “He comes across,” wrote Marcus Eliason for The Associated Press in 1980, “as a technocrat, as much at home with the silicon chip as with French literature. Technology fascinates him, be it the atomic bomb or the zip code.” After Begin defeated him again in 1981, Peres took on Begin’s successor, Yitzhak Shamir, in 1984. This time, neither coalition was able to secure a majority, so a unity government was formed, with Peres serving the first 25 months as prime minister and the next 25 as Shamir’s vice premier/foreign minister. As prime minister, Peres withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon and improved relations with Morocco and Egypt. As foreign minister in 1987, he negotiated a secret peace deal with Jordan’s King Hussein that was designed to pave the way for Palestinian talks. That agreement was scuttled by Shamir, who then secured his hold on the prime minister’s job in 1988. In 1992, a revitalized Rabin was elected prime minister. Peres became his foreign minister, and secret talks with Palestinians began at an isolated farmhouse in Norway. The Associated Press later reported “only 10 people in Israel knew that one of the Middle East’s most enduring taboos had been broken: Israel was talking to the PLO.” A breakthrough came in August 1993, followed by a Sept. 13 ceremony on the White House lawn where Rabin and Arafat shook hands in front of Clinton. ”The signing of the Israel-PLO accord is more than a political milestone,” Peres wrote in Tikkun magazine. “It is a transformative event which touches every Jewish family — physically, emotionally, spiritually.” Some Jews feared the Oslo Accord would lead to the destruction of Israel; their objections were mirrored among those Arabs who adamantly rejected Israel’s right to exist. But things seemed to be on track as the deals were followed by further agreements, as well as a landmark treaty with Jordan. Then came Rabin’s assassination by radical Jewish right-winger Yigal Amir on Nov. 4, 1995, and Israeli society was turned upside down. According to the book ""Murder in the Name of God"" by Michael Karpin and Ina Friedman, Amir and his fellow plotters considered whether Peres should be killed along with Rabin. The decision, however, was made for Amir: As a giant peace rally in Tel Aviv ended, the two leaders left separately. Karpin and Friedman described the moment: “As Yigal Amir sat on the concrete flower pot in the parking area, Shimon Peres descended the steps beside him. Amir noticed there was only one bodyguard with him and no policemen. Yigal’s arm moved to act, but he held back. Peres’s bodyguard cast a suspicious glance at him. ‘For God’s sake, what’s that dark guy doing down there? Is he one of us?’ the bodyguard whispered into his tiny microphone.” Shortly thereafter, Rabin exited and was gunned down by Amir. As Israel went into a period of mourning, debate and pained soul-searching, Peres became prime minister again. “I shared with him days of worry and grief,” Peres said of Rabin in addressing a joint session of Congress in December 1995. “I shared with him hours of reflection and decision. We complemented each other in a determined pursuit of the only objective worthy of the task bestowed upon us by the people of Israel: to carve a new era of security in peace, to build bridges across an Arab-Israeli divide, an impossible divide. And he, the captain, is no more.” Months later, Peres was ousted. He had confidently called for new elections, only to see his standing in the polls badly damaged by a rise in Palestinian terror attacks. Buoyed by opposition to Oslo, Benjamin Netanyahu prevailed in elections in May 1996. As would-be peace partners, Netanyahu and Arafat were mismatched and distrustful. The promise of 1993 disintegrated. After the electoral rebuke, Peres remained on Israel’s public stage. In 1996, he founded the Peres Center for Peace, an organization designed to promote peace with Israel’s neighbors, as well as between Jews and Arabs within Israel. He served as president from 2007 until his retirement in July 2014. Even after his retirement, he remained an advocate for finding a peaceful solution. ""The alternative to two states is a continued war,"" he told The Associated Press in November 2015, ""and nobody can maintain a war forever. If you say we should live on our sword don't forget that there are other swords as well."" In August 2016, at the age of 93, he announced he had joined Snapchat. ""Today all the young people are on Snapchat, and I am happy to be there with them,"" Peres said in explaining that he always wanted to stay on the cutting edge of technology. In 1996, Peres and King Hussein were awarded the annual Liberty Medal in Philadelphia for their peace efforts. In 2008, Peres received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2013, Clinton saluted him for his 90th birthday: “You are the world’s social Einstein. You have tried to put together a unified theory of meaning to unite politics and philosophy and psychology and history and science and technology. Every one of us who has been blessed enough to know you … has been made a little bigger, a little stronger and a little more optimistic that one day your theory will be real,” he told Peres in Jerusalem, according to Haaretz. “When I was a child, Israel was a legend more than a reality,” Peres said at that gala. “She emerged from a dream, and today she has surpassed that dream.” Peres’ wife, Sonia, died in 2011; the couple had three children.",1,0,0

So what do they think about the pressing questions facing this country in 2016 and beyond? Where do they stand on Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump? Where would Barack Obama rank on an all-time list of presidents? What single word best describes the respective states of our two political parties? Of all the challenges facing America right now, which one is the biggest? And what issue is most likely to surprise us in 2017? We asked The Politico 50, and although they have very different ideas and backgrounds—from entertainers to academics to lawyers to professional agitators—there are areas where they agree. Ninety-eight percent, for instance, said that Russia is an international menace. Seventy-three percent said that, on balance, international trade deals help America. Fifty-three percent said that Bernie Sanders’ candidacy ultimately helped the Democratic Party. And The Politico 50, on average, are quite worried about the prospect of a Trump presidency. But there are many points of dispute across a broad swath of issues and interests, whether it’s the sleeper issue driving the election, Trump’s greatest strength as a candidate or Obama’s biggest piece of unfinished business in the White House.

Let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016  Let’s be very clear. The United States does not have a Syrian refugee problem. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States, all of which have been committed by naturalized citizens, but the Donald Trump campaign continues to demonize these desperate people trying to escape the appalling bloodshed in their homeland. As NPR noted, “the odds of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack are about 1 in more than 3.6 billion, according to a recent Cato Institute study.” The company which makes Skittles, Wrigley’s, reached out to Hollywood reporter Seth Abramovitch with this epic response, which really says it all.  For the so-called party of “family values” to be fear-mongering over women and children running for their lives is the height of hypocrisy. We’d like to see a self-entitled dandy like Donald Trump Jr. walk a day in their shoes. Here’s the somber reality of the situation: @DonaldJTrumpJr This is the refugee crisis. Not skittles.

1584,"Tony Stewart is still fighting to remain in the Chase, and so far it doesn’t look very promising. Tony Stewart has had an interesting season to say the least. What started out not very promising thanks to a back injury has now turned into him being in the running towards a championship. Over the years Smoke has been involved in many controversial things. From being accused and admitting to wrecking people intentionally to being involved with a man being hit on the track, resulting in the end of his life. Overall, Tony has seen some pretty harsh things. And that can take a toll on a guy. However, he still manages to give back to people in the most amazing ways!  In a recent event, it looks like Smoke’s giving saved a life. According to a racing team first responder, Jay Masur, Tony Stewart’s lending of equipment saved his life. Masur has been a first responder for years. He’s seen first hand just how dangerous racing is. He’s also been in instances where Tony Stewart is the one he’s responding to. Now it looks like the roles have reversed. Masur was responding to an incident on a dirt track when he lost control of his four wheeler, causing him to fly off into the air and on the ground.  Now you may be wondering where Tony Stewart fits into all of this. A few years before this incident, Masur responded to one of Smoke’s wrecks and reportedly saved his life. That’s how Tony felt at least. So after everything was said and done, Smoke bought Masur and his team top of the line equipment. That equipment, including a helmet, is what Masur claims saved his life. “I believe I swerved to miss something and flew off the four wheeler and ended up hitting my head pretty hard. I believe this helmet probably saved my life, there’s no doubt. We all feel like, we’re bullet proof, we all feel, in the jobs we do, it can’t happen to us, because we’re pretty good at our stuff, but no matter how much we prepare, how much we plan, things happen, and at the end of the day, love your family, treat every day like it’s the last day on earth, because it may be. We saved [Tony’s] life and I truly believe he had a huge part in saving mine.” WOW! That’s amazing. Tony has yet to speak out about this incident, but we can only imagine how he feels.

120,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists. Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer. But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things. Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. [â¦] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomasâ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case. Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomasâ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the manâs life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

I’m guessing that was his way of pushing the idea that Hillary’s health issues are nothing more than the flu or bad cold.   Hillary of course laughed her cackling laugh with the audience and then Fallon high-fived her. After touching her hand, Fallon reached under the desk for some hand sanitizer.

Voters DO have a right to be concerned and many medical professionals are: Hillary’s Health Concerns Serious, Say Most Doctors Polled by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) Concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health are “serious—could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S.,” say nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). About 20% said concerns were “likely overblown, but should be addressed as by full release of medical records.” Only 2.7% responded that they were “just a political attack; I have confidence in the letter from her physician and see no cause for concern.” While more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion, only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis, and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis. More than 78% said the health concerns had received “not enough emphasis” in the media, and only 2.7% that there had been “too much emphasis.” So THIS is how you treat the Presidency of the United States. Make fun of voters concerns over the health of candidates who may become President of the United States.

815,"Hillary Clinton appeared on Steve Harvey on Tuesday and expressed the feeling that she wanted to be instrumental in improving policing tactics in the United States. Specifically she was referencing the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma by a white female police officer. It is now dominating the news as leftists and Black Lives Matter activists are simultaneously going crazy. She said, “How many times do we have to see this in our country? This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable. Maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘Look this is not who we are.’ We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. We can do better. We have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable.” It is funny how she almost appears to be endorsing the idea that African American people are unjustly oppressed and discriminated against in the United States. Black people often say that one black person is not representative of the entire African American race. Yet, she thinks that as a white woman she can speak for all white people? That is pretty ignorant. Not even considering the fact that more people in her party like Senator Bernie Sanders than her. Crutcher’s family released the violent video of his death at the hands of a police officer on Tuesday. The Tulsa Police Chief said to the media during a press conference that no firearm was found at the scene of the shooting. The police officer indicated she shot Crutcher because he motioned his hand into the car as if to grab something which she had believed was a firearm. Which would seem to corroborate the belief that Crutcher was unarmed and not a danger to the police officers. To think that all one needs to do is “talk to white people” in order to quell the issue of systemic racism or brutality against African Americans is absolutely ludicrous. You would think that for a seasoned politician Clinton would understand that it is actions and not words that effect real change. But Clinton is usually all talk and no walk.

1092,"Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing. Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved. ""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest."" The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28. Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating. While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel. The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court. Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.",1,0,0

827,"Man, at this rate I’m going to run out of places to shop. Walmart proved and admitted they have cop-hating asshats working for them. This one happened in Georgia… the daughter of an officer who is retiring went to get him a cake. On it, it said ‘Blue Lives Matter’ with a think blue line on a black background. What the hell is racist about that? Three workers (who should all be fired) refused to decorate the cake for the retirement party. These morons don’t seem to actually know the definition of ‘racist’. What’s worse is Walmart admits this happened. This officer served faithfully on the force, risking his life every day for 25 years. And these mush heads decided that they were too offended to do a cake for a police officer. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter said. Then they should not be working there. Shame on Walmart for not firing these three cop-haters. From Todd Starnes: Three Walmart workers in McDonough, Georgia refused to decorate a “thin blue line” cake for a police officer’s retirement party because they said it was racist. A number of my Georgia readers alerted me to the story and on Saturday night I spoke directly with the police officer’s daughter. She asked that I not divulge her name and I’ve agreed to honor her request. “I was so shocked,” she told me. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” “The baker told me the blue line cake was racist” — POLICE OFFICER’S DAUGHTER “I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.” As an alternative, the officer’s daughter suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. But that design was also rejected by Walmart’s cake decorator. “She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter said. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?’” After being rejected for a third time, the 21 year-old told the bakers, “I’ll find another bakery, thank you.” That Walmart should be boycotted. It’s in McDonough, Georgia on Willow Drive for those of you who would like to let them know how you feel about this outrageous behavior. The officer’s daughter was far more polite than I would have been. I would have gladly made a huge, ongoing scene and then I would have called the media. Then I would have gone to social media with it. I would have shamed them to hell and back. “I was disappointed,” she told me. “I go to Walmart all the time — at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much I appreciated him.” This just pisses me off. A friend of the family did indeed put this on Facebook and what do you know… management called the police officer’s wife and daughter and apologized. Sort of. “He said he was so sorry,” the daughter said. “He offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card.” Walmart confirmed the story, but they did not admit their employees called the cake racist. Only that the employee made a ‘mistake’. Damn right they did… I’d still boycott them. Now, for the cherry on this cake. The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “It doesn’t look professional.” In the end, the daughter did not have time to get a cake after all this. Walmart should be ashamed. “It irritates me that in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them,” she said. “And you can’t make a cake for the people who are protecting you?” Walmart has hired a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots. They need to be fired and Walmart needs to make this right.  ",0,0,1

946,"Donald Trump has unleashed an unprecedented deluge of small-dollar donations for the GOP, one that Republican Party elders have dreamed about finding for much of the past decade as they’ve watched a succession of Democrats — Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders and, to a lesser extent, Hillary Clinton — develop formidable fundraising operations $5, $10 and $20 at a time. Trump has been actively soliciting cash for only a few months, but when he reveals his campaign’s financials later this week they will show he has crushed the total haul from small-dollar donors to the past two Republican nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney — during the entirety of their campaigns. Story Continued Below All told, Trump is approaching, or may have already passed, $100 million from donors who have given $200 or less, according to an analysis of available Federal Election Commission filings, the campaign’s public statements and people familiar with his fundraising operation. It is a threshold no other Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign. And Trump has done so less than three months after signing his first email solicitation for donors on June 21 — a staggering speed to collect such a vast sum. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” said a senior Republican operative who has worked closely with the campaign’s small-dollar fundraising operation. “He’s the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraising.” Clinton counted 2.3 million donors as of the end of August, the result of decades of campaigning, a previous presidential bid and allies who painstakingly built her an email file of supporters even before she formally announced her second run. But Trump had zoomed to 2.1 million donors in the past three months alone, his campaign has said. The question now is what the gusher means for the GOP. The Republican National Committee, through a deal struck with Trump in May, is getting 20 percent of the proceeds from its small-donor operation for Trump plus access to this invaluable new donor and email file. But can Trump’s candidacy help close the Republican Party’s small-donor divide in one fell swoop? Will these donors — 2.1 million and counting — give to other Republicans? Will they drag the Republican Party in Trump’s direction for years to come? Or, if he loses, will they simply vanish? “The challenge is that we still have a divided party,” said Mindy Finn, who led Romney’s digital team in 2008 and worked for George W. Bush’s reelection in 2004. Trump has found record-setting success as the first Republican nominee “in the Internet age” to have made empowering the grass roots and railing against the elite a core of his campaign message, Finn said. Going forward, the key will be whether his donors can be convinced to give to a candidate with just a bit less bombast. “Can you be a populist without being a barnburner?” she asked. “And thus still be able to raise this kind of money?” Or, as a second operative who has worked with Trump’s small-dollar fundraising operation, put it, “I don’t know how much these Trump donors — if he doesn’t win — want to give to the RNC.” Trump, a self-proclaimed billionaire who bragged during the primaries about how he didn’t need anyone else’s cash to run for president, would appear at first to be the unlikeliest of Republican fundraising heroes. But the combination of his celebrity, anti-establishment populism, and running against Clinton has led to a windfall, even as his skeletal campaign did little for more than a year to cultivate a donor list or build digital infrastructure to lure contributors. “People are pouring in, and we’re having to manage the inflow,” said one of the operatives familiar with the Trump operation. It is impossible to piece together a complete picture of Trump’s finances due to different reporting deadlines for Trump’s various committees. But as of the end of July, he had amassed $50 million in small contributions into his campaign, FEC records show. He has since announced he raised $90 million in August “mostly” from small donors both directly for his campaign and in joint committees shared with the Republican National Committee — suggesting at least $45 million raised last month came from small contributors. Additionally, there is some money from small contributors in those shared RNC accounts — Trump said they contained $37 million at the end of July — that he has helped raise. Trump’s success dwarfs those of his GOP predecessors. McCain and Romney, in 2008 and 2012, respectively, raised just less than $64 million in contributions of $200 or less, according to FEC records (McCain, notably, accepted public funds in the 2008 general election). Trump still lags far behind the pace-setting Democrats. President Obama raised an enormous $483.6 million in contributions of $200 or less in 2012, FEC records show. Sanders raised almost $202 million in small donations just during the 2016 primary. And Clinton raised almost $156 million in such contributions through the end of July, according to the FEC. Democrats seem to vacillate between comforting themselves with all that Trump continues to do wrong — botching Mike Pence’s announcement, the high spam rate on their first email, the volume of ads targeting Democrats — and concern about his successes in spite of that. “I would just put it in the perspective of they’re still not doing as well as they should be doing, and they’re doing too little too late,” said Kenneth Pennington, who served as digital director for Sanders. “Once they start copying some of the things Democrats are doing, then I’ll get worried.” Trump is certainly spending big to raise small money. In July, he poured $8.4 million into his San Antonio-based digital firm, Giles-Parscale, most of which was spent on online advertising and prospecting for donors. People familiar with the Trump operation say that the campaign has essentially told digital vendors that it will run as many Facebook and Google ads as possible, so long as investing in the particular ad is generating positive cash flow, or return on investment. “We’ve had a positive ROI on everything,” said one Trump campaign official. Brad Parscale, who runs the Trump digital operation and began working for the Trump family before it entered politics, has increasingly begun traveling to New York and accumulating power within the campaign. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. visited Parscale’s operation in San Antonio to thank the employees, and RNC officials, dispatched there. “Every time there’s been a change in leadership, he’s gotten significantly more authority,” an operative who has worked with the campaign said of Parscale. Of course, the ever-increasing flow of money to Trump Tower has certainly helped. On Aug. 31, the day Trump went to Mexico and the last day of the reporting period that will be revealed this week, Trump raised an enormous $5 million. The campaign ran a dizzying 107,000 different ad combinations on Facebook on that day alone, according to Lindsay Walters, a Republican National Committee spokeswoman, swapping out different text, graphics and videos to determine what performed strongest. A typical day involves 40,000 to 50,000 such combinations, Walters said. Another person familiar with the Trump and RNC digital operation said there has been some strain simply creating content fast enough to fill all the ad slots that are making them money. In an atypical arrangement for a presidential campaign, the RNC is actually taking a cut of all the small-dollar fundraising done through its joint committee with Trump (Romney received 100 percent of the joint committee’s small donations, in contrast). The agreement was struck back in May, when Trump emerged as the nominee with little infrastructure or experience to execute a large-scale digital operation. As a result, the RNC will end 2016 will access to a far larger email and donor file than ever before. “A lot of them probably don’t realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the RNC; otherwise they probably wouldn’t give,” said one of the operatives who has worked with Trump and the RNC. “People are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because Donald Trump’s name is on it.” Indeed, almost all of the ads prominently incorporate Trump’s image or name — offering dinner with Trump, coffee with Ivanka Trump, lunch with Eric Trump. And the appeals aren’t just for petty cash. Trump has run an extensive email campaign asking for $184 for signed copies of “The Art of the Deal” — an unusually large sum to seek online. “We wouldn’t be running all that stuff if it wasn’t working,” said a person who has worked with the campaign. In a sign of the potency of Trump’s name, others are trying to capitalize as well. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans, has been blitzing its own email list with Trump-themed missives. So far in September, the NRSC has offered Trump-Pence yard signs, bumper stickers, bracelets, magnets and T-shirts, even as strategists have urged Senate candidates themselves to distance themselves from Trump on the trail. Other, insurgent-style Republicans have found success among small donors in the past. Ben Carson’s primary campaign floundered but he still raised $48 million among those who gave $200 or less. Ted Cruz raised more than $60 million from such givers before he dropped out. That is the catch-22 for a Republican establishment that, thanks to Trump, is now awash in a potentially powerful list of new givers — the energy and money is for the anti-establishment candidates. Fred Malek, a top Republican presidential fundraiser for decades, said Trump’s singular appeal to small donors could be just that. “It seems to me that it is not necessarily transferrable,” he said.",1,0,0
160,"While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland, Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement â and itâs gotten him in trouble with Americaâs largest police union. In speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland, Trump strayed from his normal, pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby, the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man. Clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed, Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors, in which he suggested that Shelby had âchokedâ: âNow, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they canât be doing what theyâre doing, okay? They canât be doing what theyâre doing. I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up.Â That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything youâre supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man.â Trump made these comments just five days after theÂ Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which has 330,000 members, endorsed him. But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer, FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trumpâs comments were inappropriate. Pasco said that TrumpÂ âmust be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.â Now, no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims â heâs been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment, and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly. This speech was easy for Trump to say in front of black pastors â I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience. Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote, which may very well determine this election. Trump will say whatever he needs to win â but this time, he lost a major support group. Hereâs the clip that got Trump in trouble with the police union:  ",0,1,0

892,"Legendary singer Barbara Streisand penned an op-ed for the Huffington Post today in which she paints a distinct portrait between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, disparaging the mandarin mogul for his cowardice and bigotry while praising the former Secretary of State for her strength and resolve. He’s basically a bully, but like all bullies, he’s a coward at heart. He skipped out on a debate because he didn’t like the moderator. He can’t handle the tough questions. He’s so thin-skinned that as soon as anyone challenges him, he sues them. Hillary has been attacked right and left for decades and is still standing. She has negotiated with leaders around the world to keep us safe from nuclear threat because it would destroy the planet… while he shockingly said, “If we have nuclear weapons, why can’t we use them?” And he has the nerve to call her “trigger-happy”? “Unstable”? His ignorance is astounding. Streisand then touches on the undercurrent of sexism that has dogged the Clinton campaign and her entire political career, rightfully pointing out that old white men are deeply suspicious of powerful women, afraid they will be treated the way that they treat women. So how come Hillary is not getting credit for all her accomplishments? It goes back to something I’ve felt for many years…strong women, powerful women have always been suspect. Some men are challenged by strong women… afraid of them… and some women are jealous of them. Strong women have too many opinions for some people… they prefer women who are quiet. They want us to speak less and smile more. After Hillary answered questions on national security, Reince Priebus complained that she didn’t smile enough. Well, guess what… there was nothing to smile about. As she said, this is serious business. And Trump says Hillary doesn’t look presidential? What does that mean… coming from a guy who looks like a raccoon in a tanning bed… with a flying squirrel on his head? That’s what a president is supposed to look like? A wrestler who dies his hair blonde? Republicans play dirty and their smear tactics unfortunately work. As they say, “If you repeat a lie long enough and loud enough, people will believe it.” And that’s what’s happening and it’s terrifying. We can’t allow ourselves to be swiftboated again. We can’t let that happen to Hillary… a woman who has the temperament and the experience to be president… unlike Donald Trump, whose idea of foreign policy was bringing the Miss Universe pageant to Russia. How can you support a man who says, “Women… you have to treat them like sh—“ and believes such hateful things about 51 percent of the American population? We cannot allow America to fall into the hands of a narcissist who has shown no regard for anyone but himself… a bigoted and misogynist reality-TV character with no political experience and no qualms about lying loudly and often. There is NO equivalency between these two candidates. Only Hillary Clinton has the skills, the knowledge, the temperament and the compassion to lead this nation. She’s absolutely right. Donald Trump is the complete opposite of everything our nation stands for, while Hillary Clinton embodies leadership and strength in an obvious way that must make Trump feel like a chump with tiny hands.",0,1,0

409,"Washington (CNN)Syria's prolonged and bloody civil war ""haunts"" President Barack Obama, he told an interviewer this month, though he isn't naming any specific policy change he believes could have stemmed the suffering there. Speaking with presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin for Vanity Fair, Obama said the grim situation in Syria ""haunts me constantly."" ""I would say of all the things that have happened during the course of my presidency, the knowledge that you have hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed, millions who have been displaced, (makes me) ask myself what might I have done differently along the course of the last five, six years,"" he said. Obama's efforts to ease the humanitarian crisis in Syria have largely fallen short since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad turned violent five years ago. The latest attempt with Russia to broker peace in Syria is unraveling amid mutual recriminations. ""The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong,"" he said. ""But I do ask myself, 'Was there something that we hadn't thought of? Was there some move that is beyond what was being presented to me that maybe a Churchill could have seen, or an Eisenhower might have figured out?'"" ""That's the kind of thing that tends to occupy me when I have the time to think about it,"" he said. ""Usually, I'm pretty good about sorting through the options and then making decisions that I'm confident are the best decisions in that moment, given the information we have. But there are times where I think I wish I could have imagined a different level of insight."" Obama 'skeptical' of policy changes Over the course of the civil war, Obama has considered taking strikes against Assad's positions as a consequence for the regime's use of chemical weapons on civilians, and has weighed arming various rebel factions who are battling the government. In the interview, Obama said he was ""skeptical"" taking those actions could have made any real difference in the war. Syria's crisis consumed much of the President's time this week at his final United Nations General Assembly, where he worked to convince his foreign counterparts to step up their commitments for accepting refugees from the war-torn country. He said during a special session on the refugee crisis that the world had come up short in its response. ""We all know that what is happening in Syria ... is unacceptable,"" he said.

1350,"MIAMI — Donald Trump’s aides are discussing the possibility of asking him to write his biggest check yet to his own campaign to fund an ad blitz, and the billionaire candidate is open to the possibility, according to three people close to the nominee. While Trump’s campaign has experienced a surge in small-dollar fundraising this month that could make an infusion of personal cash unnecessary, major Republican donors are nervous after a rocky first debate against Hillary Clinton and could ramp up pressure on their nominee to invest in the air war. Story Continued Below Trump’s campaign last week said that it was planning a $140-million television and digital advertising push between this week and Election Day, in an effort to cut into the massive advertising advantage enjoyed by Clinton. But entering this month, the campaign did not have the money in the bank to pay for the effort, which would represent by far its most ambitious advertising push of the 2016 election. Trump’s most recent Federal Election Commission filing shows that his campaign had only $50 million in the bank at the end of August. Since then, his small-dollar online fundraising has been especially brisk, raising the prospect that Trump might not need to fund the ad buys from his own pocket — or might only need to cover part of it, according to the three people close to the candidate. They suggested that Trump is amenable to either possibility — even if it means writing his biggest check of the campaign to date. Trump relied heavily on his own fortune through the bitter GOP primary, during which he loaned his campaign $43.5 million of his own money. A central tenet of his candidacy was that his ability to self-finance his White House bid made him independent from major donors to whom he suggested his rivals were beholden. Since then, though, Trump has scaled back his self-financing, giving his campaign only about $2 million a month, which he has cast as putting up his own money to match contributions from small donors. Republican insiders in interviews have expressed doubt about Trump’s willingness to inject larger sums of his own cash into the race. His campaign issued another monthly $2-million challenge to small donors on Tuesday, promising in an email that their contributions “will be instantly matched for double the impact in our race to defeat Hillary Clinton.” Indeed, in combination with the Republican National Committee, the campaign has invested heavily in a small-dollar online fundraising operation, which has produced big numbers, and has helped narrow Clinton’s gaping fundraising lead. The Trump campaign declined to comment on its September fundraising or how much of his own money Trump was prepared to spend. One of the people close to Trump said the real estate developer and reality TV star is “prepared to do whatever it takes personally to win. But the cash has been pouring in and we have a lot more cash than people think. Now, there’s actually cash there to pay for the $140 million.” The person rejected a suggestion that the $140-million advertising plan was not realistic, but rather was intended to assuage worried donors and to worry Clinton’s forces. “That was not a head fake,” said the person. Still, Trump’s team has only slowly begun investing in some of the trappings of traditional presidential campaigns, and he continues to brag about how little he’s spent relative to Clinton. The Democrat, Trump alleged during Monday’s debate has “spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.” Yet, he said, “the only gratifying thing is I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money … I'm either winning or tied. And I’ve spent practically nothing.” In fact, Trump’s campaign had spent $119 million overall through the end of August, but its advertising budget has been a fraction of that of Clinton’s campaign. Through the end of last week, Clinton’s campaign had spent more than five times the $22 million that Trump has spent on TV and radio ads for the general election, according to Kantar Media. And the gap appears to be widening, even as Trump’s fundraising has taken off. In the 10 days leading up to the debate, Clinton’s campaign aired 12,812 ads on local television in the 61 top markets, compared to 1,378 for Trump, according to the tracking company Media Monitors. Trump's planned $140-million ad buy will focus on 13 states, including battlegrounds like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also Maine, New Mexico and Wisconsin, according to an Associated Press report. Jessica Ditto, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, told POLITICO that last week it began reserving $100 million in television advertising and $40 million in digital ads, with the first $15-million-worth placed Friday. “The broadcast/cable ratio will continue to fluctuate in line with targeting needs,” Ditto said. Ad buying data provided to POLITICO does not reflect the full weight of the buy yet. It indicates that Trump’s campaign has purchased roughly $9.8 million in advertising between Tuesday and Election Day, compared to $41 million over that same period for Clinton’s campaign.",1,0,0
998,"John McCain has made 3 million voter contacts in Arizona. Rob Portman marshaled 500 college interns to make phone calls and knock on doors in Ohio. And Pat Toomey barnstormed 26 Pennsylvania counties this summer in a bus plastered with the words “security, prosperity, independence.” Then there’s Richard Burr. Story Continued Below Republicans are privately fretting that the laid-back Burr isn’t campaigning aggressively enough for his third Senate term and potentially risking a GOP seat that the party should otherwise have in the bag. But — in his usual easygoing form — Burr brushed off any concerns about national Democrats spending at least $6.7 million to unseat him — a forceful play to make a red-leaning state competitive less than two months before the election. “It’s great. I think anytime they waste money it saves my colleagues from having it go after them,” Burr smirked when asked of Democrats’ money blitz. “Am I complaining that the last [Quinnipiac] poll had me up 6? No! I’m probably in better shape than we dreamed.” The Senate Intelligence chairman risks getting caught flat-footed against a relatively unknown opponent in North Carolina, which has become a major target for Democrats eyeing the White House, Senate and the governor’s mansion in Raleigh. But Burr comes by his laid-back attitude honestly — quirks and all. He doesn’t wear socks, except on certain Thursdays. He’ll bring his own lunch to caucus meetings to save a few bucks on the catered food and sometimes walks around the Capitol chowing on grits. And he drives a ramshackle convertible Volkswagen Thing in rain, sun and snow despite the inoperable roof, leaving it in areas that could not even under the most charitable definition be called a parking spot. The car is covered with bumper stickers, including one supporting conservative Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. “The best way to describe Richard is to look at the car he drives,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a longtime friend. “He’s a workhorse, not a show horse. If you don’t believe me go look at his car. Which is a piece of crap.” But no matter how well-liked Burr is, he’s in a competitive race against Democrat Deborah Ross, a former state representative who has sneaked up on Burr and trails by about 3 points according to averages of recent polls. And national Democrats are going after him because Ohio has essentially been conceded to the Republicans, Florida is exceedingly expensive and they are searching for any path to the majority. The race is viewed as an essential piece of either party’s majority: if Democrats can’t take advantage of Burr’s vulnerability, party honchos will kick themselves for leaving a winnable seat on the table. And if Republicans were to lose in North Carolina, it would presage a bad night for them on Nov. 8. Plus, the state’s environment is rapidly deteriorating around Burr. GOP Gov. Pat McCrory appears the most vulnerable incumbent governor, Donald Trump is being badly outspent by Hillary Clinton and the GOP’s so-called bathroom law is now denying the state prized NCAA tournament events. Burr again declined to take a position on the controversial law, known as HB2, last week. “The state is on fire,” Ross said in a telephone interview. “North Carolina has the most statewide races that are the closest in the entire country right now.” The political landscape is threatening enough, but GOP insiders say Burr has exacerbated the problem by never deviating from his lax demeanor. Burr says this is his last political campaign ever -- but Republicans privately say it’s hard to tell how much he cares about the outcome. “In this environment you would prefer to have all of your candidates running terrified, and no one would say that he is doing that,” said one top Republican strategist. “He’s not working as hard as he should,” added another. Burr attended a Senate Republican fundraiser on Sea Island, Ga., as his colleagues spent the past weekend campaigning. Burr “should have been in North Carolina,” said a third Republican strategist. The senator himself said that national Republicans don’t understand his strategy. His aides said he did 26 events in the first three weeks of August, though at one of them he told The Associated Press that he doesn’t become a candidate until the Senate goes on recess in October. Was that a mistake? “Absolutely not. Has my campaign been running? Yeah it’s been running. When do I have time to go down and be a candidate? I’ve got a full-time job up here,” Burr said. “What I was trying to say was, I go out and do Senate business, don’t come up and ask me campaign questions. Because I’m not a candidate, I’m doing official business.” The 60-year-old Burr is something of a throwback on Capitol Hill, a longtime friend of former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) who views politicking a distant second to the daily ins-and-outs of being a powerful Intel chairman. A national sales manager for a lawn equipment distributor before entering politics, Burr ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1992, but won a House seat just two years later and served there for a decade before running for the Senate in 2004. Burr is boosted by the fact that he’s well-respected by Democrats — the biggest diss that Democratic senators can come up with is that he’s not well-known in the state. In a September Suffolk poll, Burr was unknown by 13 percent of respondents, but Ross was worse off with 45 percent of them saying they’d never heard of her. Still, he led by 3 points in that survey, and Ross has more room to grow her support. “The more they see of her, the more they’re going to like her,” said one Democratic senator. “I don’t know the state of his campaign, I just know there’s a lot of persuadables in North Carolina.” The most stunning sign of GOP hand-wringing is an $8.1 million ad buy reserved by the Senate Leadership Fund — more than the group is spending on races in the traditional battlegrounds of Nevada and Pennsylvania. And according to Republican officials, pro-Trump forces have reserved only $3.2 million in ads in the state, while pro-Clinton forces have reserved $21.2 million. Republicans supporting Burr and the candidate himself, however, have about $20 million in ads scheduled to run this year, compared with about $9 million for Democrats. And Burr has a built-in money advantage, with $7 million on hand to Ross’ $2 million at the end of June, and is now up on TV. But Burr has been hampered by another troubling statistic: Ross outraised him the past two quarters, a major accomplishment for a candidate in a first-time race and a troubling one for a longtime politician. Democrats say they have benefited from Ross’ obscurity; had former Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) or former Rep. Heath Shuler (D-N.C.) got in the race, Burr may have been startled into an overwhelming show of force early on. But now in the midst of the sprint to November, Ross is in serious contention. “She’s very good. She’s very sharp,” said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester of Montana. “The next seven weeks are critical, but she’s a great candidate and she’s absolutely in the mix. Seven weeks is a long time, but I think that long time helps her a lot.” Republicans read things another way -- that they will use the next seven weeks to stir up inflammatory pieces of Ross’ record, which includes running the state’s American Civil Liberties Union, opposing a sex-offender registry and efforts to ban flag burning. GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina called her a “no-compromises ultraliberal” – and Republicans said after they are done with her, voters will figure she’s too left for the red-leaning state. “That state is competitive. It is a must-win for us,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). “We’re going to spend a lot of money pointing out the shortcomings of Ms. Ross, of which there are many, too numerous to mention for the rest of the [election]. And I know that some of our friends have stated publicly that they intend to do that.” Wicker himself refused to concede that Burr isn’t working hard enough. And worries about Burr in Washington strategy rooms is nothing new. His first Senate campaign in 2004 was characterized by his lone ranger style as he bombed around the state, often alone, to events, Republicans recounted. By 2010 he’d done little to elevate his stature, yet cruised to reelection as part of the tea party wave with the same relaxed demeanor. “This happens every six years,” remarked a fourth top GOP operative. This year, though, is different. The DSCC’s commitment is a major development in the race; Burr faced essentially no attacks from outside groups in 2010. And the presidential tossup in combination with Burr’s under-the-radar stature means he’s likely to lose his seat if Clinton bests Trump. Yet Burr is as carefree as ever, moseying through the Capitol halls alone, without aides or talking points to dispense. And since he’s not listening to campaign officials, Republicans have no other solution other than to trust that he knows what he’s doing. “That sometimes makes the experts uneasy,” said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.).",1,0,0
888,"Republican nominee Donald Trump’s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn’t exist until President Obama. “I don’t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this … Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and I think that’s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.” This perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy. Supporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.” To put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans “were raised.” In one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface. She is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “I don’t care, it’s the truth.” The Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen. UPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season. Watch it here – her remarks begin at 4:40: ",0,1,0
954,"Donald Trump on Monday morning claimed credit for accurately calling the weekend’s explosion in Manhattan a bombing, even before full details were in, as the Republican presidential nominee attempts to exploit the latest terror threats to boost his campaign. Trump slammed the media for attacking him over his early use of the bomb term and accused them of editing out clips of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton using a similar term. (CNN came under fire for using a clip of Hillary Clinton that axed her reference to the bombings, the first response from her gaggle with reporters Saturday.) Story Continued Below “If you saw her in the back of the plane — and she used the word ‘bombs’ also, by the way. I heard — I didn’t see it — but I heard I was criticized for calling it correctly,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in a telephone interview. “But what I said was exactly correct. I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news.” Trump claimed “everybody” has said that he was right but “called it too soon.” “OK, give me a break,” he continued. “But Hillary Clinton used the word ‘bombs’ shortly thereafter and nobody said anything about it. And somebody said some of them edit that word out. They took it out. Hey, folks, it’s a rigged system, and I’ve been saying it for a long time. And the news is as dishonest as anybody there is.” Trump told supporters at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Saturday night that “a bomb went off,” a remark that preceded public confirmation from local officials as they responded to an explosion that injured 29 people. “Just before I got off the plane, a bomb went off in New York, and nobody knows exactly what’s going on, but boy, we are living in a time,” he said Saturday. Clinton, however, did the same thing, all the while attacking her opponent for his untimely assessment. Speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane Saturday evening, Clinton said that she had been briefed “about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota.” Despite using a similar term as Trump, though, the former secretary of state dinged her rival just moments later. “I think it's important to know the facts about any incident like this,” she said. “I think it's always wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened.” The real estate mogul suggested the media were attacking him not because he cited the explosion as a bombing before it was confirmed but because polls are tightening. National polls released last week by Fox News and CBS News/New York Times show a tight race between both candidates in a head-to-head, with Trump leading by 1 percentage point in the Fox News poll but trailing by 2 percentage points in the CBS News/New York Times survey. “The reason is because my poll numbers now are so good that they’re so worried,” he said. Respondents to the Fox News poll narrowly favor Clinton as the candidate they think would perform better on the terrorism and national security front, 47 percent to 46 percent. Terrorism has punctuated the presidential campaign, with domestic and international attacks striking areas including San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; and Paris and Nice, France. The attacks, at times, have yielded very different responses from the candidates trying to convince Americans that they can best handle these threats as commander in chief. Clinton has tried to position herself as the steady hand America needs, while Trump has portrayed himself as a strong leader who will obliterate terror threats. Clinton’s responses to such incidents are usually much more cautious and measured than Trump’s, who is often criticized for his actions in the wake of terror attacks. Case in point: Following the domestic attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando, Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims that he has since modulated and triumphantly tweeted that he is appreciative of “the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism.” On Monday, he seemingly recommended profiling, arguing that law enforcement officials “know who a lot of these people are” but “don’t wanna be accused of profiling and they don’t wanna be accused of all sorts of things.” “We don’t wanna do any profiling,” Trump said. “If somebody looks like he’s got a massive bomb on his back, we won’t go up to that person and say, ‘I’m sorry,’ because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world, we’re not allowed to profile. Give me a break.”",1,0,0
1472,"Glen Campbell’s family released that he was in his final stages of Alzheimer’s and we were all extremely heartbroken to hear the news. When we found out that Glen Campbell was in his final stages of Alzheimer’s we weren’t sure what to expect the next couple of months. Unfortunately, this meant that Glen Campbell had lost all ability to speak or play guitar and it was just a matter of time before we had to say goodbye forever.  Campbell family has handled the situation very gracefully and they have been as strong as they possibly can be while they watch him wither away. His wife has become an advocate for Alzheimer’s and his children are also very involved. Glen Campbell made an exceptional impact on country music, and it has been absolutely heartbreaking to see him this way. Although he isn’t able to attend any shows, the country music world has surrounded him with love from afar.  Recently at the ACM Honors, four special country men took the stage to honor Glen Campbell and all that he has done for country music. Dierks Bentley, Blake Shelton, Toby Keith and Keith Urban gave one of the greatest tributes of all time and Glen Campbell’s daughter spoke to PEOPLE about the honor that it was. “The Academy of Country Music reached out to us a while ago and we were completely thrilled…I hope people see how his music and his voice really touched people and is still touching people now. It’s the definition of timeless.”  Her father is now 80-years-old and he is being cared for at a full-time care facility near their home in Nashville, Tennessee. Ashley says that her father’s disease is definitely progressing but that lately he has stayed pretty steady with little to no change. She went on to say that sometimes he will see her and light up with a smile, and he’ll hug her. Of course, with the disease progressing you never know what to expect when you walk in the doors where he is. “He’s definitely progressing but he’s been pretty steady lately…There’s no giant leaps and bounds, but for the most part he is just in his own world. When I go and visit him, he might notice I’m there and his face will light up and he’ll give me a hug.”  And although his attention span is really short right now, Ashley says that he finds joy in being around others which is a huge blessing for her and her family at this point in the disease. “(He’s) just very happy and content and a joy for everyone to be around…That’s all you can ask for at that stage.”  We are heartbroken to hear about Glen, but happy that he still loves to be around his family!

269,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's campaign on Tuesday stood by a controversial tweet issued by the candidate's son, Donald Trump Jr., in which he likened Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles. On Monday, Trump Jr. tweeted a graphic that likened Syrian refugees to Skittles, which swiftly triggered a wave of criticism. ""This image says it all. Let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put America first. #trump2016,"" he tweeted, with a graphic that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcast The graphic had an official Trump logo that the Republican nominee shares with his running mate, Mike Pence. Despite widespread condemnation, the campaign stood by the tweet and in a statement called Trump Jr. ""a tremendous asset to the campaign."" ""America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton's planned 550% increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk,"" said senior communication adviser Jason Miller. ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us."" Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, also defended the comparison to CNN's Erin Burnett. ""What we do know is that many Americans are concerned with the lack of vetting that's going on. We see what's happening all across Europe ... that has been a disaster,"" she said Tuesday on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" But Mars Candy, which produces Skittles, said in a statement, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy. We respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing."" 'This is disgusting' The graphic's language apparently wasn't a Trump Jr. original, but instead that of former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois and now a conservative talk radio host. Walsh tweeted at Trump Jr.: ""Hey @DonaldTrumpJr, that's the point I made last month. Glad you agree."" Walsh's tweet included a screenshot of a tweet he made dated August 13. Hillary Clinton's campaign spokesman Nick Merrill retweeted Trump Jr. adding: ""This is disgusting."" The 2016 campaign has featured heated rhetoric around US policy for accepting refugees. Clinton has called for an increase in the number of Syrian refugees the US should accept and Trump has called for ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants, as well as a ban on immigrants from countries that are hotbeds of terrorism, such as Syria. One of President Barack Obama's former speechwriters responded to Trump Jr. with a link to CNN reporting about a little boy in Aleppo, Syria, who became the face of the humanitarian crises in Syria. ""Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr, this is one of the millions of children you compared to a poisoned Skittle today,"" Jon Favreau tweeted. Former Obama campaign staffer, Jason Sparks, tweeted at Trump Jr. photos of the Syrian refugee children in the crises and said: ""These aren't Skittles, @DonaldJTrumpJr."" Musician John Legend, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump on Twitter, wrote: ""There's a tiny chance that anyone could be a murderer. Get rid of everyone now!!! #trumplogic"" Legend also retweeted a photo of the Aleppo boy, where someone said: ""This is not a skittle."" And former CIA director James Woolsey, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, told CNN's Kate Bolduan and John Berman during ""At This Hour"" that it was a ""clumsy analogy"" that ""doesn't help"" the Trump campaign. ""But he's not the one running for president,"" Woolsey added. Last week, Trump Jr. was criticized for making a ""gas chamber"" reference when complaining about how the treatment his father has received form the media compared to the coverage from Clinton. ""They've let her slide on every discrepancy, on every lie, on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the thing,"" he said. ""I mean, if Republicans were doing that, they'd be warming up the gas chamber right now. It's a very different system -- there's nothing fair about it."" This story has been updated. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story wrongly identified the state Joe Walsh represented in Congress and misattributed a quote to him. Walsh is a former Illinois congressman.

1055,"Even as Donald Trump and his allies ramped up their fundraising and political infrastructure in August, their combined monthly fundraising haul lagged $42 million behind that of Hillary Clinton’s forces, according to a POLITICO analysis of reports filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. The Trump campaign, two supportive super PACs and the Republican National Committee pulled in a combined $70 million, relying largely on small donors, during the tumultuous month of August, when his campaign shook up its leadership in an attempt to reboot after a chaotic nominating convention in July. Story Continued Below By contrast, the Clinton campaign, an allied super PAC and the Democratic National Committee, leaning heavily on major donors, raised a total of $112 million in August, as her campaign rode a strong bounce from its tightly choreographed, star-studded convention. Trump’s forces entered September with almost $96 million in the bank, while Clinton’s started the month with $121.4 million, according to Politico’s analysis. The analysis does not include fundraising tallies for the joint fundraising committees the rival candidates created with their respective parties, nor does it include the fundraising hauls from some supportive super PACs. All of those committees disclose their finances on a quarterly basis, meaning they won’t be required to file detailed financial reports until Oct. 15. But the analysis provides revealing hints about the contrasting strategies employed by the presidential candidates and their allies. The joint fundraising committee that Trump created with the RNC appears to be sitting on a significant sum of cash — perhaps as much as $47 million at the end of last month — while distributing only $12 million to the RNC itself and $20 million to Trump’s campaign. That transfer to Trump accounted for nearly half his August total — the first time he’s received such a large portion of his cash that way. Clinton, on the other hand, received $31.4 million from her own joint fundraising vehicle, and the Democratic National Committee received $12 million. An additional $12 million appear to have gone to state parties but been rerouted to the DNC, repeating a pattern from previous months. (The DNC also transferred out some $14 million to various state parties in August.) Trump’s campaign, which had largely eschewed spending on the trappings of political tactics, showed early signs of implementing a more conventional operation under its new leadership. It spent serious money — $5.3 million — on paid media in August, most of which went through Rick Reed Media, though $718,000 went through Jamestown Associates, the firm of his then-new senior communications adviser Jason Miller. That was dwarfed by the $32.7 million that Clinton paid her media buyer, GMMB, in August. Trump spent almost $1 million on field consultants, up from $432,000 in July. And his campaign’s staff grew to 140 people, with a total payroll of $643,000, up from $392,000 for 84 people in July. But that still trailed Clinton’s 789-person, $3.3 million payroll. Trump more than doubled his spending on field consulting in August to $973,000. The campaign also paid for polling, something it had been reluctant to do, directing $128,500 to the firm of Kellyanne Conway, who took over as campaign manager late in the month. And it spent $250,000 on data services provided by Cambridge Analytica, a firm owned largely by the influential Mercer family, which played a pivotal role in Trump’s campaign shakeup and is spearheading one of the super PACs backing the campaign. Still, the campaign continued devoting serious cash to bankroll the former reality TV star’s traveling show: $2 million went for rally-related expenses including facility rentals, audio-visual services, and event staging and consulting. Then, of course, there was the spending on Trump branding, which included $420,00 on hats and $1.7 million on T-shirts and other merchandise. And the campaign spent $547,000 on services provided by Trump’s own companies, including $170,000 for rent at Trump Tower and $319,000 on TAG Air Inc. By contrast, Trump spent only $80,000 on strategy consulting, with the firm of fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski receiving $20,000 of that. And the campaign’s largest expense continued to be online advertising and fundraising payments to the Austin-based digital firm of Trump’s digital director Brad Parscale, who is running the campaign’s online fundraising and advertising efforts, despite having no prior political experience. His firm reaped $11.1 million in August — up nearly $3 million from July and good for a third of all the campaign’s spending. Although the online fundraising effort overseen by Parscale helped produce an impressive small-dollar haul in which 65 percent of the campaign’s contributions came in amounts of less than $200, the payments to Giles-Parscale suggest the campaign has spent heavily on list rentals, email solicitations and online advertising to round up those small contributions. The percentage of cash that Clinton raised from small donors was half of Trump’s. About 31 percent of her cash came in checks of less than $200, which actually marked a slight improvement over her average across the cycle. Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine focused in August on big-dollar fundraisers in exclusive summer destinations. Likewise, the main super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, drew more than half of its $23.4 million August haul from its top five donors: Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner ($3 million each), billionaire financier George Soros ($2.5 million), investor Donald Sussman and Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective (both with $2 million). Trump received some good news this week about the fundraising of his own high-dollar super PACs. Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who had been sitting out the cycle so far, and his wife, Miriam, reportedly committed $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC effort, but the group to which he has pledged the cash hasn’t launched the effort and it won’t disclose its finances until next month. The other super PACs supporting Trump have continued to lag in fundraising. Make America Number 1, the pro-Trump super PAC run by the Mercer family, received $1 million from Cherna Moskowitz, a Miami philanthropist, and $50,000 from Erik Prince, who founded the defense contractor Blackwater. But it didn’t receive any other big checks and didn’t get a dime in August from the Mercer family, which had donated $2 million to the PAC in July. Another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America PAC, appears to have the campaign’s blessing after Eric Trump, the candidate’s son, attended one of its events. But it raised only $3.6 million in August, including $250,000 from RHS Investments, a Texas company that appears to be tied to banking executive Robert H. Seale, and $200,000 from Martin Harmon of Rocklin, Calif. The Committee to Restore America’s Greatness and Rebuilding America Now — other pro-Trump super PACs — won’t disclose their financials until next month because they report on a quarterly cycle. The same goes for pro-Clinton groups American Bridge and Correct the Record.",1,0,0

1041,"NEW YORK — John Kerry has been called an ""indefatigable optimist,"" the kind of guy determined to try, try again in spite of tough odds. It's a drive that helped him push through the Iran nuclear deal and keeps him searching for ways to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. But the latest chaos in Syria has critics saying he may be trying too hard this time — looking weak in the process and undermining his own goal of a peace deal. Story Continued Below A Syrian cease-fire that Kerry announced less than two weeks ago is near collapse. The first big blow came Saturday after an apparently errant U.S. airstrike believed to have killed dozens of Syrian government soldiers instead of Islamic State terrorists not party to the truce. Then, on Monday, suspected Syrian government airstrikes hit an aid convoy, killing at least 12 people and infuriating moderate rebels already wary of making a deal with Syrian President Bashar Assad. And late on Tuesday, a report emerged that U.S. intelligence indicates that Russian forces actually carried out the strike. By any measure, the developments are a blow to the 72-year-old secretary of state. Still, on Tuesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Kerry met yet again with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Syria's de facto international representative, to see what could be done to salvage the cease-fire. ""He seems unaware that it's simply impossible to win at the negotiating table what you do not win on the ground, and he seems to be unaware that he keeps getting outsmarted and outmaneuvered by Lavrov,"" Elliott Abrams, a former deputy national security adviser in Republican George W. Bush's administration, wrote in an e-mail to POLITICO. ""His defenders say well, better to try than to give up, but that is wrong. He looks weak, and that makes the United States look weak."" The argument to keep trying is compelling. An estimated half-million people have died in the Syrian civil war since March 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes. Syria's misery is likely to be the biggest stain on Kerry's legacy as secretary of state, not to mention Barack Obama's legacy as president. Kerry's defenders grouse that he is being unfairly criticized by detractors who fail to offer reasonable alternatives — scenarios that won't slip the U.S. into another war in the Middle East. And the secretary of state himself, wherever he goes, insists that the problem in Syria must ultimately be solved through a political, not military solution. ""What he's trying to do on Syria isn't about his legacy — he doesn't view it in those terms,"" a State Department official told POLITICO. ""Critics can claim all they want that he is being unrealistic, but they aren’t sitting in the room like the rest of us watching him work tirelessly to try to find a way through, leveraging every ounce of personal relationships he has to reach [an] accord. Never once have I heard him talk blindly about trust. It’s always been a sober assessment of the interests at stake and an honest effort to negotiate. The man knows people, and he knows how far he can take things."" Added a former administration official of Kerry: ""I just don't think he gives two thoughts to whether some wise guy in Washington believes he shouldn't have tried. He would want to hear their alternative."" But the Russians, and for that matter the Syrians, have little incentive to acquiesce to an administration that's on its way out; and Moscow appears either unwilling or unable to rein in Assad. The Syrian dictator, bent on staying in power, appears impervious to criticism from enemies and pleas from allies. Robert Ford, a former Obama administration ambassador to Syria, said Kerry's tactics, not his intent, pose a risk. ""I’m full of admiration for him for being willing to try. He’s not afraid to grapple with big issues, and I think he deserves some credit for that,"" said Ford, now at the Middle East Institute. ""What’s not clear is whether his constantly going back to the Russians over and over again is helping or hurting his efforts to convince them. It's making him look weak. I don’t know that the Russians do things out of kindness or if instead they take advantage of weak players and weak countries."" Part of the problem for Kerry, observers say, is that Obama appears to have zero interest in committing more military muscle to give his secretary of state leverage in the talks with Russia. ""Time will prove that Kerry played a weak hand as good as he could,"" said Randa Slim, an analyst also with the Middle East Institute. ""The blame for U.S. inaction in Syria and its consequences should rest on Obama's shoulders, not Kerry's."" It also doesn't help that there are divisions within the Obama administration over what to do about Syria. More than 50 U.S. officials signed a memo leaked earlier this year that urges U.S. airstrikes on the Assad regime. Kerry himself is reported to have asked Obama to allow airstrikes on specific Syrian government targets to put Assad on notice, but Obama, wary of deepening the U.S. military role in the conflict, has declined. The recent bargain Kerry struck with Russia on Syria also has upset the Pentagon because it included coordination between Moscow and Washington on airstrikes against terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. Defense officials are extremely wary of sharing intelligence with Russia. Kerry's defenders insist he is not naive, despite his professed faith in the power of negotiations. For instance, at least twice during the marathon talks that led to the nuclear deal with Iran last year, Kerry reportedly became fed up with Iranian intransigence and threatened to quit the negotiations. In fact, Kerry's determination to get a deal with Tehran fueled similar questions last year about whether he was too eager for a legacy-making accomplishment. Kerry has spent most of his life in public service, but he's been dogged by criticism that he passed too few notable bills during his years as a lawmaker. He also failed to defeat Bush in the 2004 race for the White House. Another challenge Kerry has tried to solve repeatedly is the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. After taking over as secretary of state in 2013, Kerry pushed the two sides to try once again to come to terms. But ultimately that effort sputtered. The Syria crisis is in many ways more complex than the decades old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Not only is the carnage ongoing and on an extraordinary scale, the sheer number of Syrian groups involved and international actors taking sides makes three-dimensional chess look easy. The cease-fire currently on the brink in Syria isn't even the first one Kerry has helped devise. A truce reached in February kept hold for several weeks before eventually collapsing. Then, too, Kerry worked long hours to negotiate with the Russians to agree to the cease-fire. That was alongside on and off initiatives to bring Syrian rebel leaders and Assad's representatives to the bargaining table for a long-term deal. On Monday, following the airstrike on the U.N. aid convoy, senior administration officials briefing reporters had tough words for Russia, saying it was responsible for the Syrian government's actions. ""The Russians have the responsibility certainly to restrain — refrain from taking such action themselves, but they also have the responsibility to keep the regime from doing it,"" one official said. ""The burden is on the Russians to demonstrate ... quickly and in a significant way, that they are committed to this process, which — without which obviously we’re not going to be able to move forward with them."" The administration's tone was more restrained following Tuesday's meeting between Lavrov, Kerry, and others involved in the Syrian peace effort. A readout from the State Department said participants decided they needed to meet again, but agreed that despite the violence, ""there was still an imperative to pursue a nationwide cessation of hostilities."" The shorter version? John Kerry is going to keep trying.",1,0,0
800,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference, “If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.” These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said, “If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.” She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader. The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance. Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want. However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that. Merkel stated, “If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.” Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said, “It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.” The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her. ",0,0,1
377,"(CNN)Donald Trump reacted to the turmoil in Charlotte this week by lamenting ""a lack of spirit between the white and the black,"" adding that ""it's very divided, our country, and it's getting worse, so I'm not overly surprised to see it."" In an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning, Trump pointed to the violent protests over the fatal police shooting of an African-American man in Charlotte as an example of frayed relationships between law enforcement and minority communities across the country. ""It just seems that there's a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it's a terrible thing that we're witnessing,"" he said. ""You are seeing it, I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte, a great place, and you just see it. There's somewhat -- and I see it even going out. There's such a lack of spirit. There's a lack of something, something that's going on that's bad, and what's going on between police and others is getting worse."" Trump had also discussed the tension between police and the communities they serve in a pre-taped town hall that was set to air on Fox News Wednesday night, but which was preempted by coverage of the Charlotte protests. During the town hall, Trump proposed expanding the use of the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program by police. ""I think you have to,"" the Republican nominee said at the town hall. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" Trump elaborated on his call for ""stop-and-frisk"" in the interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning, saying he was only referring to expanding its use to Chicago, where he said gun violence was particularly severe. ""(Former NYPD Commissioner) Ray Kelly did a great job, and New York was not in a Chicago situation, but it was really in trouble,"" Trump said. ""But stop-and-frisk worked. We had tremendous shootings, numbers of shootings. Now Chicago is out of control. I was really referring to Chicago stop-and-frisk. They asked me about Chicago."" Under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and then search them on the spot for guns and drugs, among other things. New York City's stop-and-frisk program was mired in controversy, leading to numerous complaints that the practice led to racial profiling. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the program was unconstitutional because it unlawfully targeted blacks and Latinos, although stop and frisk was not banned. Trump also expressed doubts about the ability of cities like Charlotte to build trust in divided communities. ""If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue,"" Trump said, referencing the murder of five Dallas police officers by a sniper over the summer after videos showing two African-American men shot by police in Louisiana and Minnesota spurred protests and debate over police use of force across the country. ""They prided themselves on dialogue, and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups. And that was a pretty tough situation, to put it mildly."" ",1,0,0
326,"(CNN)A group of 375 ""concerned"" scientists -- including famed physicist Stephen Hawking -- released an open letter Tuesday sharply criticizing Donald Trump, citing the threat of climate change and blasting his push for the US to leave the Paris Accord. ""It is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. A 'Parexit' would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: 'The United States does not care about the global problems of human-caused climate change. You are on your own,'"" the group wrote on the website responsiblescientists.org. The use of the term ""Parexit"" is a reference to a political withdrawal along the lines of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, commonly called the ""Brexit."" They continued, ""The consequences of opting out of the global community would be severe and long-lasting -- for our planet's climate and for the international credibility of the United States."" The letter is signed by a number of famous scientists, including Hawking and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, who served as Secretary of Energy under President Barack Obama. CNN reached out to the Trump campaign for a response to the letter, but did not immediately receive a response. The Paris Agreement was reached by 195 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, aimed at coordinating global efforts to combat climate change. Obama was a main proponent of the agreement, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supports its ongoing implementation. The group slammed politicians who deny the existence of man-made climate change. ""During the presidential primary campaign, claims were made that the Earth is not warming, or that warming is due to purely natural causes outside human control. Such claims are inconsistent with reality,"" they wrote. Republican nominee Donald Trump opposes the agreement, and he has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax ""created by and for the Chinese."" He recently said in an interview that ""I am not a great believer in man-made climate change."" ",1,0,0
868,"A new investigation has determined that Donald Trump’s charitable foundation funneled other people’s money into settling his lawsuits, which violates laws preventing charitable organizations from accepting donors funds and benefitting those who run the foundations. With a stroke of the pen Trump pilfered the average wage of five working Americans to payoff his business fines: Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump’s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “self-dealing” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses. The Washington Post‘s David Farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the Donald J. Trump Foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook (they’ve shown photos of it) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing: a complete fact check of Donald Trump’s dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption. It was Farenthold’s investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in Florida to call for a federal investigation into the Trump University pay-for-play scandal where the very same foundation Trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Now his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $120,000 fine for Mar-a-lago, Trump’s glitzy party palace in Palm Beach and the nation’s largest private home. Trump was supposed to donate money to a veteran’s foundation, instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead. Ironically, it was all because of the size of a flagpole: In one case, from 2007, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole. In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines — if Trump’s club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people’s money, according to tax records. This wasn’t just charity for the wealthy; it was a direct subsidy to one of the Trump Organization’s most prized businesses. But it wouldn’t be the only six figure heist engineered by Donald Trump with little more than the stroke of a pen. When you watch Donald Trump pitch his golf course in Scotland on a campaign trip, just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the Republican nominee in court. WaPo reports that: One of Trump’s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff’s chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records. On top of that, Trump also used his charitable foundation’s funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $12,000 Tim Tebow football helmet. The latest find by Farenthold uncovered that he spent another $10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels. We hear that the latest of Trump’s charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller. The New York Attorney General has already opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation for its illegal transaction with Florida’s Attorney General, and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the Republican’s nominee for President which we know all too well by now. Donald Trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal, as long as he can get away with it. Here’s the check proving that Trump stole from his donors to pay for Mar-a-lago’s debts: ",0,1,0
387,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump was asked by a member of a Fox News town hall audience this week what he would do to reduce violent crime in the country's inner cities. ""Right, well, one of the things I'd do, Ricardo, is I would do 'stop-and-frisk.' I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically. You understand; you have to, in my opinion. I see what's going on here. I see what's going on in Chicago; I think stop-and-frisk, in New York City, it was so incredible, the way it worked."" Stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found. It grew out of the tough policies of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a vocal Trump supporter and trusted adviser, under the theory that aggressive enforcement of even minor laws would lead to a reduction of violent crime. Proponents of stop-and-frisk argue that it would be especially effective in getting illegal guns off the streets. Critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. They also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and Latino men. But is Trump right that stop-and-frisk ""worked incredibly well?"" It is clear that crime rates plunged in New York during Giuliani's time in office, as well as the terms of his successor, Michael Bloomberg, who ramped up the stop-and-frisk program. What's less clear is the policy's impact on the lower crime rate. The number of stops in the city rose dramatically from 97,296 in 2002 to 685,724 in 2011, a seven-fold increase, according to data compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union based on police reports. But the number of homicides did not fall in proportion to the soaring number of stops, dropping from 587 in 2002 to 515 in 2011. Moreover, the NYCLU also found that in the more than 5 million stops between 2002 and 2013, guns were found in only 0.2% of the cases. Other violent crimes also fell during this time period. Assaults were down 13%, robberies declined 27% and rape declined 35%, according to City-Data.com. But none of these drops came close to corresponding with the huge increase in stop-and-frisk cases. New York's stop-and-frisk policy was found to be unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 and current Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed to end it in 2014. The newly elected mayor dropped the city's appeal of that decision. That decision elicited cries from some proponents that it would lead to a surge in violent crime. However, except for an uptick in 2015, the city's homicide rate continued its downward trend, reaching historic lows in the first quarter of 2016. ",1,0,0

578,"The government’s answer to every failed program or ineffective federal department is to dump more taxpayer money in it. Ever since government education has become the norm, kids are dumb and dumber. But big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just don’t have enough money. So, they throw more money at it, and the problems only get bigger. Ever since the War on Drugs was declared, we’ve spent over $1.5 trillion, and drug use remains unchanged or even worse. But instead of questioning the policy or considering the Constitutionality of the issue, their answer is to throw more money at it, in hopes that they’ll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all. But it only gets worse. The same is true with the “War on Terror.” The U.S. government dumped $5 trillion into it, terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds. But instead of reevaluating our foreign policy – especially pertaining to the Middle East – the politicians’ answer is to expand our foreign policy, and of course, throw more money at it. And terrorism continues to grow. From Zero Hedge: According to a report released by Dr. Neta Crawford, professor of political science at Brown University, spending by the United States Departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Veteran Affairs since 9/11 is now close to $5 trillion USD. Before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $19.3 trillion USD in debt can spend $5 trillion USD on war, the focus of this article is to ask: What has all of this spending achieved? As Reader Supported News reported at the end of last year, terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 (they probably should rename it “the war of terror”). In 2014, the outlet noted, it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Syria. As stated by Paul Gottinger, a staff reporter for Reader Supported News, out of the aforementioned countries, “only Nigeria did not experience either U.S. air strikes or a military occupation in that year.” Omitted from that assessment is the fact that the U.S. has been meddling in Nigeria for some time now. Why wouldn’t they? Until recently, Nigeria was Africa’s largest oil producer, as well as the continent’s largest economy until last month. And look at this shocker from Ben Swann: “Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq? None. In the country’s history there had never been one. But since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892. “In Iraq, prior to the start of the Iraq war, there were reportedly just over 1.5 million Christians living in that country. And yet shortly after the war started, more than one million of them fled to Syria. That didn’t work out well. Today fewer than half a million Christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like ISIS.” The more terrorism grows and is a threat to our national security, the more laws the U.S. government passes that not only continually erode away at our freedoms, but do nothing to protect us.

The purpose of journalism is to inform you of events.  You are then free to decide your opinion of those events.  Opinions expressed in the media are supposed to be from either the public or the editors.  But that is not what the leftist media practices today.  Remember the 2nd Romney-Obama debate?  The moderator took over debating Romney and backed Obama’s lie that he said the assassination of Ambassador Stevens was a terror attack.  Even though she admitted she lied the next day the damage was done. I am not a journalist.  I have a degree in journalism, but that doesn’t make me a journalist.  I do not work for the media and I do not report the news.  I am a blogger.  I do not report events.  I express my opinion of events.  Before you read my articles I expect you to already know the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of events.  If you are ignorant because you listen to the leftwingnut media spin then you will probably think my opinion is wrong because you think my facts are lies.  There are leftwingnuts who have chastised bloggers as false because we express our opinions, as if by doing so that makes what we say not the truth.  Expressing your opinion of an event does not make the facts of that event a lie – except in the narrow minds of ignorant liberals. I have also been chastised that I do not make good arguments because I am not politically correct and considerate of people’s feelings.  I’m from the Forrest Gump/Larry the Cable Guy school of education and believe that “Stupid is as stupid does” and “You can’t fix stupid.”  Intelligent people will learn from what I write and if they are ignorant of the facts I present they will take the time to learn.  The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that ignorance is a lack of knowledge that can be amended through education.  Stupidity is an inability to learn, whether accidentally or purposely, and cannot be cured, but must be defeated.  The reason we have Obama is because stupid people believed what he said rather than examined his background and elected him on the basis of lies. Back in the eighties, I stopped watching television news when I realized all of it was biased anti-Reagan BS.  Reagan undid the Fairness Doctrine that Democrats had inflicted on media back under Truman so that they could control the media’s content.  With that boot lifted of the throats of conservatives there arose the rightwing media led by Rush Limbaugh and FOX News.  Rush has been a godsend expressing the opinions of the Silent Majority that had not permitted to speak over the airwaves.  Add to that a network that not only reported events, but had both sides express their opinions and the Moral Majority not only had a voice once again, but was able to debate with liberals openly so that both sides could be heard together!  That’s why leftists want to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine to shut us down and silence us again.  It’s not about making the Internet fair, it’s about censoring what is right and true. This is the dirty little secret that the Left doesn’t want people to know, which is why they say FOX News lies about everything.  Whenever someone actually watches FOX and the Democrat media side-by-side they discover that the Left is a pack of looney lies and they can get far more of the truth and good sense from FOX.  Even listening to liberals on FOX trying to twist the truth in their arguments with conservatives reveals their ideology to be based on deception. But Trump’s relentlessness has forced the Left to come out from under their cover as supposed journalists and reveal themselves to be nothing more than Democrat propagandists.  The result is that the people no longer trust the media.

1499,"A mother is outraged after council chiefs removed her deceased son’s star-shaped headstone following a complaint from another family who claimed it wasn’t “in keeping” with the rest of the cemetery. Max Corbett-Gardener was just 4 years old when he passed away after complications from his severe epilepsy. His mother, Jo Corbett-Weeks, 42, saved up $4,580 to design a specially-made headstone featuring a teddy bear holding a star inscribed with a tribute to her son, the Daily Mail reports.  The heartfelt memorial was erected on Max’s grave to commemorate what would have been the boy’s seventh birthday. But three days later, the headstone was removed from Great Malvern Cemetery by council chiefs in Worcestershire. “It would have been Max's seventh birthday on the Sunday, and this was like a birthday present to him from me,” Corbett-Weeks, who has two other children ages 16 and 5, told BBC. “I chose a star-shaped stone because I wanted something suitable for Max - something personal. “This stone is just so perfect for my poor little chap,"" she added.  A family had complained to the Malvern Town Council that the headstone was not “in keeping” with the rest of the cemetery. Corbett-Weeks says the stone was then removed without her knowledge or consent and she is demanding that it be reinstated. “I was totally unaware this was going on. The council did not contact me and it was the stonemason who told me he'd been ordered to remove it,” Corbett-Weeks explained. “I feel upset, distressed and angry. We have been through so much as a family. I could understand if the grave was uncared for or unsightly, but it isn't. “The headstone meant a lot to me and the family but now we are fighting to have it put back,"" she said. ""It's a horrible situation. We just want to have somewhere to grieve.” The memorial was placed in the adult area of the cemetery, where Corbett-Weeks had her son buried so that he could be close to other family members.  The council said that if the application for the stone had been received within the usual time frame, they would not have given the stonemason permission to install it in the first place. They added that had the star-shaped headstone been installed at the children’s area of the cemetery, it would have been allowed. “We have a conformity of shapes in our lawn cemetery. We were contacted by people who objected to the shape,” a Malvern Town Council spokesman explained to BBC. “The longer it stayed up, the harder the process would have been. “It was a very difficult decision to remove it but one we had to make straight away,"" the spokesman said. The council added that the complaint was not so much about the shape of the headstone as it was about following protocol. 'It wasn't necessarily an objection to the shape but why we appeared to be applying one rule to one family and other rules to another,” the spokesman continued. “The stonemason in this situation did not have permission to put the stone up - and the stone is not in keeping with the graves in that area. “By not following the correct process he has caused considerable distress to both families,"" the spokesman concluded. The council is arranging a meeting with Corbett-Weeks to discuss a new design for her son’s headstone. Sources: Daily Mail, BBC Photo Credit: BBC, worcestershirenews.co.uk",0,0,1

Me personally, I’d boycott them and I’m this close to boycotting the entire NFL even though there are some good guys in it. Four Philadelphia Eagles players raised the Black Power fist at their game during the National Anthem. I’ve had it with this crap. I’ve seen other players do this as well. Hell, I’ve seen the Obamas do it too. It is totally unacceptable… it is a radical, racist gesture and should not be tolerated. No more than a Nazi salute would be tolerated. Did you know that Sports Illustrated just went all-in with the Black Lives Matter inspired anti-cop/anti-white NFL black protests, allocating the back-page essay to Jacksonville Jaguars player Jared Odrick? Yep, cross them off as well.  From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world. Last week NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now they’re raising the Black Power fist.

The only thing that saved her was her bullet proof vest. He went on to shoot a security guard and then take a human shield. He shot that woman in the leg as well. Then he dumped 14 rounds into a car with two people in it. He killed the woman and critically wounded the man. Then he shot another officer who obligingly sent him straight to hell where he belongs. Then these football players pushed racial hate at an Eagles game in essence celebrating that. These are wealthy anti-American bigots and I think the fans have had just about enough of this. We love America, our military and our police. This nation was well on her way to being colorblind until Obama took over. Now, we are at each other’s throats and a race war is looming. These whiny rich football players, who have been free to play their sport and get wealthy off it, hate the country and the fans who empowered them to live a privileged life.

110,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed: Hereâs Google:  Naturally, my reaction was âoh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wifeâs campaign now?â Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people donât do, to find out the real story â and the real story is that there is no pay to play. âIt was natural for people whoâve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldnât do anything they shouldnât do,â Clinton toldÂ NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning.Â  Source: CNN In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnât mean theyâll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but thereâs no evidence they got them. Now, letâs talk about the foundation the media doesnât like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasnât given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trumpâs charitable foundation over concerns that it âengaged in some improprietyâ as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled othersâ contributions âto make them appear to have come from himâ although he âhasnât given to the foundation since 2008.â Source: Media Matters Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clintonâs candidacy: Journalists have been criticized for the âdouble standardâ in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clintonâs pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Postâs reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trumpâs Dr. Oz stunt. All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton âscandalâ (if you call getting sick a âscandalâ) while ignoring every scandal in Trumpâs closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

596,"The nation’s top immigration officer said that the “11 million” undocumented aliens in the United States are “not going away,” are “in effect” citizens, and added that deporting the few the administration wants out is unpleasant: THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TREASON! SKIP TO THE 25:00 MARK FOR HIS COMMENTS ON ILLEGALS: Well, he just made 858 illegals from “hotbed” terror countries American citizens!  Hundreds of illegal immigrants from terrorist hotbeds who were supposed to have been deported were instead granted citizenship because Homeland Security didn’t have fingerprints on file to check their identity, the department’s inspector general said in a stunning new report Monday. At least two of those approved are now being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, investigators said. But in most cases, Homeland Security and federal prosecutors have let the illegal immigrants-turned-citizens get away with their potential fraud. Charges were brought in just two of the more than 800 cases identified. One of the persons granted citizenship through the error-riddled process is now a law enforcement officer, and three others worked in security-sensitive fields — including two who worked in sensitive areas at airports. “USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository,” the inspector general said. The 858 cases involved people from so-called “special interest” countries, or from neighboring countries with major immigration fraud problems. Special interest countries are those places the government has identified as posing national security problems to the U.S. WHAT’S EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE: Investigators late last year identified another 953 cases that also seemed suspicious. The problem, according to the audit, is tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and criminal aliens whose files are so old that their fingerprints are still on paper cards. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that approves applications, wasn’t checking those paper-based files, so it didn’t know the aliens were ineligible or had been ordered kicked out of the country already. The inspector general said some fingerprints have been digitized, but it identified 148,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but whose fingerprints are not in the IDENT system the department uses for its fingerprint checks.

853,"The so called “small government” Republicans running the state of Michigan are so fond of letting communities run their own affairs that they’ve blocked the city of Flint from being able to sue the state after the Governor’s specially-appointed “emergency manager” made a series of decisions that led to the mass poisoning of thousands with lead-tainted water. Just days after Flint’s Mayor Karen Weaver indicated that her town might sue the state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and his appointed five-man Receivership Transition Advisory Board changed the rules, preventing the city from suing without approval from the Advisory Board. House Speaker Kevin Cotter (R-Mt. Pleasant) complained that “a reckless lawsuit could throw the state budget into disarray and undermine everything we’ve done for the city.” They’ve done quite enough to make the lives of Flint citizens worse already. Gov. Snyder’s senseless Tea Party tax cuts blew gigantic holes in the state budget, prompting him to appoint emergency “managers” to rule bankrupt cities without any oversight from local governments. Those managers then arranged the switch from the Detroit water system to the heavily polluted Flint River water, ostensibly to “save money” but accusations of orchestrating a conspiracy to privatize the water company make the situation even murkier. Released emails showed that the Governor’s office ignored and dismissed complaints from the concerned consumers, all the while charging them the most expensive water prices in the country and hiding the fact that their water was tainted with lead and other dangerous toxins for nearly a year after the administration had learned of the contamination. Now, the so-called “small government” conservatives are blocking the city from seeking justice in the gross mismanagement and mass poisoning of its citizens. It’s a hypocrisy that has played out time and time again in red Midwestern states; Republican politicians scream and howl about the tyranny of the Obama administration but then decide to, say, ban cities in Oklahoma from banning fracking, where the land has become so unstable from fracking operations that earthquakes are now a weekly occurrence. It’s just another piece of evidence which shows that Republicans only exist to serve their corporate masters; they don’t even pretend to respect the opinions and rights of the people they supposedly represent.",0,1,0
845,"CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things. Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.  Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off. 521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her. Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won. With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and see. ",0,0,1
162,"While Donald Trump Jr., Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, compares refugees to poisoned skittles, the CEOs, Presidents and other executives of 51 companies are coming together to pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to aid refugees all across the world, the White House has announced. Coming together to show solidarity and compassion while world leaders meet for the U.N. General Assembly session, the companies â which include Matercard, Facebook, Twitter, Johnson & Johnson, and yogurt maker Chobani â will use the money to promote, sustain and continue education, employment and financial services all across the world, and alleviate suffering to over 6 million refugees: Today, 51 U.S. companies â whichÂ representÂ more than 2.5 million employees, more than $775 billion in annual revenue, and more than $3.2 trillion in market capitalization âÂ have stepped up andÂ are standing with the Administration to demonstrate that private sector innovation and resources can make a difference andÂ catalyze real solutions. Together,Â they have committed toÂ investing, donating, andÂ raising more than $650 million. The hefty pledge is just part of the White Houseâs goal of $3 billion in humanitarian aid, and the announcement was made just as President Obama hosted a refugee summitÂ with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, countries that have taken in thousands of refugees from Syria and other war-torn states. While meeting with the company CEOs and George Clooney, President Obama thanked them for their âextraordinary gesture of compassion,â saying: âI want to emphasize that from their perspective this isnât charity. This is part of their overall mission. It makes good business sense.â Unlike Trumpâs businesses â in which hotel stays have plummeted â people like to be compassionate, see compassion, and act on it. U.N.

929,"Donald Trump, the supposed “law and order” candidate, painted a very bleak picture of what life in the “inner cities” was like. “We have a situation where we have inner cities, African-Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous” said the Republican nominee a few hours earlier. He cited former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s unconstitutional and discriminatory “stop-and-frisk” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers. But his account didn’t match up with the facts, and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the NYPD isn’t good at their jobs. The Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information of the NYPD, J. Peter Donald, fact-checked Trump during the debate, and has this to say about the racist Republican’s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by Mayor Bloomberg in 2011:   Trump is trying to position himself as “tough on crime” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers. Not only was “stop-and-frisk” ineffective, it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended, crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques. Trump is trying to sell the American people an apocalyptic vision of America that just doesn’t exist – and the policemen whose support he’s courting aren’t buying it either.  ",0,1,0
1038,"The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan advocacy group that supports open government and tracks money in politics, announced Tuesday that it was cutting staff and suspending its data-driven projects and reporting tools. The organization, which launched in 2006 with the express purpose of tracking money in politics, said that it would end its tool building and database maintenance, which are often used by reporters writing about campaign finance and politics. Michael Klein, the Sunlight Foundation’s board chairman, wrote in a post Tuesday explaining the decision to scale back dramatically. “While we are enormously proud of what Sunlight has accomplished over the past decade, and has come to stand for, we are also aware of the changes time has wrought,” Klein wrote in the post. “We are aware that the robust maturation of technology over the past decade has — happily but substantially — reduced the urgency of Sunlight’s early role as a leading transparency innovator. In addition, the board had to recognize that Sunlight’s initiating objective— to build support for better legislation against and regulation of the power of money in politics— has been significantly limited by the US Supreme Court’s 5-4 Citizens United decision.” It’s unclear the number of people who were laid off from Sunlight Foundation Tuesday, or who could be laid off in the future. The organization as of Tuesday morning employed around 25 people. Several staffers were informed today that their positions had been eliminated, but management is still in the process of informing others. At least one staff writer, Libby Watson, announced on Twitter that she had been laid off. A spokesperson for Sunlight Foundation said that financial challenges played a role in the cuts and suspension of its tools. Sunlight Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is funded through donations. “It became increasingly harder to fund and maintain all of these different things,” the spokesperson said, referring to the various tools Sunlight Foundation has built over the years, tracking everything from deleted tweets of politicians to political fundraising. Another factor was the organization’s inability to find a permanent executive director with a vision for the organization’s future, Klein wrote. Sunlight Foundation co-founder, Ellen Miller, stepped down from her role as executive director in 2014, and the organization struggled to retain upper management since then. “The board has not found a candidate for executive director who persuaded us of both a compelling new strategic vision and of their capacity to lead Sunlight to its achievement,” Klein wrote. “Accordingly, we have determined to explore alliances with other organizations similarly motivated, perhaps merging with one of them, in an arrangement that advances and preserves Sunlight’s mission and identity with increased efficiency and effectiveness.” The hope is that Sunlight Foundation’s work can live on and be built upon at likeminded organizations devoted to government transparency and campaign finance. Those possible partnerships – or a potential merger with another organization, which Klein said the organization was exploring — will play a role in the fate of the employees at the nonprofit. Those potential partnerships are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. For the time being, Sunlight Foundation hopes to continue scaled-back operations for as long as possible.",1,0,0

Yet liberals were attacking Trump for describing the attack as a bombing. We’ve seen this kind of dishonesty from the liberal media before. Remember the Orlando nightclub shooting?

There’s no way that we can effectively fight Islamic terrorism if we can’t even acknowledge what it is. Donald Trump, for all his faults, is at the very least willing to call a spade a spade.

881,"It is an inarguable fact that law enforcement in the United States kill far too many citizens. Police officers in the United States have killed 706 people in summary executions without due process of the law; well on target to pass last year’s grisly total of 990. Our police officers shoot and kill people at a rate seventy times that of other developed countries, and that is absolutely unacceptable. The United Kingdom had 55 fatal police shootings in the past 24 years; American police murdered that many citizens in the first 24 days of 2015. The appalling frequency of unarmed black men being gunned down by overzealous police officers who don’t even bother to attempt to take them in peacefully prompts even more questions. Why are our cops so trigger-happy? One veteran thinks it may have something to do with their training.  The frequency of violence by American police officers can be partially blamed with the outrageous proliferation of firearms among a irresponsible civilian population leading to more cops being killed in the line of duty, as Republican nominee Donald Trump loves to spout – when he’s not busy telling you how Hillary Clinton is coming for your guns. But the number of deaths in the line of duty for police officers is down 17% since President Obama took office, hovering around 60 a year. Police departments cultivate this “shoot first and ask questions later” policy and have developed a wide array of tools to insulate themselves from facing consequences for their crimes. They do this to cover up the fact that the reality is that our police forces receive astonishingly poor training – less than is required to become a cosmetologist. A cosmetologist in Alabama requires 50 weeks of training. A soldier in Alabama completes ten weeks of basic training and then fifty-two weeks of advanced specialization training. A police officer in Alabama requires twelve weeks of training. On the other hand, a police officer in Norway requires two years of training. See the difference?",0,1,0

A federal judge just ruled that her e-mails won’t be released to the public until after election day. The FBI recovered a number of e-mails during their investigation into her server scandal, but the majority of them will remain secret for the time being. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is pointing the finger squarely at the Obama administration, blaming them for the delay in releasing the content of the e-mails. “This is an absolutely corrupt process the State Department has come up with,” he said. So, what is in these e-mails that is making so many people in the Obama administration work so hard to keep them hidden? She must have some pretty scandalous and controversial stuff in there that could ruin her chances of winning. And Obama has already declared Hillary as his successor, so he is clearly not going to let her campaign go down in flames.   Hillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians in existence. Most people know that already. But what is so worrying here is that she is evidently able to control both the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep herself out of jail, along with God knows how many federal judges. At this point, why even bother pretending that she’s held to the same laws as the rest of us puny citizens? And as if this all wasn’t bad enough, there are people who want to vote for her… so that she can become president and have even more power and influence than she already does. How crooked and criminal does Hillary need to be before these people wake up and realize what a catastrophe she is?   ",0,0,1
122,"The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops âare just obeying orders,â and the dead in the mass grave are âcitizens obeying gun laws.â This is the meme:  We donât know who created this, but we donât have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaust wouldnât have happened. The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decided werenât suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way â they are part of the Holocaust. The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actually didnât make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe. Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to. Why didnât those people, who own guns, rise up? Itâs because of the power of a police state â the very thing the âmoar gunzâ crowd fears the most. Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all. Hereâs why: âThis historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians haveÂ previously noted, a distortion of history itselfâ¦ â¦When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop.â Thatâs from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against Ben Carsonâs painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, but itâs just not true. And itâs an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them. This memeâs creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out. ",0,1,0

8,"ABC News is bringing its original livestream series ‘Strait Talk with Matt & LZ’ to the University of Detroit Mercy in front of a live audience on Monday, Sept. 19 at 7 p.m. ET for an open discussion about the biggest issues facing America this election cycle. ABC News Political Contributors Matthew Dowd and LZ Granderson, both Detroit natives, will be joined by Digital Host Amna Nawaz and ABC News Chief Political Correspondent Jonathan Karl as they talk with business leaders and community activists from the Motor City on key issues ranging from politics, race relations and law enforcement to religion and the economy. Dowd and Granderson opened up about the excitement behind bringing the show back to their hometown and why this conversation is needed right now.  ""Then there are the topics that are important but not needle movers -- like gentrification. From New York to Los Angeles, the poor are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes as developers reshape neighborhoods. Nestled in the shadows of the 'Detroit's recovery' narrative is the question of 'What will Detroit look like when it's over?' Take a look at Harlem: beautiful, yet void of the people and the history that made it an essential piece of Americana. Detroit is progressing toward that same fate and yet it cannot stay where it was. Solving this riddle is as important as creating jobs, whether it is on the news or not.” Dowd: “It's our birthplace and what formed us to a large degree as we went into our respective professions. Detroit really is the story of America. From modest beginnings on the frontier, to terrific economic growth from industrial revolution through mass production. Headquarters of the automobile, which symbolizes the freedom American's love. And the building of the middle class which really forms America in its unique position. And through the fall of Detroit because of loss of manufacturing, broken political governmental and corporate institutions. And now, rebuilding Detroit in whole new ways is taking place across America through entrepreneurs and innovation.”  ""We are at a point of incredible disruption in all our institutions. And there is fear that our democracy might be broken and we can't do the things that need to be done. With two major party leaders distrusted and disliked by a majority of the country, and Americans facing this choice in a few weeks.” Granderson: “Politically Michigan is an important state and Detroit an important city because it really does capture the rural versus urban vote that can be found in numerous states. There is Miami and then there is Florida. There is Chicago and then Illinois. There is Detroit, then there are huge chunks of the state that couldn't be more different. Those differences are what both candidates are banking on and is a reason why neither is liked."" ""Honestly this cultural division has been going on for some time. Perhaps it's the personalities of the two doing the dividing that makes this year's campaign season particularly distasteful. But Detroit, a city that is 90 percent black, voted for a white mayor for the first time in decades. So once again Detroit can show the nation what happens when voters actively decide to shake up the status quo in the name of salvation.”   Jessica Care Moore | Poet, Detroit Advocate Ron Fournier | Associate Publisher, Crain’s Business Detroit Peter Cummings | Real Estate Developer Angie Reyes | Executive Director, Detroit Hispanic Development Corp Yusef Shakur | Neighborhood Activist Khaled Beydoun Associate Professor, University of Detroit Mercy Law Fatina Abdrabboh | Director, American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Dearborn Chuck Stokes | Editorial & Public Affairs Director, WXYZ-TV Ashley McGuire | Senior Fellow, The Catholic Association ‘Strait Talk with Matt & LZ’ will be streamed live on ABCNews.com and on ABC News’ apps on mobile and OTT as well as ABC News’ Facebook page.

757,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers. The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person. The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim. St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times. On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own. Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday. Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family. The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).  St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.” Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him. Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs. Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota. The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls. “This population is also being targeted by Islamist terror organizations like the Islamic State and al-Shabab, a Somalia-based group with links to al Qaeda, according to U.S. officials.” “Among Minnesota-based Somali-Americans, American converts to Islam or Somali refugees, there have been numerous convictions for various levels of collaboration with Islamist terror groups, plus reports of fighting with al-Shabab or other Islamist groups.” “Al-Shabab made a propaganda video warning of an attack on shopping malls around the world, including the Mall of America in Minnesota. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the terror attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya two years ago, which left 67 dead.” In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape. In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat. “Pro-Islamic State Somali militants have grown in numbers and are receiving financial and military support from Yemen, a top intelligence official told the VOA Somali Service.” “He said Islamic State has welcomed its Somalia branch and has started delivering supplies through their affiliate faction in Yemen.” “They received military supplies from Yemen – weapons, uniform, ISIS sent trainers who inspected their bases, and they have started sending financial support,” he said. In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS. In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt to join forces to attack America. Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.  If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%. Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone. It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota. Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum. Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule. A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children. Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong. Selah. By Jeff Rainforth Like Jeff on Facebook Follow Jeff on Twitter ",0,0,1
1471,"In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support. Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.  From the Daily Mail: National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder. A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street. After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants. A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.                         ",0,0,1
145,"Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the âbirtherâ issue, thereâs one pro-Trump surrogate who â in the tightest re-election fight of his life â is still pledging to continue his investigation into President Obamaâs birth certificate. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain Barack Obamaâs birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: âIâm not going to give up, and weâre looking into it. I donât know how itâs going to turn out.Â I donât care where heâs from.Â We are looking at a forged document.Â Period.Â I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys.â The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized by Arpaioâs pledge to unleash the âtruth.â Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him âstuckâ with the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week. According to Arizona Central: Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case andÂ commander of Arpaioâs Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knew Trumpâs statement was a âpunch in the gut, because it was unexpected.âÂ Zullo said he thought Trumpâs statement was âstrategic.âÂ âItâs not going to deter us,â Zullo said. âItâs not going to stop us. I am closer than ever.â Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, theÂ Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened. Well there you have it. Not only are Maricopa County residents footing the bill for Arpaioâs legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another âinvestigationâ into President Obamaâs birth certificate. Is this what Republicans mean by âfiscal responsibility?â In Maricopa County, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. And now they are paying their Sheriffâs office their tax dollars to âinvestigateâ some fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. Think about that. Maybe thatâs why Arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a Democrat, Paul Penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting. Good thing heâs focusing on the issues that matter. ",0,1,0

950,"It’s no coincidence Donald Trump rolled out his child care proposal this week in suburban Philadelphia, with his daughter Ivanka by his side. To win Pennsylvania, the GOP nominee must remain competitive in the populous suburbs that ring the state’s largest city. Recent polls suggest he’s not even close. Story Continued Below And unless Trump can boost his performance on the outskirts of cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio — particularly in the more affluent suburbs where middle-class women and college-educated white voters have eyed him askance — he risks being overwhelmed by the large Democratic margins delivered by the nearby big cities. “He’s played the white, working-class speech,” said Terry Madonna, a veteran Pennsylvania pollster, referring to the message Trump has aimed at working class white men in economically struggling communities. “He’s not really made an appeal to [suburban] individuals.” The suburbs, where 47 percent of all votes were cast in 2012, went narrowly for Romney after voting narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008. This time around, with Trump doing little to tailor his message beyond his base of disaffected white men, he’s lagging far behind Romney’s performance. A Franklin and Marshall College poll in late August showed Hillary Clinton with a 45-31 advantage in the Philadelphia suburbs. An analysis from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed drastic underperformance by Trump in suburban Milwaukee’s Waukesha County, a conservative bastion where GOP candidates typically run up huge margins. While Trump led Clinton by 45 percent to 32 percent over the summer, he was far behind Romney’s pace there — the 2012 GOP nominee carried Waukesha by 67 percent to 32 percent. The story is similar in Virginia, another swing state. According to an August Washington Post poll, Trump was running well behind Romney’s clip in the close-in D.C. suburbs and also in the Northern Virginia exurbs — places like Loudoun County, a critical battleground that Obama won by 5 points in 2012. “I think it's more a matter of tone than it is his platform,” said Val DiGiorgio, chairman of the Republican Party of Chester County, the only one of Philadelphia’s four main suburban counties that Romney won in 2012. “We're a county where fiscal conservatives tend to do very well. If he could convince these folks that he's a fiscal conservative and acts more presidential, he could win over some of these voters. They dislike Hillary so intensely.” GOP leaders and pollsters say Trump can’t win without making inroads in the suburbs — and voters there are turned off by his bluster and sometimes-erratic nature. But many also say Clinton’s unpopularity is keeping Trump in the hunt. “There are some voters out there, they would prefer not to vote for Clinton, but they have yet to see Trump as a viable alternative,” added John Brabender, a GOP strategist who helped steer Rick Santorum to a Senate victory in Pennsylvania. “Trump can still take advantage of it. Trump needs to show a comfort level from a personality and temper standpoint.” Trump’s temperament has been a persistent issue throughout the campaign — nowhere more than in the suburbs — but there are signs an image makeover is underway. Aside from his uneven attempts to moderate some positions, eschew some of his harsher rhetoric and hew more closely to a script with the use of a TelePrompter, the campaign has been dispatching his children and their spouses to the critical suburban counties that could decide his fate. On Sept. 11, Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara made an unannounced stop in Painesville, Ohio — in suburban Cleveland’s Lake County — for a 9/11 memorial event. She’s also been active in her native North Carolina, where she reportedly helped open a field office in the Charlotte suburbs. She’s also joining Trump’s other women surrogates to help soften his image in these key communities. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, stood alongside her father to unveil Trump’s new child care plan in Delaware County, a Democratic-leaning suburb of Philadelphia,. She’s also arranging a trip to Colorado next week — after a Saturday visit to the Denver suburbs by her father — for a series of events. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. was also in Colorado too for events in downtown Denver — one with millennials, one with sportsmen — before heading north for a fundraiser in Windsor. The campaign is also in talks to send one of the Trump kids next month to Chester County, another crucial suburb outside Philadelphia, when the local GOP holds its fall reception. Trump supporters view the candidate's children as highly effective surrogates who can smooth some of the mogul’s rougher edges and articulate (or talk around) some of Trump’s harsher policies and rhetoric, the central challenge Trump has faced to making inroads in the suburbs. “The important thing is that you’re sending people that connect with people in the community,” said Robert Blaha, Trump’s Colorado campaign chairman. “Ivanka coming and talking to young millennial women -- like the role she played last night on the stage — the more you can connect with those groups, the more people can understand the candidate.” The suburbs, of course, aren’t a monolithic voting bloc. While Trump’s struggles appear most acute in the affluent suburbs and among minorities in more mature suburbs, he’s actually well-positioned to make gains in some of the more industrial suburbs, which are prevalent in Ohio. “A lot of suburbs have mini Rust Belts within them, and the same sort of angry, white working class voters have found Trump appealing,” said Larry Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. “When you add it all up, the give and the take, Trump is almost certainly going to do worse than prior Republicans. A big tiebreaker is the number of new immigrants and other minorities, are the fastest growing population bloc in many suburbs.” In Ohio, Levy noted, the Cleveland suburbs are riper targets for Trump because of their industrial tilt, while the Columbus suburbs are full of those more affluent white voters that haven’t warmed to Trump. Suburban Republican leaders say that even in places where Trump may be lagging behind Romney’s performance, they see some recent evidence his fortunes may be improving. “Our polling indicates he's down among the more affluent, suburban part of the county,” DiGiorgio, the Chester County chairman, said. “I'd say he's rebounded since then. He's probably still losing Chester County.” Dale Fellows, chairman of the Cleveland-area Lake County GOP, said he’s seen an uptick in support for Trump among women. He noted the recent visit by Lara Trump, who was accompanied by Trump surrogates Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, the YouTube personalities who go by the names Diamond and Silk. “Republican women are starting to become more engaged,” he said. “That’s, I think, going to make a big difference in the outcome of the election.” In Virginia’s Loudoun County, outside of Washington D.C., Trump is still working to put his base together. “I’ll be honest, that’s something that’s still happening,” said Will Estrada, chairman of the county GOP. But he points to what he views as some optimistic signs — from a mad rush to claim Trump lawn signs to a decision by longtime Trump hater and prominent conservative radio host Mark Levin, a resident of the county in Leesburg, to relent and announce his support for Trump. “Every day that gets closer to Election Day, we’re seeing the base come on board with Donald Trump,” he said.",1,0,0
52,"Former Massachusetts governor and 1988 presidential candidate Michael Dukakis knows a little something about unpredictable election cycles and over-preparing for debates. He spoke to ABC’s Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein this week on the “Powerhouse Politics” podcast and the topic of Hillary Clinton's extensive debate preparation came up. She has reportedly spent the past couple of weeks surrounded by advisers and briefing books, leaving the campaign trail in favor of mock debates. Dukakis advised the Clinton campaign to spend less time preparing for debates on topics she already knows well, because the real winner of the election would be, in his opinion, the campaign with the strongest field organization. “This is not the first time you’ve done this,” Dukakis said of Clinton, noting that most political debaters have had years of practice. “And sure, it’s very important, but lots of other things are important in campaigns. Including your field organization and the people that are working for you.” He advised Clinton to focus more on dealing with Trump's unorthodox approach to debating. ""You've got to be spontaneous, feel spontaneous. It's going to be interesting to see how she deals with the Trump style,"" he said. In his own campaign 30 years ago, Dukakis, who was the longest-serving governor of Massachusetts, had a 17-percentage-point lead over Republican presidential nominee George H.W. Bush after the Democratic National Convention. By the second presidential debate, held at UCLA, he came off to voters as unfeeling when responding to a question about the death penalty and his wife. CNN's Bernard Shaw asked, “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” When Dukakis responded instantly, “No, I don’t, Bernard. And I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life,” reporters and voters were shocked. He cited the inefficacy of the death penalty, but the public saw his response as cold. He told Klein and Karl on ""Powerhouse Politics"" that he found the question fair, and didn't realize how he had done in the debates until someone else told him later. He cited his own over-preparation as the reason for this second debate flop. In this case, his logical and formulaic response did not prevail over the show of emotion that spectators were expecting. In the end, Clinton’s main challenge and focus should be on persuading voters to truly evaluate their opinion of Trump, he said. “This guy has no business being president of the United States,"" he added.

812,"President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at. During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example. Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself. How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so.

678,"Things got very rowdy on CNN, with the guests unable to control their passions for the subject at hand. It got so out of control that it forced host Alisyn Camerota to pull the plug on her guests. Somehow, to no one’s surprise, Donald Trump’s name got dragged into the argument. See the video and read the article.  As Written By Christian Daytok for Daily Caller: Cleveland’s Pastor James Davis and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed yelled at each other for more than a minute straight on CNN’s Thursday broadcast of “New Day,” forcing host Alisyn Camerota to pull the plug on the segment. The two guests had been brought on the panel to discuss ways to fix problems in the black community and how those goals would be achieved through the respective presidential candidates. “The bottom line is, we need school choice,” stated Davis. “We have to pull the education system and put it back in the neighborhood and get it out of these unions’ hands, and the rest of it, because at the end of the day, irrespective of the numbers, it’s too slow.

1203,"The Cincinnati Enquirer, which by its own admission has backed Republican candidates for president “for almost a century,” is endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. “Presidential elections should be about who’s the best candidate, not who’s the least flawed. Unfortunately, that’s not the case this year,” the newspaper’s editorial board wrote in its endorsement, published Friday. “Our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst.” Story Continued Below “That’s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton.” The Enquirer is not the first newspaper to buck a long tradition of endorsing GOP candidates in favor of Clinton. Earlier this month, The Dallas Morning News endorsed the former secretary of state’s White House bid, making her the first Democrat that newspaper has endorsed in over 75 years. And other newspaper editorial boards, some of which have a long history of supporting Republican presidential nominees, have broken for Clinton in 2016. In addition to the Enquirer and the Morning News, the editorial boards of the New York Daily News and the Houston Chronicle also switched to the Democratic nominee this time. (The New York Daily News endorsed Barack Obama in 2008.) The Richmond Times-Dispatch and the New Hampshire Union-Leader, both of which backed Romney four years ago, have opted to go with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson instead. Several swing-state newspapers that backed Romney have also withheld an endorsement to this point, although some did not endorse until October in 2012. Those newspapers include the Arizona Republic, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Orlando Sentinel, the Sun-Sentinel (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.), the Columbus Dispatch, the Detroit News, the Grand Rapids Press, the Des Moines Register, the Florida Times-Union and the Wisconsin State Journal. In its endorsement, the Enquirer called Clinton “a known commodity with a proven track record of governing.” The newspaper praised her willingness to work with Republicans as a senator and her efforts to assist first responders suffering health problems resulting from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It also lauded her work on the Children’s Health Insurance Program as first lady and her support for LGBT rights and efforts to close the pay gap between men and women. Trump, by contrast, poses a “a clear and present danger to our country,” the Enquirer’s editorial board wrote, and lacks any experience in governance and foreign policy. That so many military and national security have refused to back the GOP nominee “speaks volumes” about what type of president he would be, the newspaper said. “His wild threats to blow Iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at U.S. ships is just the type of reckless, cowboy diplomacy Americans should fear from a Trump presidency,” the newspaper’s endorsement said. “Do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem?” The Enquirer’s endorsement of Clinton was not without reservation, however. While it complimented her as a “competent secretary of state,” it also said “mistakes were made in Benghazi, and it was tragic that four Americans lost their lives in the 2012 terror attacks on the U.S. consulate there.” But the newspaper dismissed the concerns that many Republicans have about Clinton’s involvement, or lack thereof, in the attack: “The incident was never the diabolical conspiracy that Republicans wanted us to believe, and Clinton was absolved of blame after lengthy investigations.” Clinton’s “refusal to acknowledge her poor judgment in using a private email server and mishandling classified information is troubling,” the newspaper wrote, as is her “lack of transparency,” evidenced by her recently-snapped streak of 275 days without holding a press conference. But the Enquirer was far more damning of Trump, who the newspaper slammed for backing the so-called “birther” movement and feuding publicly with the parents of a Muslim soldier who was killed in 2004 in Iraq. Trump’s private sector acumen has created jobs, the newspaper admitted, but has also sent jobs overseas and left some who did business with him unpaid. The editorial questioned if Trump makes as much money as he says he does or if he has paid his fair share of taxes, questions the newspaper said have gone unanswered because the Manhattan billionaire has thus far refused to release his tax returns. That Trump has toned down his rhetoric is recent weeks failed to impress the editorial’s authors. “But going two weeks without saying something misogynistic, racist or xenophobic is hardly a qualification for the most important job in the world,” the editorial read. “Why should anyone believe that a Trump presidency would look markedly different from his offensive, erratic, stance-shifting presidential campaign?” “Hillary Clinton has her faults, certainly, but she has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of Americans both inside and outside of Washington,” it continued. “It's time to elect the first female U.S. president – not because she's a woman, but because she's hands-down the most qualified choice.” Madeline Conway contributed to this report.",1,0,0
945,"Jill Stein is a Harvard-trained internist, a doctor who diagnosed thousands of patients for a quarter-century in Boston and Chicago before making the late-career switch to Green Party presidential candidate and could-be Hillary Clinton spoiler. So, as we settled in for our “Off Message” podcast interview last week in a drab hotel conference room in Baltimore (she had a rally there last Friday), I asked Stein — as a clinician used to making snap assessments — whether she agreed that Donald Trump “will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” as declared by the GOP nominee’s Bruce Vilanch-esque personal physician Harold Bornstein. Story Continued Below “You know, I don’t pretend to be able to do TV diagnosis, but I think the guy has a problem,” said the 66-year-old candidate, who is averaging somewhere between 2 percent and 5 percent in most national and state polls, enough (Clinton people say) to put a scare into the Democrat in too-close-to-call states. “The guy has a lot of problems — physical, mental, emotional, cognitive,” Stein said of Trump. As proof of his (alleged) pathology, she pointed to his position-hopping on a range of issues, which she cast as erratic rather than calculating — from his fuzzy Iraq positions over the years, to his brief “softening” on immigration last month, to his decision (on the day we spoke) to suddenly renounce birtherism after five years of banging a drumbeat of lies. “It’s hard to, you know, to think too hard about anything Donald Trump says because he will change his mind in the next hour, if not the next day, or whatever,” she added. “Today, suddenly, after five years, he became convinced that it’s not an issue. Yesterday it was an issue. It will probably become an issue again for him. You know, the guy may have a memory problem. Who knows what it is? But he’s incapable of having a consistent thought or policy.” Stein also thinks Trump’s getting a free pass because he spent his career in private business, and she wants him to release his tax returns. (She wants everybody else to do the same.) “At least with Clinton, you know, there was some degree of transparency,” she said. “But what’s going on with Trump, you can’t even get at, and what he said was that even to clarify 15 out of these 500 deals, these are just like the most frightening mafiosos around the world. He’s like — he’s a magnet for crime and extortion.” A veteran protester who has had brushes with the law, Stein has a bit of Carrie Nation ferocity about her, but she also has a soothing, therapeutic mien — precisely the person you’d go to if you developed an unexplained rash after chaining yourself to a fracking facility. Stein got 460,000 votes as an outsider candidate in 2012 for a left-of-left, anti-war party steeped in environmental issues, but adamantly denies any role as a spoiler. She won’t say whether she can better Ralph Nader’s 2.7 million total for the party in 2000 and generally avoids the whole Al Gore-Florida-handing-W-the-White House thing. And she claims that she’s drawing disaffected Bernie-or-Bust voters who never, ever would have voted for Clinton anyway — many of whom might have actually voted for Trump. (I told her I don’t buy that.) As much as Stein despises Trump — and she really, really does — she describes the choice between him and Hillary Clinton as an abominable binary offering “death by gunshot or death by strangulation.” But her contempt has a more cutting quality when she talks about Clinton. She mocks Trump as braying menace; Stein thinks he’s, at heart, a bumbler who would be neutered by his own party after being elected. But it’s Clinton who poses the greater threat, in Stein’s estimation, because she knows how to move the levers of Washington. “Donald Trump, I think, will have a lot of trouble moving things through Congress,” Stein explains. “Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, won’t. … Hillary has the potential to do a whole lot more damage, get us into more wars faster, to pass her fracking disastrous climate program, much more easily than Donald Trump could do his.” This is a boutique opinion among mainstream liberals, to put it politely. And a lot of people, Democrats and pollsters among them, see in Stein and her more popular Libertarian counterpart Gary Johnson (whose support flirts with double digits) as potent threats to Clinton because they draw disproportionately from her potential supporters, especially among younger voters. The TBS host and satirist Samantha Bee, who makes no secret about wanting to see the first female president elected, is so infuriated with Stein she refuses to even show her picture on TV — and encouraged Stein backers to mail their complaints to her vagina, though she used a different word. Stein is used to this kind of thing and believes she is taking one for the lefty team. Earlier this year, she hinted about dropping out if Sanders stayed in and still pines a bit for the Hillary-backing Vermont socialist. “I’ve tried to talk with Bernie, but, you know, Bernie is — he is a team player,” she said, lamenting his refusal to even chat with her. “I think he’s on the wrong team, perhaps because he’s been in Washington, D.C., too long, because he used to really understand independent politics and why we cannot have a viable political system unless we have independent political parties. … Maybe it’s a generational thing.” Sanders, stumping for Clinton over the weekend, dismissed Stein and Johnson as a self-defeating “protest vote” but there’s more than a little truth to her argument that third-party candidates will lure voters away from the Democratic nominee, with some polls showing a quarter to a third of under-30 voters opting for Stein, Johnson or none of the above. “The millennial problem is real,” a senior Clinton aide recently told me. “It shouldn’t be overstated, but we have work to do.” Like Sanders, Stein has an affection for Russia and a soft spot for Botox strongman Vladimir Putin. Critics like Clinton ally Neera Tanden have noted just how often Stein appears on the Putin-controlled cable network RT. And a gushing video Stein recorded after her appearance at a democracy conference in Moscow earlier this year sparked all sorts of speculation on the part of Team Clinton about a broader Cyrillic conspiracy to undermine the Democratic nominee that included Trump, his former aide Paul Manafort and Hillary-hating WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, whom Stein has spoken about in heroic terms. When I asked her whether Putin is a despot, I got a yes-and-no answer, with traces of Trumpian ambivalence. “To some extent, yes, but there could be a whole lot worse,” Stein said when I asked about the reportedly rigged Russian elections this year. “When we needlessly provoke him and endanger him and surround him with war games — this is sort of the Cuban missile crisis on steroids … and I don’t think this is a good idea.” Moreover, she doesn’t think Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee email system or that Putin is trying to sway the election in Trump’s favor — despite U.S. officials’ claims to the contrary and media reports that the Russian president is hell-bent on seeing Clinton defeated. “I don’t think we have evidence — there is really no hard evidence” of Putin’s meddling, she said. “We need to take a deep breath on this. This really doesn’t seem to be happening.” The other controversy ensnaring Stein is questions over her commitment to vaccinations, after comments she made earlier this year expressing sharp skepticism about the Food and Drug Administration and its willingness to buck corporate interests to produce safe formulations. On this topic she is less equivocal, and says she sees zero link between autism and vaccinations, although she remains concerned about the developmental impact of chemicals included in shots given to small children. Stein is extremely fastidious about her health (she sipped on an organic berry smoothie before our talk) and is acutely conscious of the environment, and not only in the abstract sense. At one point during our chat, after a bout of coughing, she pointed to the well-worn hotel carpet and told me the chemicals used to cover up the dirt are so toxic she spreads sheets on the floor every time she’s in a big-chain hotel. She is an ex-marathoner who clears her email inbox every morning during a brisk six-mile walk and has no detectable body fat. Thus, it is one of the small jokes in a big-joke 2016 that both Stein and Johnson are ultra-buff exercise freaks who are in far better shape than the puffier major-party candidates. As we were discussing Trump and Clinton’s dueling doctor’s notes, she offered the following declaration: “I am healthy, yes. I assume I have the lowest blood pressure of any candidate,” she said running a long finger down the medical office-type clipboard, stuffed with clips and talking points, that she totes everywhere. Cool. Trust but verify. Clinton provided her numbers — could she produce hers? “Last I recall it was around 110/70,” Stein said. “I’m sorry. Hillary Clinton has a 100/70,” I said. A few minutes into the podcast, an aide had handed Stein a note informing her she had (as expected) been locked out of the debates, and she responded with a smiling shrug. The blood-pressure revelation elicited a graver response. “Are you serious?” Stein said, pausing — before offering Clinton a challenge. “Man. … Well, I would be happy to run a race with her anytime.”",1,0,0
1216,"Hillary Clinton's campaign announced late Friday that it was postponing a trip by the Democratic nominee to Charlotte scheduled for Sunday. ""After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday's trip as not to impact the City's resources,"" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote in a statement. ""She will plan to visit Charlotte next Sunday, provided circumstances allow."" Story Continued Below The rescheduling comes after Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts made a public plea to Clinton and Donald Trump to delay any campaign trips to the city in light of their ""very stressed resources."" Clinton's campaign had announced the trip earlier Friday. Palmieri added: ""Her prayers are with the people of Charlotte during these difficult times."" Donald Trump wasted no time in responding to Clinton's reversal on social media, accusing his opponent of trying to ""grandstand"" and calling her initial decision to go to Charlotte ""dumb."" ""Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!"" the Republican nominee tweeted late Friday. Trump was reportedly considering traveling to Charlotte next week following the presidential debate Monday, but has not elaborated on those plans. He incorrectly identified Clinton's initial trip as scheduled for Saturday. Protests have erupted in Charlotte since Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday afternoon. The outcry over yet another officer-involved killing of a black person, days after an officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, shot and killed Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands up when he was fatally struck, turned violent late Wednesday into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to issue a state of emergency. Earlier Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee called on police to release the video of the shooting — after Scott’s family had released its own cellphone video recorded by Scott’s wife, Rakeyia Scott. “Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides,” she wrote on Twitter, signing her message with “-H” to denote it came from her, not her campaign.",1,0,0
646,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team."" Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle. The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution. ""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama. President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy."" He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won."" Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect."" Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.  It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist. It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse. It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality. Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam. Source: Conservative Tribune  Tags: ISIS, Obama",0,0,1

1116,"Pat Toomey is your classic, pro-trade Republican. The former president of the free trade-promoting Club for Growth has backed a slew of trade deals during his 12 years in Congress, and last year he even praised President Barack Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership as an economic boon that would help Pennsylvania’s economy. Then along came Donald Trump and his America-first, trade-bashing platform. Now Toomey — among the most vulnerable incumbent Republicans up for reelection this fall — is urging Obama to dump the TPP. Story Continued Below Toomey has plenty of company among Republicans on the Senate ballot. The GOP’s unshakable faith in free trade has been decidedly broken in the year of Trump — with everyone from a former U.S. trade representative, Rob Portman of Ohio, to free-market devotee Marco Rubio of Florida striking a much different tone. Indeed, the upended politics of trade offer a major conundrum for establishment-minded Republicans running for reelection this year, particularly in Rust Belt states that could help determine control of the Senate next year. Perhaps more than any other issue, trade has illustrated the tightrope GOP candidates have to walk in trying to appeal to Trump-fueled voters while not abandoning the GOP’s core economic principles. “I’ve always believed that you actually have to get an agreement that merits the support,” Toomey said in an interview when asked whether his TPP opposition was inconsistent with his record. Pointing to its dairy and intellectual property provisions, Toomey, who was careful never to explicitly endorse the trade deal as it was being negotiated, added: “There are real problems with TPP.” Of the Republicans who are running in the most closely watched Senate races this cycle, just two have publicly embraced the controversial trade deal: John McCain of Arizona — who warned that the United States’ future in Asia hinges on the TPP — and Mark Kirk of Illinois. One other Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, is favorable toward TPP’s agriculture provisions but won’t weigh in on the other parts. Back in April 2015, Rubio wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and urged passage of TPP, which would “further our strategic goals in Asia and increase prosperity at home.” In an interview with POLITICO this week, Rubio said he is still evaluating the trade deal but noted that he was “disappointed” with results of a report from the International Trade Commission that gauged the TPP’s economic impact. Pressed on whether his concerns about the TPP constitute a reversal, Rubio responded, “How can it be? You can’t endorse a deal that isn’t written yet.” “The TPP as a concept is something I support. I’d love to have a free trade agreement with the Asia-Pacific region. But it has to be the right deal,” Rubio said. “Just like I support home ownership, but it has to be under the right terms.” Rep. Todd Young (R-Ind.), running for the Senate seat in Indiana, says he has “real problems” with TPP because its intellectual property provisions could harm Eli Lilly and Co., a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Indianapolis. And Republican Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire have their own problems with the trade deal with Asia. In Ayotte’s case, she’s even cited trade as one area on which she agrees with Trump. All of them voted in favor of a procedural measure last year that would allow Obama to ultimately fast-track the trade deal without any amendments. The election-year shift on trade is not limited to Republicans. Hillary Clinton famously pivoted on TPP after praising the deal as the “gold standard” of trade agreements as secretary of state. And Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was praising provisions of the TPP just days before he was selected as Clinton’s running mate. As soon as he joined the ticket, Kaine came out in opposition to the Pacific Rim deal. Back in Pennsylvania, Toomey and his allies correctly point out that Katie McGinty, Toomey’s Democratic challenger, supported and touted the North American Free Trade Agreement as an official in the Clinton administration. But the Republican sprint away from the TPP is a remarkable policy reversal for a party that has traditionally championed itself as the party of free trade. “On the campaign trail, it’s just too difficult to quantify the gains from free trade and too easy to point at a plant that closed and scapegoat trade,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said. He added that Trump was “obviously” a factor and said in an election year, “it always comes up like this. But it seems to be bigger this year.” McCain has warned that U.S. influence in Asia could diminish if Congress doesn’t approve TPP. And another reason that explains McCain’s warmth for trade, despite its decreasing popularity: Arizona’s robust trade relationship with neighboring Mexico that amounts to $16 billion in goods and services exchanged per year. “I believe in free trade, and I’m a student of history,” McCain said in defending his support for the deal, which Democratic challenger Ann Kirkpatrick opposes. Nowhere does the political toxicity over trade resonate more than in labor-heavy states, with unions vehemently opposing the deal and Democrats trying to stoke that sentiment to turn out those voters against Republicans. In Nevada, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto expressed her opposition to the TPP months ago and has underscored that stance in front of union audiences such as the AFL-CIO. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Joe Heck — who also voted to fast-track the trade deal last year — has declined to take an official position on the agreement, though he said he had “some concerns” about some of the trade deal’s provisions. “I think it’s difficult when you have a trade agreement with so many disparate partners that it’s hard to strike a good balance,” Heck said in an interview. He did not elaborate on his concerns. The massive trade deal’s prospects this year on Capitol Hill have all but evaporated, despite an intense public relations campaign from the Obama administration that continued through last week. An undeterred Obama hosted an elaborate event promoting the 12-nation deal last week, even marshaling Ohio Gov. John Kasich — a GOP presidential candidate vanquished by Trump earlier this year — to the White House to help press his case. Yet Ohio’s own incumbent GOP senator, Portman—who has a lengthy pro-trade record and counts Kasich as one of his most powerful boosters—came out in opposition to the Pacific Rim trade deal in February. Democrat Ted Strickland, who has struggled to gain traction, has hammered Portman over his past support of trade deals. But Portman, like Toomey, said his stances on trade have been consistent. “It hasn’t put me in a tough position because I’ve taken the same position for years … which is balanced trade,” he said. “We should open up more markets but we also have to make sure it’s fair as imports come into our country. So I’m very comfortable with that position and that’s where most Ohioans are.” Few expect Capitol Hill to act on the TPP while Obama remains in office, despite pressure from its advocates to take it up in the lame duck. Details of the massive trade deal remain largely unknown to voters; an August poll from Morning Consult showed that 62 percent of registered voters said they had heard little or nothing about the agreement. That same poll found that about 35 percent of voters support the trade deal and 22 percent oppose it, but 43 percent had no opinion. Meanwhile, other Republicans running for reelection have simply declined to answer questions about their TPP position. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has yet to take a stance on TPP and declined in an interview to say whether he even has any concerns. He rebuffed Democratic challenger Russ Feingold’s attempts to needle him into a position, accusing Feingold of making a “knee-jerk snap decision” on TPP. “This is over 6,000 pages. He read a 60-page leaked version on WikiLeaks?” Johnson said of the deal, which has numerous chapters and totals more than 5,000 pages, especially because it includes extensive lists of every tariff being cut. “I’m not feeling any pressure whatsoever. I’m actually doing my job and doing the hard work that I think Wisconsinites expect out of their senator.” Elena Schneider and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1155,"Eric Ueland, a veteran Republican Capitol Hill aide and top staffer on the Senate Budget Committee, is advising Donald Trump's presidential transition team, according to three sources. Ueland is the Republican staff director on the Budget Committee, a position he has held since 2013, when he was hired by Sen. Jeff Sessions, then the panel's ranking member. Ueland stayed on as staff director when Sen. Mike Enzi became chairman of the committee in 2015. Story Continued Below Sessions has emerged as an influential figure in Trump's universe, with several former Sessions aides taking prominent positions in Trump's transition and campaign.

Ueland and the Trump campaign declined to comment. The Trump transition, which is being led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is rapidly expanding its pool of policy advisers, with sources telling POLITICO it is setting up a series of policy-specific teams on issues like financial services, taxes and energy.

893,"Donald Trump’s charity non-profit Trump Foundation does not exist for its stated purpose of helping those in need, unless one believes Trump himself is among the needy. Yes, Trump was so desperately in need he used the Trump Foundation’s funds to purchase himself a lunch with a Hollywood actress. In 2008, Trump was a guest at a Gucci charity auction where he had an opportunity to bid on something he found too irresistible to pass up: a trip to France which included lunch with Salma Hayek which would take place in the husband of Hayek billionaire François-Henri Pinault’s vineyard. Comedian Chris Rock was hosting the auction and said the auction included “Salma Hayek and her breasts“, which was like blood in the water for Trump. He feverishly bid on the potential meeting all the way up to the tune of $120,000 of the Trump Foundation’s money. Surely a ritzy meal in a billionaire’s vineyard was the best way for Trump to help the needy. Trump bidding on the auction trip with the foundation’s money very likely violated a non-profit law which prohibits “self-dealing” as 501c3 organizations are required to disclose any use of money to purchase gifts for an organization’s executives. Trump’s campaign says he did not personally take the trip, but could also not offer an elaboration as to who did actually take the trip to France. Even if Trump had given the trip to a family member, he would still be in violation. For her part Hayek, while a guest on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on March 30, 2016, said she and Trump have known each other for many years but did not state when they first met. She went on to call Trump’s politics “madness” and wondered why so many individuals are supporting him.  In later media appearances, Hayak was not nearly as charitable about Donald Trump. While a guest on “The Late Late Show With James Corden” on August 4, 2016 Hayak said of Trump, “We have a first-grade boy running for President of the United States.”  Hayek has not been quiet about Trump ‘s hateful rhetoric but she gave him points for showing the world racism still exists. While being interviewed on “America with Jorge Ramos” on August 6, 2016 Hayak said, “The good thing about what Trump did is that it’s shown a light to the level of the problem of racism.”  It is safe to say that during their years of knowing one another Hayek has had enough of Trump’s sub-human personality, and if the two were to meet and converse in the future it would be a terse conversation.",0,1,0
517,"Washington (CNN)House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters the House will vote this week on a resolution holding Bryan Pagliano, the former Hillary Clinton aide who helped set up her private email server, in contempt of Congress. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz tweeted that he filed a resolution Tuesday. The Oversight Committee approved the GOP-led contempt resolution last week along a straight party line. The floor vote is expected to come Thursday or Friday, according to a senior House GOP leadership aide. Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, has argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify. ""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt."" Pagliano was first called before the oversight committee last week but did not appear. Pagliano pleaded the Fifth Amendment in a closed-door hearing last year of the House panel investigating the Benghazi attacks. Pagliano's lawyers last week accused Chaffetz of launching a witch hunt. ""A subpoena issued by a congressional committee is required by law to serve a valid legislative purpose -- and there is none here. Your demand under the present circumstances, that Mr. Pagliano again assert his constitutional rights in front of video cameras six weeks before the presidential election, betrays a naked political agenda and furthers no valid legislative aim,"" Pagliano's lawyers wrote in a letter to the committee. The Clinton campaign said Thursday it had not told Pagliano whether or not to testify, and blasted the oversight hearings into her private email server. ""He made his own decision, but we certainly have not prevailed upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said. ""The career officials at the FBI and the Justice Department already thoroughly investigated this matter, and closed the case with no further action, and Jason Chaffetz is abusing his office with this blatantly partisan attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.""

271,"Washington (CNN)A daughter of Robert Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, said in a Facebook post that former Republican President George H.W. Bush told her he's voting for -- wait for it -- Hillary Clinton. Townsend, a Democrat who served as Maryland lieutenant governor for eight years and goes by Hartington online, posted a photo with the former president to Facebook: ""The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!"" wrote Kennedy Townsend, a niece of President John F. Kennedy. Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Bush, did not confirm nor deny the claim. ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,"" McGrath told CNN. ""He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim."" Townsend met with Bush at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, during a board meeting for the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation. Sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN's Jamie Gangel they were surprised and disappointed that she had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president.

The president vetoed the bill Friday, citing concerns that it could open the U.S. government to similar lawsuits. ""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. The White House is also concerned that the bill could tarnish the U.S. relationship with the Gulf nation. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. But the bill passed with unanimous voice votes in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, meaning the veto override, set for a Senate vote Wednesday and House vote by Friday, will likely get the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed to pass. “I look forward to the opportunity for Congress to override the President’s veto, provide these families with the chance to seek the justice they deserve, and send a clear message that we will not tolerate those who finance terrorism in the United States,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a statement Friday. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.",1,0,0

287,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are deadlocked in North Carolina, according to a new poll released Tuesday. The poll from Elon University found Trump leading Clinton by 1 point among likely voters, 44% to 43%, a statistical tie, within the 3.86-point margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson drew 6% support, while another 6% said they were undecided. Clinton and Trump maintain large advantages in North Carolina with key constituencies -- Clinton receives the support of 98% of black voters, while Trump is backed by 65% of white voters. The gender divide is less severe, however, as Clinton leads Trump among women by 6 points while Trump's advantage among men is 10 points. Majorities said that both Trump and Clinton were worse than typical Republican and Democrat candidates for president, though more were likely to describe Clinton than Trump as ""about the same as usual."" The Elon poll also surveyed likely voters on their perceptions of the candidates' health -- a major focus in the presidential race after Clinton was diagnosed with a case of pneumonia two weeks ago. Seventy-seven percent of North Carolina voters said they think Trump is healthy enough to be president, but only 56% said the same about Clinton. Opinions were sharply divided along partisan lines. Additionally, just under half said that both Clinton and Trump had not provided enough medical information. With fewer than 50 days remaining in the race, 6% of North Carolina likely voters said they remain undecided, according to the poll. But when asked if they had to choose between Clinton, Trump and Johnson, 35% chose Clinton, compared to 18% for Trump and Johnson each. When Johnson voters were asked to choose between Clinton and Trump, slightly more said they prefer Trump, though nearly 4 in 10 continued to indicate no preference. North Carolina likely voters were also asked if they thought Russian President Vladimir Putin or President Barack Obama was a better leader, likely prompted by Trump's recent comments that Putin has been ""far more"" of a leader than Obama. Overall, 60% chose Obama, while 23% said Putin -- but a plurality (39%) of Republicans chose Putin, with about a quarter saying they ""don't know."" The Elon University poll of North Carolina surveyed 644 likely voters, with a margin of error of +/- 3.86 points. It was conducted from September 12-16. ",1,0,0

878,"Police brutality has never truly left America’s national conversation, but it had taken a back seat to the presidential election circus until video showed Tulsa police shooting and killing Terence Crutcher in cold blood. It was all too much for one small town Ohio police chief, and his moving words have started gone viral on social media according to PINAC News: But Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw said he could not remain silent after watching Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby shoot and kill Terence Crutcher, tweeting the following message Tuesday, which has been retweeted almost 6,000 times as of this writing. The video showing an Oklahoma cop shoot and kill Terence Crutcher after he had his hands in the air, only to later claim he was not complying, is so outrageous that even an Ohio police chief took to social media to voice his disgust. And that is something we never see. According to local media in his hometown of Middleton, Chief Muterspaw wrote on his Facebook page that if police officers “can’t do the job or are scared of people different than you, then get out of the job. You are making us all look bad. STOP.” “It could be us tomorrow,” Muterspaw told the Journal-News. “You have to look at it. It’s not second-guessing anybody. It’s training for us. It’s a chance to learn from it. We are not robots. We have an opinion too. If it makes our department better and keeps our officers safer, if it makes the city better we should speak out about it.” He said Middletown officers have removed 137 weapons from suspects this year without firing their guns. Then he went onto twitter and fired off a pair of tweets heard round the world. Here’s the Chief’s two public tweets, which were embedded into PINAC News’ story before he took his account private after gaining national attention:  The message isn’t resonating in Tulsa, where officers have stuck to their hokum story that Terence Crutcher tried to reach into his car window for a gun – even though a video shows clearly that the window was closed. Now officers are trying to slander Crutcher claiming that it’s all a drug related issue, an obvious attempt to discredit their dead victim – which curiously, they hadn’t tried to do until his killing gained national attention. In any case, we don’t recall drug posession carrying the death penalty in United States of America, or the suspension of his right to a fair trial. Now Department of Justice officials are going to investigate the Tulsa officer who killed Crutcher, and with any luck field criminal charges against the cop whose story has frequently changed to desperately try and justify her lethal actions. Chief Muterspaw’s impassioned call to the professionalism of police, to empathy in their daily life and his commitment to less violent policing is a lesson that one good cop won’t spoil the bunch. Sadly, this is newsworthy because he’s quite possibly the only high ranking police official in America who is (or was) openly siding with Americans, and siding with citizens right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",0,1,0
1555,"Say what you want about Donald Trump, but he knows a thing or two about the power of social media. Case in point. On Monday, the Trump campaign unveiled its very own Snapchat filter ahead of the debate. It says “Debate Day” with “Donald J.

To which I say, “Everyone under the age of 28.” OK– that’s a rough estimate. But Snapchat is really hot with millennials. I even find myself going on frequently to check out the new filters.

1331,"Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.” Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past. Story Continued Below “Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.” The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].” Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.” “I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”",1,0,0
553,"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore. The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%.  The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category. Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia.  Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum.  The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program.  Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year.  Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns.  Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care.  Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent. Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women.  So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump. Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”.  While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned,  the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes.  He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”.  Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his.  However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box. Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients.  Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”.  Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said.

1618,"#5. Denmark pays students $900 a month to attend college. Thanks to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ proud identification as a Democratic Socialist and allusion to Denmark as an ideal social democracy, Denmark is being discussed throughout the news media. But what few outlets are brave enough to report is that, by almost every measurable standard, Danish socialism runs circles around American capitalism. Here are a few examples:  Denmark has a tremendous social safety net for unemployed workers — any worker who worked at least 52 weeks over a three-year period can qualify to have 90 percent of their original salary paid for, for up to two years. The Danish government also has plentiful training programs for out-of-work Danes. As a result, 73 percent of Danes between 15 and 64 have a paying job, compared to 67 percent of Americans. World Bank data on healthcare costs in developed nations. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), the US spends twice as much per capita on healthcare than in Denmark, where taxpayer-funded universal healthcare is available for all citizens. 2009 OECD data shows that the U.S. spent an average of $7,290 per person on healthcare. Denmark spent just $3,512. World Bank data, as seen in the chart above, shows Danish healthcare costs are about $3,000 less per capita than in the US.  The World Happiness Report, which determines which nation’s population is the “happiest” using criteria like life expectancy, GDP, social safety nets, as well as factors like “perception of corruption” and “freedom to make life choices,” found that Denmark was the happiest country. The US, in the meantime, ranked #17 on the same list.  Denmark leads every other OECD nation in work-life balance. Danes work an average of 37 hours a week, earn an average of $46,000 USD annually, and have the right to 5 weeks of paid vacation per year. Here in the US, the average worker puts in an average of 47 hours a week, and only takes 16 days of vacation a year. This is largely due to a more stressful work climate, in which wages are stagnating while costs are rising. Combine that with a highly-competitive job market, and that means more Americans are willing to chain themselves to their desk then to risk taking vacation days and coming back to find someone else took their job. An actual college campus in Denmark. Here in the US, the cost of going to college has soared by over 500 percent in the last 30 years. But in Denmark, not only is college free, but students are actually paid $900 USD per month to go to school, provided they live on their own. And this funding lasts up to six years. By contrast, the average US student pays over $31,000 a year in tuition to attend a private university, out-of-state residents at public universities pay $22,000 a year in tuition, and tuition costs for in-state residents at those same universities is still over $9,000. Per capita income data from the World Bank. In Denmark, despite a short work week and a generous social safety net, workers make more than enough to meet basic needs. According to per capita income data from the World Bank, Denmark’s per capita income is roughly $5,000 higher than in the US.  The benefits of living in Denmark are far-reaching — out of all OECD countries, Denmark has the second-lowest poverty rate at 0.6 percent. To compare, the OECD average of 11.3 percent is still lower than the 14.5  percent poverty rate in the US. So all this socialist nanny-state coddling must be making all the businesses flee Denmark as fast as they can, right? Wrong.  In 2014, Forbes ranked Denmark as the #1 best country for business. Forbes used 11 different criteria to rank countries — innovation, property rights, red tape, taxes, investor protection, stock market performance, technology, corruption, personal freedom, freedom of trade, and monetary freedom. Under the same criteria, the US ranked #18.  The Danish government gives new parents an average of 52 weeks — a full year — of paid time off after having a child. Those 52 weeks can be allocated however the parents wish. In addition to the 52 weeks, new moms get 4 weeks of maternity leave before giving birth and 14 weeks after. Even new fathers get 2 additional weeks after the birth of their child. But here in the US, 1 in 4 new mothers go back to work within two weeks of having a child. This is what Democratic Socialism really looks like. Is this the dystopian nightmare that Republicans are making it out to be, or an ideal vision of what Americans could have if we came together and demanded it from our government?          ",0,1,0
1503,"The rampant corruption and fraud has gotten so widespread in our government and electoral system that the politicians don’t even try to hide it anymore. It’s massive and we just let it happen. I don’t support either candidate this time around, so I have nothing to lose (except my country and the Constitution) in this horse race. But it looks to me like the electoral tide favors Trump. With Hillary’s health and ever increasing stack of scandals, Trump seems to be the only alternative and that just pisses Obama off. At a minimum, about 15% of illegal immigrants will vote in this election. It will probably be much higher in those states where they have relaxed or negated voter ID laws. The illegal immigrants they ‘accidentally’ gave citizenship to were no accident. This is part and parcel of their plan to terraform the voting demographic across the nation. Many of the refugees they are bringing in will also vote illegally. I’m sure they have been instructed to. This is about power and control for the Marxists.  From Fox News: An internal Obama administration email shows immigration officials may be literally working overtime to swear in as many new “citizen voters” as possible before the Nov. 8 presidential election, a powerful lawmaker charged Thursday. The email, from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office chief and part of a chain of correspondence within the agency, urges the unnamed recipient to swear in as many citizens as possible “due to the election year.” “The Field Office due to the election year needs to process as many of their N-400 cases as possible between now and FY 2016,” reads the email, which was disclosed to FoxNews.com by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “If you have cases in this category or other pending, you are encouraged to take advantage of the OT if you can,” the email continues. “This will be an opportunity to move your pending naturalization cases. If you have not volunteered for OT, please consider and let me know if you are interested.” Parts of the email were redacted before it was disclosed to FoxNews.com, but it was sent by the branch chief of the Houston Field Office District 17. It was not clear to whom it was addressed. It’s not just the illegal and refugee vote either… the Democrats have started a huge push overseas to get Americans abroad to vote. Approximately 85% of them usually don’t, but that may change this year. They are actively being contacted and urged to vote for Hillary Clinton. Then you have the voting machines themselves out of Venezuela which I contend are manipulated for votes as well. Once again, you will see people bused in to vote at locations which is also not legal or ethical. Americans are going to have to rise up at some point and stop this. We are no longer a free voting Republic… we now exist under the illusion of freedom, when in fact our elections are rigged and it matters not what or who we vote for. The email above shows how the Democrats are illegally padding the voter roles. There is literally nothing they won’t do to win this time around. And they don’t care who knows it. They think they are above the law now and no one will stop them. Maybe they are right.  ",0,0,1
140,"In 2011, St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot and killed Anthony Lamar Smith, a drug suspect that he was trying to arrest. At the time, Stockley claimed that he saw Smith reaching for a gun, which is why he fired his. Self-defense, thatâs all it ever is, isnât it? The problem isâ¦Smith was unarmed and now thereâs not just evidence of that, but thereâs also evidence that Stockley may have done worse than lie. There is a strong possibility that he planted the gun in Smithâs car after murdering him to cover his own ass. Smith did flee the scene of a possible drug deal and a high-speed chase ensued. Stockley was carrying a personally-owned AK-47 that Smith, in escaping, almost knocked out of his hands. Stockley was not authorized to carry that weapon while on duty, which goes a long way towards demonstrating Stockley as an unethical officer at the very least. He was also recorded as saying that he was going to kill Smith. Stockleyâs partner, Brian Bianchi, said that he warned Stockley about a revolver on the seat of Smithâs car, and Stockley himself said he feared Smith was about to pull the revolver when he approached: âBefore striking me [with his car], I observed, in plain view in the subjectâs hand while resting on the passenger seat, a silver handgun. The handgun was pointing up and towards meâ¦ Because of the presence of a weapon and because I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy, as was the safety of P.O. Bianchi, and bystanders, I fired several shots at the subject.â Itâs apparently hard to see in the videos whether Stockley handled the revolver; however, itâs damned telling that only his DNA was on the gun. Something of Smith would definitely have been there if heâd been handling the gun, as Stockley alleged. The St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners did pay a $900,000 settlement to Smithâs family in 2013, but Stockley himself was not charged with murder. That is, until this year, when this new evidence came to light. Stockley is now charged with first-degree murder, but is free on a $1 million bond. He left the St. Louis Police Department in 2013.

884,"This Sunday, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick once again knelt in protest of police brutality during the national anthem of another NFL game. The very next day, video of yet another African-American being shot to death by police went viral, notwithstanding the fact that the victim, 40-year-old, Terence Crutcher, was unarmed and had his hands up at the time of his death. “His car was broken down, he was looking for help and he got murdered,” Kaepernick said. “That’s a perfect example of what [my protest] is about. I think it will be very telling what happens with the officers that killed him because everybody’s eyes will be on this.” The day after the footage of Crutcher’s murder was released, the response immediately affected Charlotte, North Carolina as riots spread throughout the area’s poorest neighborhoods. Kapernick took to Twitter to lament the tragedy and reassert his position, but his argument had already been proven for him in the worst way by police. With his protests, Kaepernick originally brought more attention to his disrespect for “the flag” than to police brutality due to the media’s fixation with his kneeling during the national anthem. But the death of Terence Crutcher served as a reminder of the point, the ruthlessness with which police treat people of color in America. “There’s a lot of racism in this country disguised as patriotism,” Kaepernick said, “and people want to take everything back to the flag but that’s not what we’re talking about. We’re talking about racial discrimination, inequalities and injustices that happen across this nation.” According to the Guardian, 1,146 people were killed at the hands of the police last year. So far in 2016, police have killed more than 706 people according to the Washington Post and 790 according to the Guardian. And since Kaepernick’s protest began, police have killed at least 67 people. Of these numbers, an unevenly high percentage of those killed by police have been African-Americans. And while the number of incidents with police would suggest a high likelihood of indictment of aggressors, police are almost never convicted of wrongdoing in cases involving police officers, even when there is video evidence of lawbreaking. All of this points away from an isolated event and towards a larger institutional issue with American law enforcement. And as the tally climbs higher every day, it becomes easier and easier to expose the faux-patriotism used to critique of Kaepernicks’ protest, as just another way to avoid having a serious conversation about racial injustice in this country and to punish a person of color for daring to question the status quo.",0,1,0
134,"Donald Trump, Jr. seems to have taken over as his father’s campaign’s Supervisor of Offensive Posts, particularly with some of his most recent tweets. One was of a bowl of Skittles, and asked us the really asinine question of whether we’d eat those Skittles if we knew three of them were poisoned, but not which ones. He’s (rightfully) caught an awful lot of flack for that, but he likely didn’t expect to catch it from the man who took that photo. He probably also didn’t expect the photographer to be who he is: A refugee living in the U.K. David Kittos fled Turkish occupation of Cyprus in the 1970s and has been living in the U.K. ever since. He is (quite understandably) angry by Trump Jr.’s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: “This was not done with my permission, I don’t support his politics and I would never take his money to use it. In 1974, when I was six-years old, I was a refugee from the Turkish occupation of Cyprus so I would never approve the use of this image against refugees.” Oops. That’s only a minor faux pas – oh wait. It’s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees. Kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash. He’s not on Twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on Flickr. Just is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people? We digress. Anyway. Kittos’ photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. Trump Jr. and others, like the disgraceful former Congresscritter Joe Walsh, don’t seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous. Wrigley, the makers of Skittles candy, also upbraided Trump Jr. for his baloney: “Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it is an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.” For his part, Kittos isn’t sure if he’s going to pursue legal action. However, he did say: “I would like the Trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what I have to say. I was thinking about getting lawyers involved but I don’t know if I have the patience. This isn’t about the money for me. They could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library. This is pure greed from them. I don’t think they care about my feelings. They should not be stealing an image full stop.” And they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they’re the so-called “law and order campaign” that they claim to be. But that’s beside the point. Kittos is, himself, a refugee. It’s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image. It also speaks to the insanely tone-deaf nature of the Trump campaign. They don’t care about such trivia as long as their point is made. ",0,1,0
418,"(CNN)Early numbers from Iowa and North Carolina, where voters are already casting absentee ballots, look promising for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. And Democrats have also improved their position on the voter rolls in Colorado and Florida, outpacing Republicans in the past month, according to a CNN analysis of newly released statistics. Where and when to vote early Voters in a handful of states have already started to request, receive, and cast absentee ballots, and some states publicly disclose how many Republicans and Democrats have requested ballots. Of course, there is no guarantee that all voters will stay loyal to their party when they cast their ballot, and no results from any states will be announced until polls close on Election Day, November 8. In North Carolina, more than 56,000 people have requested absentee ballots: 36% of them were Democrats and 35% were Republicans. Another 28% were independents, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. Over 3,600 ballots already cast in North Carolina More than 3,600 people in North Carolina have apparently they've decided that they've seen enough of the 2016 campaign and already cast their ballots. It's a tiny fraction of voters -- more than 4.5 million people participated in the Tar Heel State in the 2012 presidential election. Democrats have returned 1,508 ballots, or 41%; Republicans 1,227 ballots, or 34%; and Independents 909 ballots, or 29%, as of Wednesday, according to the North Carolina state Board of Elections. In Iowa, more than 91,000 voters have asked for absentee ballots, according to the secretary of state's office. In all, 57% of those voters are registered Democrats, 22% are independents and 21% are Republicans. These are decent numbers for Clinton, but there is a significant drop-off from 2012. At this point, four years ago, more than 105,000 Democrats had requested absentee ballots. So far this year, only 51,663 Democrats have asked for ballots. The number for Republicans was almost the same both years. Democrats add voters in Florida, Colorado Democrats have seen their position improve in some key states when it comes to voter registration. Shifts in registration don't necessarily indicate which party is attracting new voters, because people switch parties, move to new states, and are removed from the rolls when they die. But these statistics contextualize the political landscape and are helpful data points in the big picture of electoral analysis. Democrats padded their existing registration edge in Florida, by adding almost 16,000 more voters to the rolls in the past month than Republicans did, according to the Florida Department of State. Their overall advantage in the state is about 274,000. It might seem like a nearly insurmountable a lead, but it isn't. President Barack Obama had an even larger advantage in 2012, but he only carried the Sunshine State that year by about 74,000 votes. Out west, in Colorado, Democrats have nearly erased what was once a formidable Republican registration advantage. They outpaced Republicans by about 9,000 voters in the past month, according to new data from the Colorado Secretary of State. That means the Republican registration advantage in Colorado is only about 2,600 right now. It was nearly 12,000 in August, and it was three times that size in November 2012, when Obama carried the state. Registration numbers have been stable in several other key swing states. That's good news for Democrats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada, where they have the advantage. And that's good news for the GOP in New Hampshire and Iowa, where there are more Republicans on the rolls. Currently, Democrats lead Republicans by about 919,000 registered voters in Pennsylvania, about 644,000 in North Carolina and about 71,000 in Nevada. Republicans lead Democrats by about 34,000 registered voters in Iowa and about 24,000 in New Hampshire. The voter rolls were very stable in both states in the past month. For example, the GOP edge in Iowa grew by only 175 votes since August. ",1,0,0
1405,"The attacks are here. They are not new and they are not going anywhere. They could be virtually for the most part eliminated from our shores, but that would take the leadership and a government body that was willing to go against the grain when other world leaders are in their weakness, condemning America for being ‘racists’ or ‘xenophobes’. Leadership that is willing to admit that what we have been doing up until now doesn’t work, in fact, it enables further attacks and further slaughter of American innocents. Leadership that wholeheartedly denies the erroneous communistic way of thinking known as Political Correctness.  None of these things will ever happen. They cannot happen. Not until the leaders of this nation stop weighing and measuring the quid-pro-quo way of doing business. Every day what is brought out on talk radio, on news networks, by Hollywood, is more feeling and thoughts of how to handle the day’s latest political crisis. The latest gag by Hillary Clinton or the recent back peddle by Donald Trump, and a large portion of America, the majority, is scratching their heads saying, “Are these the two best candidates in the entire nation?” Any hope of a better candidate swooping in and saving the day is a false hope. The truth is we did this to ourselves. We appoint our elected officials and they in turn make the decisions that we as a town, city, county, state and a nation have to deal with. One of those major decisions is how we combat terrorism. I say terrorism because we as a people can’t even come to the same conclusion that terrorism for a very long time has solely been perpetrated by Islamic fundamentalists. After this weekend’s attacks, America has been reminded that the war isn’t over. The war on our culture and way of life rages on, even if the tragedys are out of sight, out of mind. Senator Ted Cruz has released a statement that is dubbed ‘a clear-eyed’ approach to combating terrorism: “Terrorist attacks over the last several days across our homeland, from Manhattan to Minnesota, indicate we are moving into a new phase of the war against ISIS and al Qaida, who are increasingly targeting Europe and the United States. Two years ago, a focused, aggressive military campaign against ISIS’s claimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq might have effectively destroyed the terrorist group, but ISIS has instead spent the last year seeding radicals in the West, disguising jihadis as refugees and radicalizing Muslim citizens online and encouraging them to remain in the U.S. and fight here. Meanwhile, other networks such as al Qaida and the Taliban remain determined to resume the attacks on America that began on September 11, 2001. As we confront this new phase, we must avoid the trap of misconceiving these attacks as isolated incidents somehow disconnected from the larger ideological struggle against jihad. It is past time to take off the blinders and call the enemy what it is: radical Islamic terrorism engaged in a coordinated campaign designed to disrupt our very way of life. We must start by fully supporting our law enforcement community, from the heroic off-duty officer Jason Falconer, who neutralized the terrorist in the St. Cloud mall, saving many lives, to the FBI officers in New York who have worked swiftly to identify and apprehend the likely mastermind of the weekend bombings. We also desperately need the active participation of American Muslims who see the jihadis for what they are: the enemies of all who celebrate freedom and tolerance. Congress should act to prevent Americans who have traveled abroad for training from returning here, and to stop the flow of refugees from hotbeds of terrorism in the Middle East that President Obama is determined to bring to our country. We can’t overcome our enemies by pretending they don’t exist, and undermining our first line of defenders. Only together, clear-eyed and determined, can we defeat this foe.”   The first step is recognizing that we have a problem. Ted Cruz, as well as so many other patriots have. But none of this is going to have even a remote chance of coming to fruition if we as citizens continue to choose leaders that have proven themselves to be corrupt and unworthy stewards of this God-given nation.

837,"Trey Gowdy really gets it on the refugee resettlement crisis in this country. And he’s not buying Obama’s lame excuse of protecting widows and orphans. He’s more concerned with the American widows and orphans that will result because of terrorists being imported among these refugees. With no real vetting going on, it is a certainty. Obama is deliberately and willfully bringing in Jihadists to this country and seeding them all over the nation… especially in conservative strongholds. It is not Islamophobic to point out bringing in an Islamic invasion force per the Hijrah Migration is deadly to the US. The Refugee Act of 1980 requires a hearing in both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the Presidential ‘determination’ on the number of refugees the President is proposing for the upcoming fiscal year — in advance of the fiscal year. That hearing is due in one week and is extremely unlikely to take place. Obama is making an absolute joke of our laws and Constitution. He started out saying there would be 10,000 refugees. At the time I said it would be 250,000. Now he says it will be 110,000 and last week his minions claimed it would go to 217,000. I hate it when I’m right. From TellMeNow: Trey Gowdy is a champion for everyday Americans. While speaking about the Syrian refugee crisis, Gowdy offered a prosecutorial assessment of President Obama’s mishandling of the situation. Gowdy pointed out that the president shuts down any debate about this topic by slandering those concerned about national security. He likes to paint us as Islamophobic, but it is the president’s own staff that has raised red flags on this topic. This isn’t just about saving widows and orphans as Obama states. There are terrorists hiding among those widows and orphans. Gowdy summed up my position perfectly when he said, “What I’m really afraid of is a foreign policy that creates more widows and orphans.” Senator Jeff Sessions scheduled a hearing that the Obama State Department refused to attend over the refugee crisis. Gowdy is ringing some alarm bells here, but he has so far not scheduled any meetings to tackle the issue. Just a meeting to discuss how New Orleans became a Sanctuary City. 20,000 to 30,000 Syrian refugees are slated to arrive in the US next weekend… I think that matter is a bit more pressing at the moment. So, by all means… shred Obama on the refugee nightmare. But Gowdy should carry through and address the issue for real in the House. The only real thing on the calendar before these guys leave for the holidays is the budget continuation. Gowdy is exactly right that the refugees from Syria (and other Islamic countries) pose a horrific national security threat. But for God’s sake, let’s go after it for real before we truly do become an Islamic nation. This is why so many are turning to Donald Trump and voting for him. The more of this that goes down, the more likely Trump is to be the next Commander-in-Chief.  ",0,0,1
42,"In a bloody page in the journal purportedly found on Ahmad Rahami when he was captured, the New York and New Jersey bombing suspect appears to praise major terrorist figures, including the main spokesman for ISIS. A reference to ""Brother Adnani,"" presumably referring to the late Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, is the first public evidence that ISIS, as well as al-Qaeda, may have inspired Rahami's alleged violent acts. ""I looked for guidance and [praise be to God] guidance came. Sheikh Anwar[,] Brother Adnani ... said it clearly attack the kuffar [unbelievers] in their backyard,"" the page says. ""Sheikh Anwar"" is likely a reference to influential American-born al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike five years ago.       Elsewhere in the journal, Rahami purportedly praised al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden and 2009 Fort Hood shooter Nadal Hasan, according to a criminal complaint filed against Rahami late Tuesday, which doesn't mention al-Adnani. The Pentagon said al-Adnani was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Syria in late August. Before his death, he served as the primary spokesman for ISIS and often encouraged Western Muslims to conduct attacks in their home countries. ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European ... then rely on Allah and kill them in any manner or way, however it may be,"" Adnani said in an audio message two years ago. ISIS has not released any claim of responsibility for the bombings in New York, where 31 people were injured, and New Jersey, where no one was hurt.",1,0,0
1420,"CNN recently ran an article titled, “Donald Trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs.” Now, let’s first ignore the fact that once again, CNN is more upset over how we talk about the terror suspect and his religious affiliation than the fact that he allegedly set off bombs intended to hurt people and shot at cops during his capture. CNN claims Trump “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland.” Translation: Donald Trump is a RAAAAAAACIST!  But here’s the thing. Trump never even mentioned racial profiling. He was praising Israel’s extraordinary vetting methods, which involves profiling, especially at the airport. And guess what? It works for them. “Our police are amazing. Our local police — they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things,” Trump said. “You know, in Israel they profile. They’ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do. But Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they’ll profile. They see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile. They will take that person and they’ll check out,” he continued. “Do we have a choice? Look what’s going on. Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country. And this is only going to get worse.” Profiling doesn’t necessarily mean racial profiling. CNN completely made that up, because they want to advance the false narrative that Trump’s a giant racist. CNN even admitted that Trump didn’t actually say “racial” profiling in that very article. Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but it’s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status. So Trump “did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects,” but in the VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH, CNN definitively claims that he “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police.” They made a claim and basically debunked it two paragraphs later.

1196,"Hillary Clinton called on authorities in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Friday to release the police video showing shooting of Keith Scott ""without delay."" The former of secretary of state, who made reforming the criminal justice system an early centerpiece of her campaign, wrote that ""we must ensure justice & work to bridge divides."" The post was signed with her initial, H, indicating that the post was written personally by Clinton. Story Continued Below Cell phone video showing the shooting released Friday by NBC News and The New York Times does not conclusively show whether the victim was armed when police officers shot him. The video, recorded by Scott’s wife Rakeyia Scott, does not show him being shot although the sound of gunshots is audible. Keith Scott is not clearly visible in the video until after he has been shot, when officers surround his body lying on the pavement. Charlotte police said Keith Scott was holding a gun when officers shot him outside of his apartment on Tuesday. In the video, released by the victim’s family, police officers are heard yelling at Keith Scott to “drop the gun” while his wife shouts “he has no weapon” and “he has no gun.” Attorneys for the family have said that Keith Scott was not holding a gun when he was shot, although police have said they recovered a firearm and photos from the scene appear to show one lying next to the victim’s body. The video offers a different perspective from the dashboard camera and body camera footage that also captured the shooting but has not yet been released. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that he did not plan to release his department’s video of the shooting, although he has allowed the victim’s family and attorneys to view it. Keith Scott’s shooting by police, along with that of another black man, Terence Crutcher, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has prompted demonstrations nationwide. In Charlotte, those protests grew violent Wednesday night into Thursday morning, prompting North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency.

239,"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN)Hillary Clinton -- facing a dramatically tightening race and a troubling lack of enthusiasm -- is looking to this steadily changing state as an opportunity to stabilize her path to the White House and force Republicans to play offense. Clinton's challenge: Rebuilding Obama's winning coalition A sign of how seriously the Democratic nominee is taking North Carolina: it's the first place she visited last week when she returned to the campaign trail following a bout with pneumonia. President Barack Obama traveled to Charlotte this summer for his first campaign appearance with Clinton and is expected to return to the state repeatedly in October. The focus on North Carolina -- a state President Barack Obama carried narrowly in 2008 but lost four years later -- comes as polls show Clinton faltering in other battlegrounds such as Florida and Ohio. A win here would almost certainly offset losses in those states and guarantee her the presidency. And the raging culture war over LGBT rights playing out in the state offers her an opportunity to appeal to progressives and encourage them to show up on Election Day. Clinton has reason for some cautious optimism. A Quinnipiac poll released September 8 shows Clinton with a 4-point lead, just outside the margin of error. ""It's a coin toss,"" said J. Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College. ""We are dealing with a 45/45 split. The electorate is baked, the remaining 10% are folks who will decide at the last minute, and say 'I can't stand either one.' We are in a holding pattern unless something monumental happens."" Why Democrats are anxious Republican nominee Donald Trump is fighting hard for the state. He held a rally last week in Asheville and will be back in North Carolina Tuesday. But the election is playing out as the state is grappling with the fallout from House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill that requires people to use the bathroom of their biological gender. It also bans municipalities from passing rules barring discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Since the legislation's passage earlier this year, North Carolina -- with a long reputation as being one of the more progressive southern states -- has seen a blow to its image. The NBA, NCAA, and ACC have pulled major sporting events out of the state, resulting in millions in lost revenues, a substantial economic and cultural blow to a sport-crazy state. State politics upended And the state's politics have been upended. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory is lagging his Democratic challenger and GOP Sen. Richard Burr is in an unexpectedly competitive re-election race. Democrats see the issue as a rallying call to engage the Obama coalition and possibly, moderate Republicans. ""I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen,"" Clinton said at her Greensboro rally. ""And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina."" But Carter Wren, a Republican strategist doubts that House Bill 2 or McCrory's standing, will determine the presidential race here. ""The polling stuff I have seen on HB2, it didn't cut, everybody had an opinion, but it didn't change how people vote,"" he said. ""It's all about Hillary and Trump and mostly about character, that's what people are questioning more than the issues."" Kaine splits with Clinton on some Trump supporters as 'irredeemable' And Clinton is facing the same trouble here that she is nationwide: ginning up enthusiasm -- especially among young voters -- that she'll need to replicate Obama's winning coalition. Even voters here who are enthused by Clinton's candidacy recognize that others aren't that plugged into the race. ""Some of my friends are on the fence. They say Trump is horrible, but they are not sure about Clinton,"" said Cydnee Mebane, 19, who saw Clinton speak in Greensboro. ""They say they won't vote or they will vote for a third party. With my generation, we are either apathetic or too smart for our own good."" Daisy Goodwin, 65, was initially for Clinton during the primaries in 2008, but flipped to Obama. She expressed fear over what a Trump presidency would look like, and frustration that during voter registration drives, ""a lot of people said they aren't going to vote."" 'Where is Oprah?' ""She should bring Barack and Michelle. That will turn people out and we have to go door-to-door,"" said Goodwin, a retired beautician from High Point. ""And where is Oprah?"" Another challenge for Democrats is broadening their appeal among white voters, who have been increasingly voting less Democratic in Southern states, a trend that can't be entirely offset by gains with other demographic groups. While the African American vote remained steady from 2008 to 2012, a notable share of white voters shifted from Obama -- he won 31% of the white vote in 2012, down from 35% in 2008 according to exit polls. Obama: Would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back Clinton Still, Trump has clear vulnerabilities. ""If I am Trump, my problem is with undecided voters who supported [Mitt] Romney,"" Wren said. ""There are a fair amount of those people who voted for Romney, don't like Clinton but don't like Trump."" That's especially true in North Carolina, a state with an influx of new residents drawn to a tech boom in cities like Charlotte and Raleigh. The population growth has swelled the ranks of unaffiliated and more educated voters. Clinton and her allies have flooded the airwaves with millions in ads, targeting veterans, black millennials, suburban white voters and black churchgoers. Nearly $13 million in TV ads have been reserved through November. Priorities USA launched a $400,000 digital ad buy on Facebook, Instagram and Pandora with one ad called ""Most Racist Person,"" where Trump falsely claims that Obama is not an American citizen. This past Saturday, Democratic volunteers from around the state gathered at different campaign offices to get pep talks before they fanned out to register new voters. Democrats have boasted about their superior ground game, rattling off number of offices (33), paid staff (300) and volunteers (thousands). Republicans counter that buildings don't vote. ""Office numbers are a false metric and completely miss the point that, as we saw in the primary, Mr. Trump is not a typical politician and attempts to measure the strength of his campaign by old world comparisons like these fail to reflect the enthusiasm and grass-roots support seen by the thousands of supporters and new voters he is attracting to his events and his campaign,"" said Jason Simmons, Trump's North Carolina state director. Ultimately, the biggest question for Clinton is whether she can pull off the coalition that united behind Obama in 2008. He won at the time by orchestrating one of the most sophisticated and granular mobilization efforts the state has ever seen. Buoyed by a jump in the registration and participation of black and younger voters, the Obama campaign flipped a 13-point Democratic defeat in 2004, to a 14,000-vote win just four years later. On Monday and Tuesday, the Mothers of the Movement -- women who have lost their children to gun violence or at the hands of the police -- will stump for Clinton here. ""It was a very strong effort to reach the young people, you have a huge HBCU population down there and we had a very well-organized church strategy,"" said Rick C. Wade, who was Obama's national black vote director in 2008. ""It was the inspiration that Obama represented and I think that's the challenge. How do you get Hillary to connect with those folks?""

903,"During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports: One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost. Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it. The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect. Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find. Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head. Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President. See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here: Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people. Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition: A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.",0,1,0
325,"Atlanta (CNN)Rev. Raphael Warnock crouched forward in a back pew here at Ebenezer Baptist Church and wondered what could have been. ""I'm not afraid of Johnny Isakson,"" said Warnock of his Republican senator, at times distracted by the decades-old, muffled recordings of Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermons that echoed in this historic sanctuary. ""I'm not interested in a symbolic candidacy. I would've run to win."" A few hours later, the Democrat who is challenging Isakson instead of him, Jim Barksdale, tried to evince that same optimism speaking to a group of supporters at a Tex-Mex restaurant in Gwinnett County. ""This is a winnable election. Don't let anyone tell you anything else,"" said Barksdale, a 63-year-old soft-spoken investment manager and political newcomer. ""I wouldn't be in it if I didn't think it was winnable."" Barksdale, however, trails Isakson by 16 points in a Monmouth University poll released Monday, even though Donald Trump is up only 3 points ahead of Hillary Clinton. Georgia is looking increasingly like a missed opportunity for Democrats trying to win back the Senate -- and many fault Barksdale himself. ""We were giving a godsend, I believe, with Donald Trump,"" said Barksdale supporter Leonard Ware as he waited for the candidate to speak in Gwinnett. ""If we had a stronger candidate, we could've taken that Senate seat."" Georgia poll: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton in tight race For national Democrats, Barksdale's disappointing bid is part of a broader trend facing the party that came into 2016 with a favorable map of Senate races. In Ohio, Ted Strickland has been hampered by repeated gaffes and fundraising woes that have led national Democrats to essentially abandon a once-top candidate in the homestretch. Democrats have begun to make similar moves in Florida, where Patrick Murphy -- once a young, impressive recruit poised to flip a GOP seat -- has suffered dearly for embellishing his background and given Republican opposition researchers a trove of material. And here in Georgia, a half-dozen prominent Democrats passed on challenging Isakson, a decision that some in the party now rue. Even with the tight presidential race, Barksdale isn't trying to capitalize on any anti-Trump sentiment in Georgia. He didn't mention the GOP presidential candidate when meeting supporters campaigning Friday and barely addressed it until CNN asked him about the top of the ticket in an interview. That's a far cry from the Democratic playbook that has proved to be moderately successful in other Senate races. Democrats have tortured GOP incumbents like Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Richard Burr in North Carolina for their embrace of the nominee, and the poll numbers show it. Part of his reticence is that Barksdale, a former Bernie Sanders-backer, says he believes there are issues where he agrees with Trump. And he predicted a slew of Barksdale-Trump voters this November. ""It's hard to imagine how somebody can pull the lever for Donald Trump on the Republican side -- who is so anti-the-establishment and anti-the-trade-things -- and then pull the lever for Johnny Isakson,"" Barksdale said. African-American gap Georgia Democrats have long seen their political viability as resting on the state's booming minority population, and Barksdale's campaign agrees. If he can consolidate the black vote and win 85% of the community's 2.1 million voters, Barksdale aides say, he can win. The problem, revealed in a walk along this city's historically African-American Sweet Auburn neighborhood: People don't know who he is. ""Black dude?"" asked Paul Jones, a registered Democrat sitting on a ledge outside an abandoned park here, asked about the white Barksdale. ""Oh, no, I don't know him."" Some here do know Isakson, and he is a revered figure in some pockets of Georgia's middle class. At a major Republican call center in Isakson's home base of Cobb County last week, nearly everyone calling on his behalf have some personal relationship with the two-term senator -- whether they teach his granddaughter at Sunday school or write to his personal email every few weeks. And a trio of prominent Democrats, former US Sen. Sam Nunn, former Gov. Roy Barnes, and current US Rep. David Scott have all publicly backed Isakson, snubbing their own nominee. Despite Trump's struggles -- especially among independent women in the suburbs -- Isakson's team is calm and confident, thanks primarily to the caliber of the man they are facing. Their main concern is how much Barksdale himself plans to invest his campaign. He has invested $3 million so far, and he declined repeated questions about how high that total would go. ""No question that our Democratic friends are kicking themselves, given how volatile the electorate has become, for not having recruited a candidate with a higher profile with a better set of policies and messages,"" said Heath Garrett, Isakson's chief strategist said at their campaign office. ""The flip is -- they have a candidate that's willing to write a check,"" added campaign manager Trey Kilpatrick. Man in the hat Aside from not going after Trump, Barksdale has had other missteps that have cost him. The list of grievances among Georgians against Barksdale is long: the time conservative radio ridiculed him for misspelling 'judgment' on his campaign website; his sparse public event and interview schedule, stripping him of needed exposure; and his inability to effectively consolidate the Democratic base. Barksdale is further to the left than the centrist Senate bid waged by Michelle Nunn in 2014, who was thought to be a good ideological fit for Georgia despite being walloped in an open-seat contest. His calling card -- the cotton Bailey flat caps that he wears each day -- has drawn criticism as well from Georgia power brokers. ""I get a lot of compliments on it,"" he said. ""Everybody was worried that it wouldn't appeal within the, let's call it, minority communities -- but it really does."" The cap has emerged as the signature emblem of Barksdale's laggard campaign, with one soft-focus television ad featuring Georgians securing his cap over their hair (""Could I give you a good look here?"" he told one grade-schooler here before revealing his balding head.) His office in littered in cap imagery, with supporters imploring Republicans to ""send the hat"" -- not Barksdale, or as some call him more forgivingly, ""the man in the hat"" -- to the Senate. National Republicans don't send trackers to his events and have barely advertised against him as well. Republicans concede that Isakson would have faced a stronger test if Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed, or rising star state Rep. Stacey Abrams, or presidential scion Jason Carter, had not so strongly resisted overtures from party leadership to run a race seen as winnable. ""I had conversations with folks who were thoughtful about their request, and I was speedy in my response,"" said Abrams as she awaited a flight. ""I was very unequivocal about the fact that I had no interest in running for the Senate."" ""I thought seriously about it and I came this close to running,"" said Warnock, who said he wanted to remain at his church. ""This was not my time."" Several Democrats pointed to trends that explained Democrats' candidate problems nationally -- poor showings in 2014 sapped ambition from some red-state hopefuls, while others made their decisions well before Trump's struggles. Democrats did not land their first-choice recruit in North Carolina, and others have not lived up to the hype that came with their entrances into the race. ""When you look at states like North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana -- which were places that no one thought were going to be competitive this time last year -- I think it speaks to the quality of the candidates that came forward,"" said DSCC spokesman Lauren Passalacqua, who would only characterize Georgia as ""another area that we think is competitive in a year when Republican have struggled."" Isakson, for his part, takes some credit for the Democrats' A-team declining to challenge him. ""I've made a lot of friends. And I try to represent all the people when I'm in office,"" he said in an interview. ""I'm grateful they decided to stay where their careers were."" Run-off in January? The biggest challenge for Isakson at this point is getting to 50% -- the number he needs to avoid a run-off in January. The Monmouth poll has him at exactly that mark -- with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. Isakson aides predict a runoff would cost each side more than $20 million, and it could become a national spectacle should control of the Senate hang in the balance. ""If Johnny gets into a general election runoff, there will be money from all over the country that's going to pour into Georgia,"" said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Republican fundraiser and power player here in the state. ""If Hillary Clinton were to win the White House, does she come down here to campaign for Barksdale?"" But that may be the Democrats' best hope at this point. ""I was not the likeliest candidate,"" Barksdale said. ""If anyone else had gotten involved that I thought I was credible, I would've certainly let them carry the water instead of me."" ",1,0,0
341,"(CNN)It's becoming an election year tradition: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is hammering away at the Republican presidential nominee on his taxes. Reid took to the Senate floor Wednesday, taunting and ridiculing Donald Trump for not disclosing his tax returns. The reason for Trump's refusal is simple, Reid said. ""Because Trump's tax returns would further destroy his presidential candidacy,"" said Reid, who made Mitt Romney's tax returns a major election issue four years ago. Trump has insisted for months that he cannot release his tax returns because he is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service; alternatively, his campaign has said that voters do not much care about the issue. It is not a requirement for presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, but it is an enduring tradition. For the last 40 years, virtually every major party nominee has released his or her tax returns. (Gerald Ford released a summary in 1976.) Tax experts have said that an audit does not preclude Trump from releasing his returns. On Wednesday, Reid dismissed Trump's explanation, saying the real estate mogul is ""not known for caution or restraint."" ""He is the most unhinged and reckless presidential candidate ever,"" Reid said. Instead, Reid said the real reason for Trump's failure to disclose the returns is due to the political damage they would inflict on his campaign. ""Production of his tax returns would prove again that he is a fraud,"" Reid said. The retiring Nevada senator said the tax returns would show that Trump is ""not the billionaire he claims to be"" and a ""welfare king"" who is ""mooching off the American taxpayer."" Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment. It was the second time in as many days that Reid has torched Trump over his taxes. And it's become a familiar role for Reid, who excoriated Romney for refusing to release some of his tax returns in the 2012 presidential race. Romney released a 20-year summary of his tax liabilities from 1990 until 2009, as well as his tax returns from 2010 and 2011, but he did not release the returns from previous years. Reid, without proof, accused Romney of going a decade without paying federal income taxes. Four years later, Reid and Romney are now on the same side of the issue. In February, Romney speculated publicly that Trump's tax returns would reveal a ""bombshell."" Trump fired back on Twitter that month, claiming Romney ""didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R!"" On Wednesday -- four years to the day that Romney released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns -- Reid found himself with an unlikely ally. ""Mitt Romney and I agree on one thing, and that's one thing for sure,"" Reid said on the Senate floor. ""And that is that Donald Trump should release his tax returns."" ",1,0,0

473,"(CNN)Debate stages have long doubled as presidential burial grounds. With a few sharp lines, an acid quip, or just a well-timed nod, the candidates can do more to unravel their opponents than in a hundred speeches or television commercials. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have made no secret of their disdain for each another. But on Monday night, there will be no safety net and nowhere to hide -- just two people on stage and, as some analysts believe, 100 million more watching their every move. Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle Here are some of the most devastating lines in presidential debate history -- will Trump or Clinton need to be added to this list? Reagan rolls Carter The incumbent President Jimmy Carter wanted to talk about Ronald Reagan's work as governor of California. But Reagan had heard enough -- and bet that voters felt the same way. As Carter finished a long point with a comment on his opponent's ""typical"" positions, Reagan stepped in with four words: ""There you go again."" Obama mocks Mitt Mitt Romney had been hammering President Barack Obama for having downsized parts of the armed forces. But Obama turned it around on his 2012 challenger, mocking and painting him as out of touch with modern foreign policy questions. When Romney trounced Obama On the question of the smaller number of Naval ships, Obama said: ""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."" A killer joke In 1984, Reagan sent Republicans into a panic with a garbled opening debate performance against Walter Mondale. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders The Baltimore Sun's Henry Trewhitt asked if the President's age would keep him from being able to do the job. Here is Reagan's cheeky response, which Mondale would later describe as having effectively ended the race: ""Not at all. And, Mr. Trewhitt, I want you to know also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Lloyd Bentsen knew Jack Kennedy, then he owned Dan Quayle You can see it about 15 seconds into the clip. Vice presidential candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's brow shoots up as Dan Quayle, George H.W. Bush's 1988 running mate, answers a question about his relative inexperience, saying, ""I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency."" Bentsen fired back: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" Mondale buries the ""hatchet man"" Before he was a warmly remembered war hero who lost his own presidential race in a 1996 landslide to Bill Clinton, Bob Dole had a different kind of notoriety. During a 1976 vice presidential debate with Walter Mondale, he showed why. Asked if Watergate, and then President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon, were off-limits, Dole launched into a long rant essentially blaming ""Democrat wars"" for killing millions of Americans. Mondale hit back with one line: ""I think Sen. Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight."" Perot sets himself apart With his Texas twang, Ross Perot made a serious dent in the 1992 presidential race. Here he underlines why his lack of experience in government was going to be a political asset: ""I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done."" Lincoln prints and publishes his debate zingers Though the words were spoken during one of their celebrated 1858 Senate debates, Abraham Lincoln was so pleased with his performance against Stephen A. Douglas, he took the transcripts (which he edited, liberally, on his own) and published them in a book before their 1860 presidential rematch. In arguing that Douglas was using a flimsy principle as a bogus pretext for spreading slavery nationwide, Lincoln mockingly asked what remained of the substance of his rival's position: ""Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death?"" Gore questions (the first) Bush's resume Al Gore was running for vice president in 1992, but that didn't mean he wasn't aiming high. Here is the shot he took at George H.W. Bush, who had sought to attach his record to that of his former boss Reagan, during a three-way debate with Dan Quayle and Adm. James Stockdale: ""George Bush taking credit for the Berlin Wall coming down is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise."" Bush shakes off Gore Sometimes, words are unnecessary. At 11:58 in this clip, early on in his debate with Al Gore, George W. Bush responds to the vice president's ill-timed stroll and apparent attempt to intimidate him with a simple -- but devastating -- silent shake of his head. ",1,0,0
627,"“We love you, buddy, but what are you here for, if you can’t answer basic questions?” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, was destroyed on Morning Joe Wednesday morning because he tried to tap-dance around the most basic questions about his candidate’s stands on issues. Things started to go downhill about two and a half minutes into the interview when Willie Geist asked Mook if Clinton had regrets about the way Syria was handled. Completely ignoring the question, Mook’s response was that Hillary left the State Dept. with a 70% approval rating. GEIST: What’s her biggest regret about the way Syria’s been handled? MOOK: Well, obviously, she’s been out of office for some time now. GEIST: But she was there when it started. MOOK: Well, right, but, but, uh, you know, she, I, I think she’s well regarded for her leadership as secretary of state. She came out of that office with a 70 percent approval rating. In contrast to Donald Trump, she has released a clear and decisive plan to defeat ISIS. Donald Trump has said that he thinks he knows more about it than the generals and refuses to tell us what his secret plan is. GEIST: I understand, Robby. What about in Syria, though? She supported the drawing of the red line. Obviously, she was out of office when Assad used chemical weapons. Was it a mistake to draw the red line if the president was not willing to go — to do something about it when it was crossed? MOOK: Well, as you pointed out, the decision regarding that was made after she was out of office, so I think you’d have to ask President Obama — GEIST: Was she disappointed that the president didn’t act when the line was crossed?

274,"New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week -- hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election, but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all: Preparing for her first face-to-face confrontation with Donald Trump. While she is set to make a quick trip to Florida on Wednesday, after dipping into Pennsylvania on Monday, Clinton will devote the lion's share of her time huddling with her debate team, gaming out how she will confront Trump next Monday night at Hofstra University. The lead Clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated, raising the stakes for the first debate. The terrorism investigation in New York and New Jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with Trump, which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues. Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on ""The Daily DC"" podcast Clinton, who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history, faces a new challenge with Trump. She is preparing for Trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects, ranging from her email scandal to Bill Clinton's infidelity to her health. Trump showed he was willing to go there Tuesday when he tweeted, ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!"" Clinton, in a radio interview Tuesday, said she was ready to deal with Trump's attacks. ""I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent,"" Clinton said Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. ""I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I have been at this, I understand it is a contact sport."" Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle To knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest. Clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style. But Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton. Clinton told supporters at an August fundraiser that a friend told her: ""There will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time. So don't assume they have followed anything."" ""There will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night,"" Clinton said. A team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort, including Ron Klain, who advised Obama, and Karen Dunn, a long-time lawyer and aide. She is not setting up a formal ""debate camp,"" aides said, but intends to be secluded at her home in Chappaqua, New York, in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on Monday. Clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about Trump's policy, personality and politics, including receiving input from Tony Schwartz, who was the co-author for ""Art of the Deal,"" the best-seller about Trump. Expectations game Clinton aides worry that they can't lower expectations enough ahead of the event. ""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August. With her Senate contests in 2000 and 2006, along with more than two dozen debates with Barack Obama in 2008 and nine meetings with Bernie Sanders in this primary campaign, she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times. 2016 race tightens in Florida Trump will not be the first unconventional opponent Clinton has faced in a debate. Clinton all-but ended her 2000 Senate race against Rick Lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the Republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules. Lazio's bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and Clinton handily beat him by 12 points in November. Her debate last fall against four Democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions, including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the Democratic Party. ""I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done,"" Clinton said, rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning. Clinton's performances have not been without missteps, however. The former senator from New York cited the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to Wall Street, a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacking her on the issue. Which Trump will show up? In the last few weeks, as Clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message, the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks. Clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about Clinton's debate process, preferring not to telegraph to the Trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate. When asked about the debates, Clinton has tried to laud Trump's debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at Hofstra. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders ""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points."" ",1,0,0
1484,"I love Texas! I mean I really love their attitude. They are like the honey badger, they just don’t give a damn about what everyone else thinks. Governor Abbott is the quintessential Texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state EVEN if it means spitting in the face of Barack Obama.   Governor Abbott told Obama on Wednesday that Texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns. Abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the United States. Abbott doesn’t want to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals. The Texas State Refugee Coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw. The Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement its services to help integrate newcomers into U.S. society are only provided after they complete stringent US security screenings. Currently the US Refugee Settlement Processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the US. “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” “While many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston,” Abbott said. “Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people,” he added. “Therefore, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives.” So take THAT Mr. President!   ",0,0,1
1465,"Target garnered intense criticism for a Christmas sweater that seemingly mocked people who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. The store received backlash from customers who felt the sweater, which had the phrase “Obsessive Christmas Disorder” written on the front, belittled and mocked a serious mental disorder.  “As someone with OCD I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t sell my illness as a fashion statement,” Twitter user Reign Murphy tweeted alongside a photo of her holding up the sweater.   Others reacted similarly to the controversy, with several blasting the retail giant for mocking a “serious mental illness.” ""Today at Target I saw a sweater that said 'OCD Obsessive Christmas Disorder'…why is trivializing a mental disorder so widely accepted?” one tweet about the sweater read. Target ultimately responded to the backlash with an apology, but stopped short of removing the item from its stores. “We never want to disappoint our guests and we apologize for any discomfort. We currently do not have plans to remove this sweater,” spokesman Josh Thomas said in the statement.  Target was previously the center of similar controversy regarding a sign that referenced “building sets” and “girls’ building sets” for sale. It was also criticized for selling a women's T-shirt with the word “Trophy” on the front, which inspired a successful petition for its removal. “The truth is that millions of women and young girls are taken as ‘trophies’ every year in war, sex trafficking, slavery, and rape,” the petition said, Fortune reported. “Labeling any person as a ‘Trophy’ is demeaning their humanity and objectifying them as a tangible object that can be bought, used, and disposed of.” Target responded to that controversy by apologizing for offending customers. “It is never our intention to offend anyone,” the company’s statement read. “These shirts are intended as a fun wink and we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests.” Sources: USA Today, Fortune / Photo credit: Reign Murphy/Twitter via Spectacular Photo Wonders ",0,0,1
1418,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries. From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

1188,"Colleges and universities that don't spend their endowments to directly benefit students should lose the tax breaks on those endowments, Donald Trump said Thursday night. Echoing House Republicans who have questioned why wealthy universities with fat endowments keep raising tuition prices, Trump said during a rally in Chester Township, Pa., that it's time for colleges to spend their endowments to help students — rather than on ""other things that don’t matter.” Story Continued Below Trump said too many colleges use the money they have to pay for administrators, equity fund managers and to put donors' names on buildings. ""What a lot of people don’t know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments,"" Trump said. ""These huge, multi-billion-dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don’t use the money to help with the tuition and student debt.” Trump said he would work with Congress to push reforms to help students and families, so that colleges make ""good faith"" efforts to curtail student debt. The GOP presidential nominee said paying for college is one of the top issues he hears about from voters. Going to college, Trump said, “should be easier to access, pay for and finish, and a lot of people want to do that.” ""We have to deal with these universities,"" Trump told the crowd. ""We have to break the cycle.""",1,0,0
859,"The story of how a group of black clubgoers were turned away at the door of a club is going viral. Ashley Ellis Sisco and a group of friends attempted to visit the Kandy Bar in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were turned away at the door and told they needed a membership to get in, but a group of white girls behind them told them that wasn’t the case. The bouncers, clearly racially profiling, allowed the white girls to enter while Sisco filmed them turning away a black man with dreads. Sisco later posted in the comments that “the sad thing is that we all work in public service. It was a group of nurses, teachers, bankers people who serve the community and work with every race and ethnicity without judgement….and we have to go back into the community we serve and be treated like trash.” It is clear that in North Carolina, a state where support for the Confederacy still is very strong, racism is still a major part of their identity, and this kind of display of casual racism makes it clear how Donald Trump is so popular in this country.

41,"The latest national presidential poll has some encouraging news for the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, showing a 6-point lead for her over Republican candidate Donald Trump. Clinton received 43 percent support from likely voters in the poll, from NBC and The Wall Street Journal, compared with Trump's 37 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson maintained his third position with 9 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein trailed with 3 percent. In a head-to-head matchup, Clinton's lead expands to 7 points over Trump, 48 to 41. The margin of error of the poll is 3.2 percentage points. After the Democratic National Convention in July, polls showed Clinton's lead over Trump ballooning to upward of 10 points in early August before returning to tighter margins in recent weeks. Surveys by Fox News and CBS/New York Times last week showed a spread between the two candidates within the polls' margin of error.     Today's numbers give Clinton her largest margin since Aug. 31, when a Fox News poll gave her a 6-point edge. Clinton received more support than usual from registered male voters in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Trump maintained higher levels of backing from the demographic, garnering 46 percent support to Clinton's 44 percent, but the difference is much narrower than in earlier polls. In additional questions, respondents expressed concern about Trump's words and actions on the campaign trail, with 69 percent of those surveyed reporting that they have reservations about aspects of his campaign, with 54 percent saying they have ""major"" concerns. Specifically, 33 percent of likely voters reported dismay over Trump's temperament; 27 percent said his comments about women, immigrants and Muslims worry them the most; and 13 percent were most disturbed by his compliments for Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Democratic side, Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state continued to bother voters; 64 percent expressed concern about the issue.

927,"Republican nominee Donald Trump got thoroughly outplayed by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the debate tonight, only capable of blustering and babbling in response to her cool and measured fact-based statements. Whether it was crime, national security, the economy, trade, or his own tax returns, Trump was on the defensive the entire night, unable to overcome the consequences of his own selfish decisions and the weaknesses of the incoherent rambles that pass for policy positions for the Republican nominee. Immediately after the debate, Trump rolled out a pathetic excuse for his own failures tonight.  Trump is relentlessly sticking to this ridiculous notion that the system is “rigged” against him, refusing to admit that he’s shot himself in the foot so many times that the vast majority of the American people will be unwilling to support a rabble-rousing racist with an extensive history of shady business practices. Not only is it a shameful refusal to admit his own mistakes, but it’s an existential attack on our entire democracy. His mic was clearly not defective, since he continuously interrupted both moderator Lester Holt and Secretary Clinton tonight and didn’t back down off from failed attempts to take cheap shots at the Democratic nominee. His childish behavior tonight illustrates that he is temperamentally unfit to be the President of the United States, and this pitiful response is just the cherry on the cake.",0,1,0
220,"Anyone watching Monday nightâs highly charged presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump knows that Hillary cleaned Trumpâs clock. Of course, Trumpâs ego will never let him admit that he lost to Hillary, so his surrogates are already being deployed all over the place to spin his embarrassingly terrible debate performance into something positive. The verbal gymnastics there are astounding, but of course these people are Donald Trump surrogates, so they are used to spinning faster than the head of the girl in The Exorcist. One Trump surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, is taking things a step further, though, and trying to float the idea that Trump should refuse to do future debates with Hillary. Of course, this is just a cowardly move because of Trumpâs abysmal performance. But Giuliani is the Trump Spinner-in-Chief, and instead decided to blame the fact that NBC moderator Lester Holt actually called Trump out on his lies on his suggestion that Trump should skip out next time. Giuliani whined that Holtâs fact-checking was unfair treatment of Trump, and therefore if it were him, he wouldnât debate again without certain petty, childish demands being met: âIf I were Donald Trump, I wouldnât participate in another debate unless I was promised the journalist would act like a journalist, and not an ignorant fact check.Â My advice would be the moderator would have to promise theyâd be a moderator.â When pressed, Giuliani refused to say whether or not he would advise Trump to find a way out of debating Hillary again, only that if it were him, it is what he would do. This is in direct contrast with Trumpâs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who insists Trump will do both future debates. While both candidates had nothing but good things to say about Holtâs moderation, Giuliani lit into Holt regarding the stop and frisk question, saying that the moderatorâs âinterferenceâregarding the controversial policy and its effects on New York City was âoutrageous.â However, considering that Trump has floated the idea of a nationwide stop and frisk policy, the discussion on that subject and its racist implementation was perfectly reasonable. That didnât stop Giuliani from outright lying in his rant, though, when he said: âIf journalism has ethics, Lester Holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about.Â It is not unconstitutional and Trumpâs description of that case was correct.â But, again, this is a lie â a federal judge definitely ruled the policy unconstitutional. At the end of the day, Giulianiâs tantrum is only because he wants his candidate to be able to lie with impunity in front of millions, because most Trump voters are low information plebes, or they simply donât care about Trumpâs bigotry, lies, incompetence, and just general all-around douchebaggery. However, if he gets called out on a debate stage, it makes him look like a fool to undecided voters, who are much more likely to vote for Hillary if they are going to leave third-party camps. If Trump drops out of future debates, he and his surrogates will blame Lester Holt, the so-called âliberalâ media, and anyone and anything besides Trump himself. Rudy Giuliani is just laying the groundwork for that right now. ",0,1,0
1544,"There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.   While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces. A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:   Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think? And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.   Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

979,"KENT, OHIO—A lonely Hillary supporter stood with a sign outside the rec center at Kent State University on Saturday, a gray and muggy afternoon for a rally. “INSECURE, SMALL PENISED WHITE GUYS FOR TRUMP!!!” his sign read. Near him, grizzled men in fatigues and sunglasses and a fraternity brother held pro-Trump signs. But the main swirl of activity ahead of Bernie Sanders’ speech in this Ohio college town was the dozen fervent Jill Stein supporters, formerly fervent Bernie supporters, holding signs and signing up volunteers. “We have a better choice,” one sign—puffy paint on rumpled printer paper—said. “The two-party system is messed uuuup!” sang Patty Friedrich, a local Green Party organizer, as she pranced around, handing out fliers to people going to the rally. “Embrace the suuuuuck!” Story Continued Below “I think our democracy is over after this election,” said Kristyn Nye, who works in marketing. “It doesn’t matter who wins.” Bernie had opened her eyes, she said, and when he left the race, she was bereft of choice and angered by his speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. “He should’ve just dropped the mic,” Nye said. “I wish he would’ve just stuck it to them. What does he have to lose? People in Vermont love him!” After a rally in Akron, Bernie Sanders had arrived in Kent on a mission that might be critical to the election: coaxing disaffected Ohioans not just to vote, but to vote for the woman whom he’d been calling corrupt just a few months ago. With Donald Trump moving up in the polls—and even, according to some polls, leading in this crucial swing state—the Clinton campaign sent in the reinforcements: Bernie Sanders. Hillary for America, which organized the event, was evidently hoping that Sanders, with his anti-establishment appeal and image of fiery authenticity, could bring his herd—and maybe a few stragglers—more securely into the fold. But it was not clear how well it was working: Nye had internalized Bernie’s message so fully that she had decided to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. She was for Jill mostly because she disliked Hillary, who voted for the war in Iraq, is constantly surrounded by scandal and, in Nye’s view, “doesn’t stand for anything.” She also may or may not have Parkinson’s. “But I know a person with Parkinson’s, and I don’t know how she would be able to control the shakes,” Nye muses out loud. “She would have to be on so many drugs that she’d be so out of it, but she seems sharp. How does she do it?” Maybe she just doesn’t have Parkinson’s? I offered. Nye blinked at me, not understanding. “She’s just so untrustworthy, that I just don’t know,” she finally responded. “Is it pneumonia?” And another thing, Nye said. Clinton wants to start a war with Russia, which she heard on Russia Today. When I pointed out that this was a channel paid for exclusively by the Kremlin, she wondered how that was any different from, say, NPR. She wasn’t going to the rally inside the rec center to hear Bernie speak, and neither were the other Bernie diehards there that day. “Why? To hear a man who sold his soul?” said Michele Bline, 54, a disabled veteran of Desert Storm. “Bernie sold ooouuuut!” sang Friedrich nearby. “They threatened his familyyy!” “We’ve heard it all before,” Bline went on. “We know where he stands,” “He’s not going to sway me,” a grad student named Gwen West chimed in. Inside, past the humming treadmills and clanging weights, on the far edge of the basketball courts, walled off from the dribblers and dunkers by a wall of semi-transparent white netting, Sanders stood slouching over the lectern, his rumpled pants falling on clunky black shoes, holding forth to a crowd of about 300. A Sanders rally of yore this was not. Earlier that day in Akron, only about 150 came out to hear the old prophet of political revolution. Here, he tried to fulfill his promise to do whatever he could to prevent Trump from being president. To cheers and finger snaps, he talked about the man’s bigotry and “the so-called Bertha movement.” “Now let me be very clear about what the Bertha movement really is,” he went on in his Brooklyn accent about the faux controversy Trump spawned about Obama’s provenance. “It’s not about disagreeing with Obama—you can disagree any time you want. What they were trying to do, led by Donald Trump, is to delegitimize the presidency of the first black president we have ever had. ... What an outrage! What a racist attack!” “This is an enormously, enormously, enormously important election,” he pressed on, the crowd beaming up at him. “And for those of your friends who say, ‘Well, I don’t like anybody, I’m not going to vote’ ... ask your friends why the Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars if this election is not important.” It took him a while to get around to saying it, but he did: “Hillary Clinton believes as I believe” that the minimum wage must be raised, that women should control their own bodies, that “our gay brothers and sisters have the right to get married.” “You have to do everything you can to make sure that Secretary Clinton and [Democratic Senate candidate] Ted Strickland win in this state!” Afterward, he was mobbed for handshakes and selfies. “Did you get to shake his hand?” Lorie Sewell, a local teacher, asked her husband Jim. “Twice!” Jim grinned. They had voted for Bernie in the primaries and were still fans, but, said Jim, who teaches at Kent State, “there was no convincing necessary” to get them to support Clinton. He went on, “We would’ve rather voted for Bernie, but the choice is pretty darn clear.” Three freshmen, Samantha, Quincy and Molly, were exhilarated by the various media interviews they had given after the rally, and their parents—it was parents’ weekend—waited patiently until they could get a bite to eat. The girls were all ardent Bernie supporters—and one of their dads was, too—but they liked Clinton fine, too. Their parents had supported her, and it was a natural switch for them. “I was always going to vote for Hillary if Bernie didn’t win,” Samantha said. Nearby, three young female students, two of them black, told me they had voted for Bernie but were willing to support Hillary in order to keep Trump from being elected—which, one of them laughed, would usher in “World War 17.” They weren’t huge fans of Hillary and her “sketchy” history, but they understood the stakes and Sanders’s lobbying for her was compelling. “Bernie’s supporting her,” Kelyanne, a junior, said, “so there must be a side of her that’s good that we just don’t see.” There was a small commotion in the wings—the student volunteers were meeting privately with Bernie, who thanked them for their support and took a group photo with them. Afterward, two of them, both College Democrats who had voted for Bernie in the primaries, gushed about that moment. “He had his hand on his shoulder!” Brian DiPaolo said, pointing to his comrade Anthony Erhardt. They still loved Bernie, but the switch hadn’t been wrenching for them either. “I was never a Bernie-or-Buster,” said Erhardt. “It was not hard” to watch Bernie concede in Philadelphia and pass the baton to Clinton. “It was a celebratory moment,” he said. There are still some things on which Erhardt disagreed with Clinton, but ultimately, he said, “the pros outweigh the cons.” “I’m voting for her because she’s more qualified,” DiPaolo said matter-of-factly, clearly proud of the maturity of his reasoning. “I like to say that we’re not selling out, we’re buying in.” Sure, they had some friends who were holding out and planning on sitting out the election—all the students I talked to did—and they just hadn’t bothered to even come see Bernie that afternoon. This struck them all as “selfish” and “self-centered” and the people outside, the Jill Stein supporters, are “just doing harm to Bernie’s image.” Or, as Erhardt put it, “I love Bernie, I still do. I just hate his supporters.”",1,0,0
983,"Donald Trump took full advantage of the opportunity Monday to return to blasting Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for failing to keep the country safe in the wake of this weekend's bomb attacks in New York City. And Clinton jumped on the news to prosecute her own case against Trump: that he is a dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory rhetoric puts the nation at further risk. The polls offer a more nuanced picture. Voters trust Clinton over Trump by a narrow margin when it comes to terrorism and national security — a reversal from past elections when Republicans were seen as the party stronger on national defense. But that’s not the end of the story: Trump’s supporters are far more concerned about terrorism than Clinton’s, suggesting the GOP nominee could appeal to voters who are increasingly anxious about safety at home. Story Continued Below The attacks this weekend present a new backdrop to the one-week run-up to the first general-election debate — a one-on-one showdown on national television between Clinton and Trump, held fewer than 30 miles from the scene of an explosion on the west side of Manhattan that wounded more than two dozen people on Saturday evening. Both candidates on Monday sought to reinforce their credentials on terrorism and spin it into an advantage. Clinton held a press conference at a suburban New York airport before traveling to Philadelphia, calling herself “the only candidate in this race who has been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield.” Trump, meanwhile, responded with a statement on Facebook, saying Clinton “has emboldened terrorists all over the world to attack the U.S., even on our own soil,” adding that terrorists “are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes [p]resident — so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” Overall, polls conducted prior to this weekend give the Democratic nominee a slim advantage on the issue. In last week’s Fox News poll, Clinton edged Trump among likely voters asked who would do a better job handling terrorism and national security, 47 percent to 46 percent. Among registered voters surveyed by CBS News/New York Times over a similar time period, 49 percent trusted Clinton more on national security and terrorism — which rated a close second to the economy and jobs on a list of most-important issues — compared to 45 percent for Trump. In a Quinnipiac University poll last week, 49 percent of likely voters said Clinton would do a better job “keeping the country safe from terrorism,” while 47 percent said Trump would do a better job. And in an ABC News/Washington Post poll this month, half of registered voters said they trust Clinton more to handle terrorism, more than the 41 percent who trust Trump — though that margin narrows to 48 percent for Clinton to 45 percent for Trump among likely voters. Clinton, multiple polls show, is viewed as having experience and as the better informed, more stable leader. In the Fox News poll, 61 percent of likely voters say the former secretary of state is “qualified to be president,” far more than the 45 percent who say Trump is qualified. Fifty-nine percent think Clinton “has the temperament to serve effectively as president,” compared to only 38 percent who say Trump is temperamentally fit. But voters also see Trump as a decisive candidate who will tell it like it is and is more committed to attacking the Islamic State in the Middle East. In a slightly older CNN/ORC International poll, conducted over the first four days of this month, half of voters said the phrase “a strong and decisive leader” applied more to Trump than the 42 percent who said it applied to Clinton. (That poll, the only live-caller national poll Trump has led since the conventions, also found Trump ahead on the issue of terrorism, 51 percent to 45 percent. Clinton’s slight edge on terrorism and national security in most polls reverses what was a traditional Republican advantage. For decades, voters have seen the GOP and its presidential nominees as stronger on defense. As an incumbent in 2004, then-President George W. Bush enjoyed a sizable advantage on terrorism over then-Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). A CBS News/New York Times poll in early October of that year found more voters had confidence that Bush (52 percent) would make the right decisions when it came to protecting against a terrorist attack than had confidence in Kerry (39 percent). Barack Obama faced a similar gap in the 2008 campaign against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was lauded as a Vietnam War hero and has focused on defense issues during his time in the Senate. Voters throughout the campaign trusted McCain over Obama on terrorism, according to ABC News/Washington Post polls, though the gap between the two candidates narrowed toward Election Day. In 2012, Obama, with the benefit of incumbency and the killing of Osama bin Laden the year before, grabbed the advantage that year over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Obama was generally more trusted on foreign policy, according to data from the Pew Research Center, and exit polls showed more voters trusted Obama to handle an international crisis than Romney. But even though more voters, on average, trust Clinton over Trump on terrorism, rising unease about more attacks could benefit the Republican. Prior to this weekend, Trump voters were far more concerned about terrorism: In last week’s Quinnipiac University poll, a combined 79 percent of likely voters said it was “very” or “somewhat” likely that there would be a terrorist attack in the U.S. “in the near future … causing large numbers of lives to be lost.” (No one was killed in this weekend’s incidents.) Virtually all of Trump’s supporters, 96 percent, said it was at least “somewhat likely” there would be an attack in the near future, including a 57-percent majority who said it’s “very likely.” But just 64 percent of Clinton backers said it was likely, and only 19 percent said it was “very likely.” That anxiety extends to voters’ own lives. A combined 47 percent of likely voters said they are at least “somewhat concerned” that they or someone in their family “will be the victim of a terrorist attack” — with, again, a sharp break by the presidential candidate they support. More than two-thirds of Trump’s voters, 68 percent, said they were at least “somewhat concerned” about being the victim or someone in their family being the victim of a terrorist attack — while only 29 percent of Clinton supporters were concerned about it. This has also been a traditional Republican advantage: Voters most concerned about terrorism have tended to support the GOP ticket in large numbers. In 2008, McCain defeated Obama among the quarter of Americans who were “very worried” about a terrorist attack in the United States, 54 percent to 43 percent, according to the exit poll. But in the past two elections, terrorism hasn’t been a major issue for voters. In that 2008 exit poll, only 9 percent of voters said terrorism was the most important issue, and McCain won them overwhelmingly, 86 percent to 13 percent. The 2012 exit poll didn’t even ask voters about terrorism, though a September 2012 Pew survey found Romney voters (68 percent) were significantly more likely than Obama voters (55 percent) to say terrorism was “very important” to their vote. The last time terrorism was a significant factor in a presidential campaign, the Bush-Kerry race in 2004, 19 percent of voters in the exit poll rated it as their most important issue. Bush carried them by 72 points, 86 percent to 14 percent.",1,0,0
547,"Scroll down for video It’s often been said with some humor,that behind every conservative lies a liberal who was once mugged, and perhaps black activist Jerry Ford Jr. will become the latest robbery victim to join the ever-growing ranks. This latest incident took place on the campus at the University of Houston when grad student Ford a ‘Black Lives Matter” member and group leader was robbed at gun point, as he was about to enter his apartment. He describes walking by a young man apparently loitering next to his apartment complex, and thought nothing of it until he unlocked his door, and then the young thug sprung into action, pulling out a hand gun and demanding Ford’s wallet and cell phone, which of course Ford surrendered. Ironically Ford is running for Texas State Representative, while also a vocal activist and head of Houston Chapter of “Black Lives Matter”, which of course promotes the de-funding of many police programs around the country. And which of course made his comments after being robbed all the more ludicrous stating: “I hope they (the police), would take a bigger stance and put more security over here because you have a lot of people walking back and forth to class.” Ford also added that because the housing is off campus, it isn’t patrolled by university police security, which he would like to see it changed for the protection of the students…it would seem that a conservative by any other name, is a liberal once mugged. Then after this BLM ""activist"" actually had the nerve to actually ask for more protection from the police he comically had this to say about the thief, ""I would've gave him money,"" he said. ""I would've talked to him because the real crime is why is he in that position that he feels the need to come and hang out at a college campus and rob people of stuff they worked for."" Right.

1258,"LAKELAND, Fla. — In a bruising pre-debate series of attacks, Tim Kaine compared Donald Trump unfavorably to Richard Nixon, suggested Trump pays little in taxes and said Hillary Clinton will do “very well” as Trump struggles with the truth. About eight hours before Clinton and Trump take the stage in Hempstead, N.Y., Kaine predicted Trump will crumble when confronted with any questions that touch specific policy areas. Story Continued Below “You can run but you can’t hide. We’re going to see tonight: Can he give any details about anything? Can he answer questions like: where’s your tax return?” Kaine said, noting that presidents since Nixon have released their returns. “If you can’t be as ethical as Richard Nixon, folks, I mean come on.” At the airport in Lakeland, Kaine was greeted by Michael Phillips, a campaign volunteer with a disability who works on technology to allow people with disabilities to better communicate. Kaine read aloud a note from Phillips at a rally in this Central Florida town about an hour later, quoting Phillips as saying: “I’ve been waiting my entire life for a candidate like you and Secretary Clinton.” Kaine then held up a copy of Trump’s recent book, titled “Crippled America.” Phillips “has a severe disability. He said, ‘That’s not limiting me,’” Kaine recounted. “Donald Trump has a very different vision.” While Kaine repeated many familiar attacks on Trump as a poor steward of the military for his rhetoric aimed at the likes of Sen. John McCain and Khizr Khan, he also dinged Trump for promoting “stop and frisk” policies while tensions between police and black Americans persist in places like Charlotte and Minnesota, saying it would “widen the gap” between police and the community. Kaine spent most of his pre-debate comments on Trump and questioned his relationship with facts as a partisan argument rages over whether moderator Lester Holt should fact-check the debate. “Donald Trump thinks he can get this over on you,” Kaine said. “He’s got to answer the questions. And the last thing we get to see [at the debate] about Donald Trump is whether he can tell the truth.” Kaine did predict Clinton will do “very well” on Monday, a bit more cautious than his “A-plus” prediction at a rally Sunday night in the Miami area. And he said he’ll be doing his homework in preparation for the debate of his own in eight days in Farmville, Va. “I’m real interested in this debate. So I’m going to be on the edge of my seat taking notes,” he said. While Pence will be in New York to watch Trump, Kaine will attend a watch party that will include former Rep.

HillaryÂ just laughed in her face. âIâm very sorry I got pneumonia, Iâm glad antibiotics took care of it, and thatâs behind us now,â the former Secretary of State said, somehow managing to avoid knocking the reporter for starting off by claiming 9/11 was âlast week.â Clinton explained that her health meets and exceeds the standards anyone else running for office has met, but Fazan was all âso, ummmm, you gonna take those tests?â âThereâs no need for that,â Clinton said firmly, surely wondering how the f*ck this woman got hired in the first place. âThe information is very clear.â  HillaryÂ wasnât the only person laughing at Fazan, who also beat the dead horse that is the email âscandal.â Twitter lit up with people mocking the reporter for having the gall to waste time during an exclusive interview badgering the 2016 Democratic nominee about her health: @hannahfc and you are reporting this nonsense as if it is legitimate.

But, Anderson Cooper wasnât buying it. âBut statistically, thereâs not really much evidence that that is actually occurring in the United States,â Cooper said. âAmongst some immigrant groups in small numbers it may be occurring but in no statistical measure is it significant.â Then â right after commercial break â Anderson Cooper again came back in order to set the record straight. The only thing Trumpâs campaign manager could do was force a fakeÂ smile. âBefore the break, Kellyanne, you mentioned the Guttmacher Institute information on sex-selective abortion in the United States,â Cooper said. âHereâs what they actually say in a May 30 press release titled âSex Selective Abortion Bans: A Disingenuous New Strategy to Limit Womenâs Access to Abortion.ââ âThe study acknowledges the practice does go on overseas, as we mentioned, and perhaps in certain Asian-American communities in the United States in small numbers,â Copper continued. âBut, quote, âIn the United States, meanwhile, there is limited data indicating that sex-selective abortion may be occurring in some Asian communities.

1194,"The White House would prefer to avoid a government shutdown, but “it’s not at all clear” that President Barack Obama would sign the continuing resolution put forward Thursday by Republicans to fund the government through Dec. 9, an administration spokesman cautioned Friday. White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Friday raised the possibility of Obama vetoing the legislation Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) proposed Thursday, warning Republicans that the measure's lack of money for addressing Flint, Michigan’s lead crisis — and its failure to include a change to campaign finance disclosure law that Democrats want — raises serious concerns for the president. Story Continued Below “You know, one of the reasons I was a little late in joining you all today is I had an opportunity to talk with the president in the Oval Office about this proposal, and after that conversation it’s not at all clear to me that he is prepared to sign this bill because he believes that Congress has got some work to do,” Earnest told reporters Friday at the daily press briefing. “And hopefully they’ll get to work on that and get it done without putting the American people and the American economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.” Speaking from the Senate floor Thursday, McConnell praised what he called a “clean continuing resolution” as “many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.” Congress has until next Friday to pass legislation to head off a government shutdown. “It’s a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through Dec. 9, while also providing funding for the new legislation we’ve just passed overwhelmingly and that the president has signed — that’s legislation to address the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic and the TSCA bill.,” McConnell said. According to the White House, though, it falls short of expectations. Earnest said McConnell’s proposal does include “some attractive elements,” such as the fact that it would keep the government funded for a few additional weeks and help fund a response to the Zika crisis. “We were, however, disappointed that for — that Congress has not made a commitment to addressing the situation in Flint,” Earnest said, adding that while many Democrats are advocating for such, not enough Republicans are following suit. “And the president is concerned that that situation has not been addressed in the context of these ongoing negotiations. So he’s concerned about that.” “The president’s also concerned about the fact that the proposal includes a rider that would essentially protect the ability of special interests to funnel money into political campaigns without having to disclose it,” Earnest continued. “That’s — first of all, I don’t really know what a proposal like that’s doing in a budget bill, setting aside the fact that transparency in government and transparency in politics is something that is worthy of bipartisan support.”",1,0,0
832,"President Obama and Black Lives Matter have consistently over the past year tried to push the narrative that only black people are being unjustly persecuted because of their race. But another video released on the Internet debunks that ridiculous notion. A Black Lives Matter thug viciously attacked an innocent an unarmed woman. The footage is quite shocking. Last week two young women were savagely attacked in Stockton, California after attempting to leave a Red Robin establishment. CBS Local reported that a vigil was being held by protesters to commemorate Colby Friday. He was an African American man that had been killed by police back in August of this year.  The two girls were Caucasian and were walking past the vigil while it occurred. When they were questioned by police they said they believed the attacks were racially motivated. Because if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s not a pig. Assistant District Attorney Ron Freitas told the media that the attack involved several people who were from out of town and that their motivations for attending the protest and for attacking the girls had nothing to do with Colby’s death and the protests, indicating that it was racially motivated. A $10,000 reward has been placed for anyone who can provide information that will lead to the capture of these barbarians. This country is a lot less safe with these animals running around. However, unsurprisingly, the mainstream liberal media has ignored this incident and it has gone largely unreported. Because of course it does not fit into the narrative of the oppression of African-Americans. It makes Black Lives Matter look bad. In fact it makes them look racist! Which is the very thing they accuse white people of being. It also makes them the biggest hypocrites known to man. But then again, liberals have the trademark on hypocrisy. ",0,0,1
340,"Washington (CNN)A brewing civil war within the GOP has House Republicans picking sides, with plenty of members backing up party Chairman Reince Priebus in threatening consequences for those who don't get behind nominee Donald Trump. ""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Arizona Rep. Trent Franks told CNN Wednesday. ""Therefore they are betraying this party. They are betraying the Constitution."" Franks had endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the primary. The rancor comes after Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that if Trump opponents don't ""get on board,"" it's not ""going to be that easy for them"" to run for office again. The remark appeared to be directed at former presidential candidates like Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who all have refused to endorse Trump after signing a pledge to do so during the primary campaign. Priebus' comments prompted pushback, including from top Kasich strategist John Weaver, who retorted that Kasich ""will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" The GOP's next civil war is brewing But House Republicans had Priebus' back. While none discussed explicit penalties for future candidates based on their opposition to Trump, they warned that there would be political consequences. ""Having on your resume that you were all in against the nominee -- (with a) record number of votes won fair and square -- having on your record that you were against the nominee is not a positive for future political aspirations,"" said Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei. Several prominent Republicans in addition to the former candidates have publicly said they won't back Trump. On Tuesday, sources said that former President George H.W. Bush had told Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend that he would be voting for Clinton. Sources: Bush 41 says he'll vote for Clinton Clinton has also been endorsed by Republicans including HP CEO and former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman; a top adviser to Arizona Sen. John McCain, Mark Salter; and former George W. Bush administration Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. Former GOP nominee Mitt Romney has also spoken forcefully against Trump, though he has not endorsed Clinton. And current sitting lawmakers -- including Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo -- have said they will not vote for the brash real estate mogul. Kirk and Curbelo are both facing reelection. On Wednesday, Curbelo brushed off the idea that he is hurting his party. ""Every American has to make the best choice for their country,"" Curbelo told CNN. ""Jack Kemp said you serve your party best by serving your country first, that's what I do here every day."" But Curbelo's colleagues maintained he will have to face the voters' reaction to his opposition to the party's standard-bearer. ""There's already some unrest among Republicans that there are some who have chosen not to get behind their nominee, the person they picked,"" said Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta. ""I can sense that as we travel around, and I think that will be lasting."" ""I do anticipate there will be some type of reaction to that,"" said Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, referring to Priebus' threat. Trump has been endorsed by the Republican leaders in the House and Senate, but the relationship has been strained. Though they support voting for Trump, both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have continued to on occasion criticize him publicly. The House's No. 2 Republican didn't fully back Priebus' comments on Tuesday, saying threats were not good motivation to come together. ""There's a better way to unite people. I'm not a big believer that punishment unites people,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters. ""If Hillary (Clinton) can't unite Republicans, I don't think anything can."" ",1,0,0
1421,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities. Case in point. The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real. This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids. The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right? In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them. Wow. There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit: As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers. Yikes. But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",0,0,1

1001,"Six months after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, my then girlfriend (now wife), Liz, and I first arrived in St. Bernard Parish as volunteers. There we met a World War II veteran named Mr. Andre who like many of his generation had been proud and independent his whole life, never needing assistance and certainly never asking for it if he did. Though he used a walker, he insisted on holding his own food tray at the relief tent where we were working. Mr. Andre was a regular at the tent and after speaking with him at mealtime for three days, he finally broke down sobbing. He told us that every day for the past three months, he’d been sleeping in his pickup truck. Three times a day, before each meal, he would drive to a temporary FEMA site to apply for aid. Each time, he would be denied. Mr. Andre had reached his breaking point right there in front of us. Mr. Andre’s story is all too common after a disaster strikes. Eleven years after Katrina, despite tremendous progress, too many homeowners have not been able to rebuild. Four years after Sandy, thousands of New Yorkers and New Jersey citizens still have no predictable time frame for their return home. Now, after the torrential flooding in South Louisiana in August, more than 70,000 families — the vast majority of which, did not live in mandatory flood insurance zones and, therefore, did not have flood insurance — have just started down the arduous, painful slog that is disaster recovery in America. A delayed, unpredictable, inefficient, or otherwise prolonged recovery takes an enormous human toll. As it works now, the “traditional model” of disaster recovery in this country forces too many of our fellow citizens to stare into the abyss of uncertainty after disaster, not knowing when they’ll get home or how to navigate the myriad steps they’ll need to take to get there. During this time, retirees and seniors are robbed of their golden years as their savings are drained. For the young, fleeting formative years of childhood and adolescence are disrupted, and parents struggle to bring a sense of normalcy to their families while taking on the burden of a rent payment in addition to their mortgage payments. It doesn’t have to be this way. It shouldn’t be this way. People can be resilient to a point, but to maintain mental, physical, emotional and financial stability, they need predictability, certainty and transparency. They need hope and a clear path — one unencumbered by false starts, dead ends and unnecessary red tape. For the past 10 years, Liz and I have been running SBP, a national long-term disaster recovery organization. In that time, we’ve seen firsthand how Americans are hardwired to fix and solve problems, and answer the call in droves after disasters by volunteering or contributing. But we also have realized that, despite all of this generous support, there is only a certain amount of time that disaster survivors can endure, as they try to find the path home. Disasters today are more frequent, inflict more damage and occur in places with no history of such disasters. According to a 2013 study, since 2007, nearly 80 percent of the U.S. population — 243 million people — live in counties that experienced at least one weather-related federally declared disaster. Simply put, at a time when an efficient model is needed more than ever, disaster recovery in this country is not working as efficiently as it should or could. Nearly four years after Superstorm Sandy, only 50 percent of homeowners who qualify for assistance through New York City’s Build it Back program have received it. And yet, Mayor Bill DeBlasio has stated his intention to declare victory and shutter the program at the end of the year. In New Orleans, 11 years after Katrina, 3,000 previously independent homeowners can’t afford to rebuild without additional help. Citizens affected by the most recent flooding in West Virginia and Louisiana are unsure whether regional and partisan politics will prevent the allocation of federal funds. In a time of more frequent, severe and widespread disasters, the status quo in recovery cannot stand. We must not be afraid to adapt, innovate and reform our current long-term disaster recovery strategy. Admittedly, to do so requires a much larger, more nuanced policy conversation, but there are three straightforward suggestions which, if implemented, would greatly help shrink the time between disaster and recovery. First, the government should enable taxpayers to pre-register for FEMA and Small Business Administration Disaster Loans through their IRS tax filing. The majority of the information required to apply for FEMA and SBA aid following disaster is contained in annual taxpayer filings with the IRS. By enabling taxpayers to pre-register with FEMA and the SBA through their tax filings, citizens can be spared the aggravation — imagine trying to produce documentation after several feet of water has flooded your home and town hall — and delay in applying for federal disaster aid. Second, Congress should increase funding for AmeriCorps. National service — specifically through AmeriCorps — provides vital support and capacity to organizations that operate both in the short and long term after a disaster. Besides being a vehicle for citizens to serve their country, the very existence of the post-disaster ecosystem relies upon AmeriCorps and its members. Yet AmeriCorps funding is often uncertain, with lawmakers threatening to decrease or even defund the program on an annual basis. Given the increased pace and severity of disasters, lawmakers should stop viewing AmeriCorps as a line item to be cut for budgetary purposes and instead boost funding for AmeriCorps and provide more opportunities for Americans to serve hard-hit communities. Finally, the government should implement rapid, resilient, HUD-compliant housing recovery programs within the first few days after a disaster. Typically, it takes at least a year for HUD Community Development Block Grant funding to reach disaster affected communities. Waiting a year or more results in homeowner distress, community degradation, and increased costs to the federal government due to the amplified costs of mold and secondary damage. If instead, private capital investment stood up the first year or two of the recovery with a government guarantee, and was coupled with a streamlined environmental review processes that allowed damaged or destroyed properties to be rebuilt on their original footprint without the lengthy review required of new development, communities would recover much sooner. Those initial investments would then be reimbursed by HUD when those funds became available. In doing so, the pace and results of the recovery will have been sustained over the course of the initial year and the federal government would stand to save significant money. The cause of more frequent disasters is not up for debate. Thousand-year storms seem to be happening monthly. The effect too, is plain as day. In South Louisiana last month, more than 70,000 Americans lost their homes when an unnamed and unprecedented rainstorm dumped a record 30 inches of rain on the region over the course of two days. Homeowners who were told they had no need for flood insurance when they purchased their home, took on eight feet of muddy water, and are now staring into the abyss. The good news is that proven, actionable solutions exist to shrink the time between disaster and recovery. Now we must find the political will to fix this broken system. Our fellow Americans are counting on it. Zack Rosenburg is co-founder and CEO of SBP.",1,0,0
399,"(CNN)Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accused the United States Thursday of ""a lack of compliance"" with the nuclear deal agreed between Tehran and world powers last July. Speaking to global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Rouhani then attacked the US for what he described as ""illegal actions,"" referring to the US Supreme Court decision in April to allow US victims of terror to claim nearly $2 billion in compensation from Iran's central bank. The decision allows impounded Iranian assets to be distributed to more than 1,000 US survivors of terror attacks for which the US deems Iranian groups responsible. Rouhani blamed the ruling on the influence of ""Zionist pressure groups"" in Washington. Success of 'moderation' But the Iranian President, who faces an election in May and has been sharply criticized by hardliners for making concessions the US to accomplish the nuclear pact, did offer some positive words about the agreement. The ability of Iran and world powers to negotiate the deal indicates ""the success we can achieve through moderation, constructive interaction, dialogue -- the policy that brought an end to a long, complicated and unnecessary crisis by adopting a win-win approach,"" he told the gathered international luminaries. He added that ""it was a political deal that also represents a creative method ... to resolving international challenges."" But Rouhani still lit into the US at one point for its ""lack of compliance"" with the terms, saying that ""represents a flawed approach that should be rectified forthwith."" And he warned Washington that any failure to implement it ""will further erode the credibility of the US in the world."" US rejects accusations The US rejected the accusation that it is failing to keep up its end of the bargain. ""The United States has and will continue to implement its commitments under the deal with good faith and without exception,"" said a US State Department official, who added America has ""unequivocally met"" its terms and has ""made absolutely clear that we are committed to full and effective implementation of our sanctions-related commitments."" After Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities, years of tough economic sanctions were lifted under the deal, allowing Tehran's oil to be sold internationally. Iran has been frustrated that it has not seen more of an economic benefit stemming from the deal, with many countries still wary of doing business with the country. Spread of terror Rouhani's critique didn't stop there, blaming global powers' post 9/11 security strategies for ""the genesis of borderless violence and terrorism"" in the world. Speaking in New York 15 years after the mass terror attack, he said that ""no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters resulting in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe."" Inside 9/11: The day that never ends He pointed to the plight of the Syrian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Afghan and Palestinian people, while calling on neighbors to ""stop bombing each other and accept responsibility for past mistakes"". Saudi Arabia Iran's President also pointed his finger at regional rival Saudi Arabia, warning that the country must ""cease and desist from divisive policies"" if peace is to be found in the Middle East. ""If the Saudi government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from divisive policies, spread of hate ideology, and trampling upon the rights of neighbors,"" Rouhani told world leaders. Senate rejects bid to block US-Saudi Arabia arms deal Shi'ite-led Iran and the Saudi Arabian Sunni monarchy are on opposing sides of the Syrian conflict, with Iran sending forces and advisers to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while its rival supports Syrian rebel groups. They are also divided over Yemen. The Saudis have accused Iran of backing the Houthi rebels, who seized power from the government in March. At least 30 Yemeni civilians were killed Wednesday in Saudi-led airstrikes in the port region of Hodieda. ",1,0,0
457,"New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off for the first time on the debate stage Monday night, the biggest moment of the already extraordinary 2016 presidential race. With national polls showing a tight race just six weeks out from Election Day, the Hofstra University fight offers one of the last chances for each to speak directly to the tens millions of voters who are expected to tune in. What time is the debate? For Clinton, a veteran debater, one of her biggest challenges will be both to provoke Trump and avoid being provoked by him, while delivering an earnest and candid performance. What should you watch for at the debate? David Chalian breaks it down on ""The Daily DC"" And for Trump, who had uneven and at times explosive debate performances during the Republican primary, his first one-on-one debate presents a serious test of his ability to stay on script and keep his cool. Here are five things to watch at Monday night's debate: Which Donald Trump will show up? During the long Republican primary, there was no telling which Trump would show up to a debate. Sometimes it was the combative and hostile Trump -- quick to throw punches and go after his opponents with personal attacks. Other times, it was an uncharacteristically subdued Trump, content to disappear from the spotlight for long stretches of time and let his competitors command the stage and attack one another. ""We are preparing for different Trumps that might show up,"" Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters last week. ""He may be aggressive or he may lay back and that's hard to game out."" Being overtly antagonistic toward Clinton would be a risky move for Trump. If he is unable to keep calm and stay focused, it will only feed the narrative that he lacks the temperament to be president and potentially make him look small next Clinton, who is famous for being measured. Trump also won't have the option of sitting on the sidelines. As one of only two candidates on stage, the Republican nominee must make the most of every minute allotted to him and show a level of agility and rapid-response instincts that was far less critical on a debate stage with numerous candidates. Monday night will pose a critical test for Trump, who has so far shown a relative lack of depth on policy. With approximately half of the debate's 90 minutes dedicated to the GOP nominee, it will be far more difficult than in past debates for Trump to get by with sweeping statements that he is accustomed to making at rallies and in interviews, particularly given that Clinton's strong suit is policy. Can Clinton heed Obama advice to 'be yourself?' No one understands Clinton's debating chops better than President Barack Obama, who faced off against her numerous times in the 2008 election. Obama's advice to Clinton for Monday? ""Be yourself and explain what motivates you,"" the President told ABC's Robin Roberts last week. ""I think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. There's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who I know."" How Hillary Clinton took debate prep seriously So far in this campaign, Clinton has struggled to do precisely that, and appearing unguarded and likeable -- fairly or not -- has been one of her biggest political challenges. There's no question that policy is Clinton's forte -- aides to the former senator and secretary of state describe her as a wonk who knows policy inside and out. As she marshals her fluency in policy, she will want to avoid coming off as lecturing or smug, the way critics say Al Gore did in his debates with George W. Bush. But appearing next to Trump could help make Clinton more likable by comparison: Polls show that a majority of voters question Trump's temperament and view him as appealing to bigotry. The Clinton campaign says it plans to drive home the point that Trump habitually makes factually inaccurate statements. ""Donald Trump has pattern of repeating lies hoping no one will correct him,"" Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, said on a call with reporters last week. ""This warrants particular focus because his level of lying is unprecedented in American politics."" Clinton has acknowledged that she doesn't have the natural charisma of Obama or her husband, Bill Clinton, but she has fleshed out her personal story and offered a sharper positive message in recent weeks, and she will likely attempt to continue that effort on Monday. Things could get really personal The 2016 election has already showcased a whole lot of nasty name-calling, but Monday night has the potential to descend into the worst mudfight yet. Even before the debate had begun, the two campaigns were in full trolling mode. The Clinton campaign offered Mark Cuban -- the TV celebrity billionaire who recently endorsed the Democratic nominee -- a front row seat at Hofstra. Cuban has been relentless in attacking Trump-- in July, he said Trump ""went off the reservation and went bats -- crazy"" -- and he has also called out Trump for not releasing his tax returns. Having Cuban in the front row is the kind of mind game that the Clinton camp hopes will distract and throw Trump off his game. But in Trumpian fashion, the GOP nominee responded over the weekend by threatening to bring Gennifer Flowers as his guest to the debate. Flowers is a former Arkansas state employee who claimed to have had a multi-year sexual relationship with Bill Clinton. The former president has admitted to having a sexual encounter with her. The Trump campaign later said it won't invite Flowers to the debate. Still, Trump's comments may foreshadow his willingness to dredge up some of the most painful incidents from the Clintons' past, including Bill Clinton's various indiscretions. Hillary Clinton, too, could go there if provoked -- Trump has been married three times and has two messy divorces under his belt; has openly boasted in the past about his playboy lifestyle. Moreover his offensive remarks about women and minorities are part of her campaign's argument he is temperamentally unfit to be president. Asked by CNN on her plane earlier this month whether she believes it is fair game to go after Trump's personal life, Clinton didn't rule out the possibility. Trump, meanwhile, said on Fox News last week: ""If she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect."" The politics of race There's no shortage of top-tier issues -- terrorism, Syria, ISIS, immigration, the economy among them -- but the first general election match-up comes amid national outrage sparked yet again by police killings of African-American men. The recent deaths of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina and Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma have sparked fresh and impassioned calls for justice and protests that have at times turned violent. With the issue of police force -- particularly toward minorities -- dominating headlines, the politics of race is guaranteed to be a discussion topic. Race and racism in 2016 Both Clinton and Trump had planned to visit Charlotte -- where Scott was killed -- around the debate: Clinton on Sunday and Trump on Monday. But both campaigns scrapped those plans after Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts told CNN's Erin Burnett that the city was too stretched on resources. For both Clinton and Trump, the challenge will be to offer detailed proposals on how they would address unnecessary police violence and thoughtfully speak to a grieving community. It also gives both a chance to make arguments to key constituencies -- Clinton to African-Americans who voted with Obama, and Trump to GOP base voters with his ""law and order"" pitch. The debate will likely delve into many other policy issues including healthcare, trade, economy and foreign policy. But many of the core disagreements between Trump and Clinton are rooted in the different ways in which they view race and inclusion. The two nominees have starkly contrasting views on immigration, for example, and how to handle people who enter the country illegally. They also clash on the national security front — particularly on how they want to combat terrorism. Clinton has urged measured responses that ensure that an entire religion is not villanized -- Trump, meanwhile, has suggested using methods of racial profiling and keeping out entire ethnic groups as a safety measure. All eyes on Lester Holt No one who will face more pressure Monday night than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- except Lester Holt. The NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor and veteran newscaster is about to enter uncharted territory as the moderator of the first Clinton-Trump face-off. Monday will mark Holt's first time presiding over a general election presidential debate; some 70 to 100 million people are expected to tune in; and there is no telling what dynamics will drive ultimately drive the prime-time event. How Lester Holt is getting ready for Monday's debate Both campaigns have preemptively cranked up the heat, suggesting that Holt and the other moderators might be less than fair to their respective candidates. Palmieri told reporters last week that her biggest concern heading into the debate is that Trump and Clinton will be graded on different curves. ""You should be held to the same standard on knowledge, what kind of plans you have, your ability to explain your plans,"" she said. ""Our concern is just what kind of standard is he held to."" Trump, meanwhile, has suggested that Holt is a Democrat. ""Lester is a Democrat. I mean, they are all Democrats. OK? It's a very unfair system,"" Trump said. (Holt is actually a registered Republican.) What Holt wants to avoid at all costs is the fate that recently befell his NBC colleague Matt Lauer. The ""Today"" show host moderated the network's ""Commander-in-Chief Forum"" earlier this moth, and the reviews were disastrous. Lauer was accused of multiple transgressions, including aggressively interrupting Clinton, spending too much time grilling her on the email controversy, asking Trump relatively soft-ball questions and failing to call him out when he falsely stated that he had opposed the Iraq War. With regard to fact-checking, ""Lester is not going to be a potted plant,"" one NBC staffer close to Holt said. ",1,0,0
10,"President Barack Obama characterized Donald Trump's presidential campaign as an ""infomercial"" during a fundraiser in Manhattan Sunday night. In town for this week's United Nations General Assembly, Obama spoke to supporters at the Gramercy Park home of restaurateur Danny Meyer and his wife Audrey. ""This guy's unqualified to be president and he shows no interest in even gaining the rudimentary knowledge required to make really hard decisions on a day to day basis,"" Obama said of the Republican presidential candidate. ""There's no curiosity. There's no desire to get up to speed. It's a infomercial. It's a reality show."" Trump previously appeared on several seasons of NBC's reality show, ""The Apprentice,"" and he has also lent his name to several products over the course of his career, including menswear, alcohol, magazines and hotels. And in a nod to Trump's comments and policies that have been slammed by critics as racist and xenophobic, Obama said, ""It's tapping into some of our worst impulses ... one's that divide us rather then bring us together. One's that seek to put down people who have been historically vulnerable opposed to lifting them up."" Obama admitted that presidential race will be a close race, explaining, ""So this should not be a close election but it will be and the reason it will be is not because of Hillary's flaws but rather because structurally we've become a very polarized society and if all you're doing is watching Fox News and listening to Rush Limbaugh... a lot of misinformation on a regular basis, it's very hard for you to think that you're going to vote for somebody who you've been told is taking the country in the wrong direction."" The president also acknowledge that Americans are still trying to come to terms with having a female president. ""I will also say that there's a reason why we haven't had a women president... As a society we still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. And it still troubles us in a lot of ways unfairly. And that expresses itself in all sorts of ways."" ",1,0,0
75,"As millions of voters tune in to watch the first presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, there are several key issues to keep in mind. The general election has been playing out for about two months now, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton taking direct aim at each other, but tonight will be the first time that they square off directly. Watch the first presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. Eastern time. on Monday.    Clinton has been preparing for her 35th presidential election debate for weeks. Aides say the former secretary of state — who is known for doing her homework — has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a Trump stand-in, Clinton's longtime aide Philippe Reines. She has said she expects it to be a ""difficult, challenging"" debate. Her campaign has even consulted with ""The Art of the Deal"" ghostwriter Tony Schwartz on how to beat him in a debate. Trump was in debate prep meetings all day Friday after focusing more on campaigning than studying up for the showdown. Though no mock debates occurred, he was asked rounds of questions he could face from tonight's moderator. The sessions were led by Trump surrogate and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, along with the campaign leadership.    Acknowledging that there are concerns about his tone, Trump has repeatedly said that he plans to be polite — but only to a point. ""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" Trump said during a interview on Fox News on Thursday. ""I think she deserves that, and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me, that’ll be nice. We'll have something that I think people will respect as a debate, but we'll see where it all goes. You really never know exactly how it's going to turn out, and that's why we're going to have a lot of people watching,"" he said. For her part, Clinton and her team have spoken about how they had to prep by facing off against two versions of Trump: the more professional, contained version that has been present on the trail more recently and the more bombastic, uncontrolled version that was seen more during the primaries.  Chelsea Clinton will attend the debate, a first for her this election cycle, after not attending any of the Democratic primary debates. And another familiar face is expected to be in the front row supporting Team Clinton: Mark Cuban. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is a vocal Clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play Trump in her mock debates. He said earlier this week that the Clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move.  Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the ""Humbling at Hofstra"" on Monday. It Is On !  If Cuban is being put in the front row as some kind of psychological ploy, the television audience shouldn't expect to enjoy his presence. Peter Eyre, a senior adviser with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events, told ABC News that the live audience will not be on camera during the debate at Hofstra University tonight. There are expected to be about 1,000 people in the audience.    Lester Holt from NBC's ""Nightly News"" has been tasked with moderating tonight's debate, and he's under some pressure. NBC hosted the recent Commander in Chief Forum, during which both candidates fielded questions about their plans for the military, and Holt's colleague Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his performance. Critics complained that he focused more on Clinton's email scandal than anything to do with the military and that he let Trump make claims that were false without any intervention. The question of how much fact-checking moderators should do during the debates has been raised. Trump has said that he does not believe the moderators should intervene to fact-check, and Clinton raised money off Lauer's lack of fact-checking after the forum, indicating that she would be in favor of moderators' playing a role.  It's estimated that tens of millions of people will watch the debate in real time, and many more will be influenced by the social media spin in the aftermath, when the debate about the debate takes place online. Clinton's campaign is well aware that the outcome of the debate depends not just on what the two candidates say onstage but also on the conversation that takes place around it. On a conference call with supporters on Friday, a top aide to Clinton directly asked their supporters to use social media during and after the debate to help shape the conversation positively around the Democratic nominee. The campaign's digital director, Jenna Lowenstein, said two of the campaign's goals for the night are to amplify Clinton's best moments online and to influence the narrative about who is winning. ""It's important that we're not just turning this into the Donald Trump show,"" Lowenstein said. She instructed, ""Tweet early, tweet her name, use those hashtags.""

342,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton continues to lead in New Hampshire, according to the latest survey from Monmouth University released Wednesday. The poll showed 47% of likely voters in the state backing Clinton, compared with 38% who support Donald Trump. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson has 10% support, according to Monmouth. Clinton has led Trump in almost every poll out of New Hampshire, and a Republican has not carried the state since George W. Bush won there in 2000. But Monmouth's findings pointed to a much wider lead for the former secretary of state than a NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll conducted there earlier this month, which showed Clinton and Trump virtually deadlocked in the Granite State. The Monmouth poll was conducted September 17-20 using phone interviews with 400 likely New Hampshire voters. It has a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. ",1,0,0
960,"Donald Trump’s campaign on Monday hit back at the White House’s characterization that the U.S. is in a “narrative fight” with the Islamic State, insisting “we should all be very concerned” by the Obama administration’s assessment. “For the U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria who are on the front lines against ISIS, it’s a real fight where we’ve lost real lives,” Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement. “Diminishing the threat the Obama Administration has allowed to materialize on its watch puts us all at risk and is another reminder that we need new leadership in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism. Hillary Clinton has backed President Obama’s failed ISIS strategy to the hilt, and voters should know whether she too shares the White House’s troubling assessment of the situation.” Story Continued Below In an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo on Monday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest pointed to the ongoing battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.” “When it comes to ISIL, we are in a fight, a narrative fight, with them. A narrative battle,” Earnest said. “And what ISIL wants to do is they want to project that they are an organization that is representing Islam in a fight and a war against the West, and a war against the United States. That is a bankrupt false narrative. It’s a mythology, and we have made progress in debunking that mythology.” During his phone interview with Fox News on Monday, Trump seemingly suggested that law enforcement officials should profile Muslims to stop terrorist attacks, a remark that came in response to the bombing in New York on Saturday that injured 29 people, and again hammered President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for refusing to call out “radical Islamic terrorism.” “Here’s another element of this fight,” Earnest added. “We can’t play into this narrative that somehow the United States or the West is against — is fighting against the Muslim religion.”",1,0,0
417,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign has a question for voters: Is Donald Trump the president we want for our daughters? The Clinton campaign will begin airing a new ad Friday that intercuts Trump insulting women with shots of young girls looking in the mirror. ""I'd look her right in that fat ugly face of hers,"" Trump says in the ad, a comment he made in 2006 about comedian Rosie O'Donnell. ""She is a slob."" The ad, entitled ""Mirrors,"" also features Trump saying ""A person who is flat chested is very hard to be a 10"" -- a comment he made about actress Nicollette Sheridan -- and ""Does she have a good body, no? Does she have a fat (expletive)? Absolutely."" -- a comment he made about Kim Kardashian in 2013. While these comments are playing, the ad features a diverse group of young women looking in the mirror, appearing to evaluate themselves as Trump's voice makes demeaning comments. The end of the ad features a black slate with this question: ""Is this the president we want for our daughters?"" The ad will air Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and on national cable, according to a campaign release. The release did not say how much money was being spent on the ad. Throughout her campaign, Clinton has argued that Trump would be ill-equipped president to handle issues that matter to women and girls. ""Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what's best for women,"" Clinton said in June. ""And after all, this is a man who has called women 'pigs,' 'dogs,' and 'disgusting animals.' Kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights."" Clinton's new ad is the latest that goes after Trump's character and mimics an ad Priorities USA, her top-dollar super PAC, released in May that similarly questioned a comment Trump made about respecting women.

In fact, Bono says, Trump could âdestroyâ the very idea of America: âLook, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,â Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told âCBS This Morningâ in an interview broadcast Tuesday. âBut Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.

They are calling for his head on a platter for asking Hillary about her email crimes. The rightwing saw the interview as a surprise since leftists normally do their utmost to shield Hillary and avoid exposing her crimes. But then they saw that Lauer didn’t go into as much detail as they would have and that he did go after Trump, but not to the degree with which leftist fanatics would have and that has sent those leftwingnuts over the edge. In the coming debate between Trump and Hillary, they are calling on their moderators to “fact check” Trump, but not Hillary. The purpose of journalism is to inform you of events. You are then free to decide your opinion of those events. Opinions expressed in the media are supposed to be from either the public or the editors. But that is not what the leftist media practices today. Remember the 2nd Romney-Obama debate? The moderator took over debating Romney and backed Obama’s lie that he said the assassination of Ambassador Stevens was a terror attack.

1572,"The absolute legend and all-time great of professional basketball, Micheal Jordan, weighed in on the riots over police shootings in Charlotte. BlackLivesMatter may find it hard to see such a giant in the black community actually agree with common sense and stability, yes.  But they are especially going to have a difficult time choking down what he says and what he did to aid the police. “First, I want to express my condolences to the Scott family for their loss. I also wish for a full recovery to those who have been injured. In light of the tragic events of the past three days, it is more important than ever that we restore calm and come together, as a community, in peaceful demonstration and conversation, and in constructive and non-violent ways,” Jordan stated clearly. You see? He didn’t draw a line in the sand between points of view. He just drew a line between civil discourse and destructive anarchy, which is exactly what is going on with the George Soros funded BlackLivesMatter.  Jordan dove a little deeper into the conversation a bit early in a statement, in which he said “I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported,” Bravo! Bravo, Sir! That is the kind of wisdom that has held this society together for so long. Love one another. Serve one another. It really is that simple. It’s easy for an athlete celebrity to talk the talk…people are going to listen. But this is where Jordan really earns the respect due, “To support that effort, I am making contributions of $1 million each to two organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,”   The NAACP? I could do without. They have done nothing to strengthen the black community, other than push for Marxist policies and laws. As for the other donation, well done sir.

288,"Washington (CNN)Did he really say that again? And again?  At a Florida rally Monday night, Donald Trump twice repeated the false claim that he opposed the Iraq War before it started. ""I was against going into the war in Iraq, he told the crowd, ""but we got out the wrong way. President Obama did a terrible thing the way he got us out of the war.""  But CNN's research shows no evidence for his repeated claim of opposition to the war before it started. Instead, during a September 2002 interview on Howard Stern's radio show Trump was asked if he supported invading Iraq. ""Yeah, I guess so,"" he answered. Hardly a ringing endorsement of the upcoming war. But nowhere near full-throated opposition.  In an August speech, Trump pointed to an interview with Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto, three months before the war started, to bolster his case that he opposed the war. At one point in the interview, he expressed impatience with President George W. Bush for not starting the war.  ""Well, I'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy,"" he said. ""They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we're going in, we're not going in, the -- you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn't talk. We have to -- you know, it's sort like either do it or don't do it.""  Later in the interview, Trump said the war was not a higher priority than the economy. But he never said it should not be undertaken. ""He's under a lot of pressure,"" Trump said of Bush. ""I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraq situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.""  It wasn't until August 2004 -- 17 months after the invasion began and the war was being widely criticized -- that Trump came out fully against the war. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed,"" he said in an interview with Esquire magazine. ""And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!""  This gap between what Trump claims and the evidence to the contrary has been pointed out many times. Yet he keeps repeating the claims. Given that, it is hard to come to any other conclusion than that he is simply lying.  ",1,0,0
308,"(CNN)US forces will be ready within weeks to help Iraqi forces in their battle to retake Mosul from ISIS, according to Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Our job is to actually help the Iraqis generate the forces and the support necessary for operations in Mosul and we'll be ready for that in October,"" Dunford told a small group of reporters traveling with him. ""The noose is gradually tightening around Mosul,"" he added. The city, Iraq's second-largest, is ISIS' last significant stronghold in the country. It and Syria's Raqqa -- the group's self-declared capital -- are the major targets left for the US-led coalition to take back from its control. Dunford's statement is the clearest sign from a senior US military official that the military battle for Mosul could soon begin once the Iraqis make the political decision to proceed. It also means the battle for Mosul may be raging during the US presidential election, with US forces facing dangers on the battlefield. Those troops might also be called upon to help begin providing humanitarian aid. Dunford, along with Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. Both are expected to face stiff questioning from Republicans on the panel about the Obama administration's strategy to fight ISIS. CNN has learned the Pentagon is now considering setting up new remote bases well outside Mosul as hubs from which US forces can operate. Those types of bases, given their locations, are likely to be less secure than the large bases the US has generally been using. They could be used by US military advisers who are expected to work with the Iraqis in the field. Because of the remote locations, security may be difficult. US forces may move ""in and out"" of the bases rather than locate there consistently, one official said. These bases are in addition to the large Iraqi base south of Mosul at Qayyarah, where hundreds of US troops are already located to assist with supplies, logistics and support for the Iraqi forces. A key decision to be made is whether additional US conventional and special operations forces will be needed for ensuring the Iraqis succeed, several US defense official told CNN. The US forces will not be on the front lines but will be out in the field with Iraqi units, officials said. Some forces already in Iraq could be reassigned to northern Iraq, or additional forces could be sent. President Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's meeting in New York Monday also signaled the Mosul operation may soon unfold. ""We feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly,"" Obama said. Calling Mosul a ""challenging battle,"" Obama also noted that the US will be ""prepared to help provide rapid humanitarian assistance"" to displaced Iraqis. Abadi underscored the urgency. ""We hope within the next few months we're going to kick Daesh out of Mosul and we'll deliver a huge blow to what Daesh believes in,"" said Abadi, using another name for the terrorist group. ",1,0,0
634,"Mohamed Hamada’s book The Trump Revolution is available for FREE here until the election.  Read Introduction and Chapter I here.  The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable businessmen, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. With the “country,” I mean America not China or Mexico. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. Let me say something, when you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game even if you don’t like them. However, if you head the federation of that sport you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. Now we are ready for the whipping. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. You can even call them the neo-lords. Let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. America is the land of the free. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. At the old time the lord was the owner and the ruler. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. The system developed. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. And so, less shoppers and buyers. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. He has to take part in building the country. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm……. The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. Selfishness, greed, I would say treason. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. They just found themselves loosing. The elite-businessmen’s media: Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. Trump should be proud they are all against him. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! They ignore the real issues like jobs and economy and they look for personal issues about Trump and they talk about his personal issues nostop. While on the other hand, they avoid Hillary’s scandals. Best case scenario, they hardly mention it briefly, then they try to cast doubts on these scandals. What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Explaining what is being plotted against them. That is what they are supposed to do. But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. The elite-businessmen’s politicians: Welcome to the employees of the elite- businessmen. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. They are playing a game they call an election. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. We want you to do so and so…. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. End of the scenario. It is literally a deal with the devil. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks.

871,"While the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.  According to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, “Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.” Although Ogborn’s plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, Matt Pearce’s tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable “news-worthy formula” usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality. Despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that “Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face” due to the fact that “Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.” ",0,1,0
920,"Early on in tonight’s presidential debate Donald Trump himself admitted that he was shedding all pretense of reality in his attacks on Hillary Clinton, replying “Why not?” in response to Clinton’s sarcastic comment that Mr. Trump might as well “blame [her] for anything that’s happened ever.” He quickly lived up to his own idiotic remark, most delusionally by claiming that Mrs. Clinton had been “fighting ISIS for 30 years” despite the fact that ISIS has only existed since 2013. In the real world, the Islamic State was founded in 2013 and only acquired widespread notice with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s declaration of a caliphate in June of 2014, three and a half years ago. Since then, of course, Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Obama administration have worked tirelessly to combat the threat of ISIS both in the Middle East and abroad, and America’s military efforts have resulted in tremendous setbacks for the militant group in terms of both territory lost and fighters killed. So while Trump’s suggestion is that Clinton has done nothing against ISIS in thirty years of work, the reality is that she and the Obama administration have dealt a tremendous blow to the group in the few years since it was founded. In an attempt to be generous to Trump’s lies, it should be noted that the organization currently known as ISIS grew out of the earlier Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia (AQAM), which was founded in 2004 to fight the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. So, at best, ISIS has been around for twelve years, but AQAM, in its alliance with the ideologically distinct Al-Qaeda, was tremendously different than the ISIS of today. To go back 30 years in the history of jihad would take us to 1986, when various jihadist groups in Afghanistan, including those of Osama bin Laden’s, were being funded and trained by Ronald Reagan’s CIA. It was Bill Clinton’s administration that first recognized jihadism as a large-scale threat, and his CIA amassed a litany of intelligence on al-Qaeda, all of which was ignored by the Bush administration. Trump’s claim that ISIS has existed for thirty years demonstrates his shocking ignorance of the most basic elements of global politics, and his underlying claim that Democrats are “weak” on jihadism is objectively backwards.",0,1,0
197,"It’s night-impossible to spend five minutes in a Fox News comment thread without coming across something that would give even a Klansman pause to say “hey man, can you tone it down? That’s a bit too racist.” But buried within the Stupid Part of America’s criticisms of a kind, 6-year-old New York boy who wrote to President Obama to ask if a little Syrian boy  who was rescued from a building that had been hit by an airstike was a comment from one of Trump’s “deplorables” that explains why conservatives are the way they are.   “Dear President Obama. Remember the boy who was picked up by the ambulance in Syria?” the boy, Alex, read in a video posted by the White House. “Can you please go get him and bring him to our home? Park in the driveway or on the streets and we’ll be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers and balloons.” “We will give him a family and he will be our brother,” Alex says. “Catherine, my little sister, will be collecting butterflies and fireflies for him. “We can invite him to birthday parties and he will teach us another language … And I will share my bike and I will teach him how to ride it. I will teach him additions and subtractions in math.” “These are the words of a six-year-old boy — a young child who has not learned to be cynical or suspicious or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray,” Obama wrote on his Facebook page, adding “we should all be more like Alex.” It’s a beautiful story – one of hope and pure love that all of us should feel fortunate just to be aware of.  Naturally, conservatives had to sh*t all over it:  You might be wondering how a group of people can be so racist and…deplorable. Fortunately, one of them hopped out of the basket to inform you. “What’s wrong with being a racist?” one commenter calling himself “VarnstarkBittlewater” asks when someone remarks that the comments got quite, quite racist. Another person, “pdubya,” replies “everyone is” to which Mr. Bittlewater responds, “my point exactly.”  In case you missed it, conservatives genuinely believe everyone — black, white, polka-dot — is a racist at his or her core, and that this excuses their racism. After all, “if everyone is doing it…” You can watch the video below. At least you’ll appreciate how awesome it is:  Featured image via screengrab",0,1,0
305,"Washington (CNN)During an interview with Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly Monday night, Donald Trump spoke about how American screeners need to profile people in order to spot potential terrorists. Here's a portion of that conversation: O'Reilly: Now, another thing you said that was very controversial is that you want to profile. You want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work? Trump: Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully. O'Reilly: They do it at the airports. They do it at the airports. Trump: Well, they do it. They do it. And when they see somebody that they would like to talk to, that they would like to look at, that they would maybe like to open up their satchel and take a look inside, they do it. And they don't like to do it. I don't like to do it. But we have to be -- you know, you have a woman who is 87-year-old in a wheelchair from Sweden and we have to look at her. We have to look at somebody else. It's ridiculous what's going on there. O'Reilly: So, what would you do though? Trump: If you want to be so politically correct -- O'Reilly: Do you have a vision of how that profiling would work? Trump: It works. And we see somebody that we think there could be a problem. At airports and other places. You talked to them and you see what's going on. O'Reilly: But I think they do that now. Trump: We don't do that. As Trump would say, excuse me, excuse me -- but we do. Screening at airports does not just entail putting everyone through a metal detector. The Transportation Security Administration has had protocols for years that tell agents what kinds of behaviors to check. But TSA insists it is behavioral, not racial, profiling. Last year, TSA began a pilot program to update these protocols. The agencies does not publicly lists the kinds of activities that can draw an agent's attention. But in March 2015, The Intercept website published what it said was a confidential memo that told TSA screeners at that time what to look for. Among the suspicious signs: - Exaggerated yawning. - Excessive complaints about the screening process. - Widely open staring eyes. - Wearing improper attire for location. - Whistling as the individual approaches the screening process. - Gazing down. - Exaggerated or repetitive grooming gestures. - Face pale from recent shaving of beard. - Rubbing or wringing of hands. - Excessive throat clearing So if TSA is already profiling people based on behavior, what further profiling would Trump like them to do?

1602,"Dashboard camera and helicopter footage of Tulsa, Oklahoma police killing 40-year-old Terence Crutcher contradict the police account of the shooting. On Friday, September 16, Crutcher, a father of four, was heading home from music appreciation class at Tulsa Community College when his SUV broke down in the middle of 36th Street North and Lewis Avenue. Shortly after police arrived on the scene, Crutcher, who had no weapon on his person or in his vehicle, was shot and killed with his hands in the air. New York Daily News columnist Shaun King tweeted the dash cam video, which shows police killing Crutcher at the 17-second mark: The @TulsaPolice Execution of #TerenceCrutcher. Shot fired at 0:17. Then they abandon him. ARREST THEM RIGHT NOW pic.twitter.com/SHgQb1MVlQ — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 19, 2016  Tulsa police spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie told the Associated Press that Crutcher was uncooperative with officers who arrived on the scene. “He refused to follow commands given by the officers,” MacKenzie told the AP. “They continued to talk to him, he continued not to listen and follow any commands.” However, helicopter footage obtained and published by the Tulsa World shows Crutcher had his hands up the entire time during his fatal encounter with responding officers. In the helicopter footage, a police officer is heard saying, “That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.”  Video of Crutcher’s killing has gone viral on social media. One Twitter user pointed out the discrepancy with how officers killed Crutcher within minutes of arriving, compared to how police in New York City apprehended the Chelsea bombing suspect alive after a shootout.

In an interview with the , pastor Rodney Goss, of the Morning Star Baptist Church in Tulsa, said the police department’s account of events is completely contradictory with video evidence. “His hands were in the air from all views,” Goss said. “It was not apparent at any angle from any point that he lunged, came toward, aggressively attacked, or made any sudden movements that would have been considered a threat or life-threatening toward the officer.” Officer Betty Shelby, who fired the shot that killed Crutcher, has been placed on paid administrative leave.        ",0,1,0
696,"Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah’s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election. Last week, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference, Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency. “I froze,” Brennan said. “This was back in 1980, and I thought back to a previous election where I voted, and I voted for the Communist Party candidate.” Claiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech, he said he decided to answer truthfully. “We’ve all had indiscretions in our past,” he said. “I would not be up here if that was disqualifying.” “I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, ‘OK, here’s the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'” Brennan said. The question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act, which “prohibit[ed] certain subversive activities,” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence. Thus the question that is routinely asked is, “Have you EVER advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?” “I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change,” Bennan added. “I said I’m not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, ‘OK,’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, ‘Well, I’m screwed.'” Brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating, “So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, ‘I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall’ … and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that’s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government.” It’s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi, wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress, but kept it classified, is known as a bully, and has continued to help aid America’s enemies in the Middle East. We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible, but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history. Between 1950 and 1957, many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism. According to Wikipedia: After a ten-month trial at the Foley Square Courthouse in Manhattan, eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949.[50] Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $10,000 fines. An eleventh defendant, Robert G. Thompson, a distinguished hero of the Second World War, was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record. The five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences. Those convicted appealed the verdicts, and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in Dennis v. United States in a 6-2 decision. Following that decision, the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases. In total, by May 1956, another 131 communists were indicted, of whom 98 were convicted, nine acquitted, while juries brought no verdict in the other cases.[51] Other party leaders indicted included Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a founding member of the ACLU. However, June 17, 1957, Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept.” However, consider that that new Cold War, which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us, is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan, Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power? And do you really think they are not out to silence your opposition to you? If you do, then you are a part of the problem.

674,"For the last two nights, events in Charlotte have been out of control. Protesters quickly turned into violent domestic terrorists destroying personal property, setting fires, looting stores, attacking reporters, photographers, police, and other innocent bystanders in response to the officer-involved shooting of Keith Scott, a black man who was shot by a black officer after he did not heed commands to drop his weapon. The narrative told by the anarchists, however, is that Scott was reading a book, even though no book was found on the scene. On Tuesday night, a truck driver feared for her life as her truck was surrounded by a mob of people who looted the contents of her truck and burned them in the middle of the street. More than 16 officers had to receive medical attention at the hospital due to attacks by the rabid mob. On Wednesday night, a photographer was rendered unconscious by these domestic terrorists who then tried to throw him into a burning trash can. Another white man was targeted and attacked by a mob of black men who dragged him, kicked him, and stomped on him. A “protester” was shot by another “protester” and is fighting for his life. The situation in Charlotte is so out of control that a State of Emergency was called last night and the National Guard has been deployed for Thursday. But looking at Barack Obama’s Twitter account, you wouldn’t know that anything at all has been happening in Charlotte. One would be under the impression there is no unrest, violence, and destruction of a city at all, let alone two nights in a row. Why is that? Because Obama has not made a peep about it on Twitter. He has not said one solitary thing about the chaos and violence in Charlotte. Instead, he’s busy tweeting trying to strong-arm Congress into confirming his Supreme Court choice, Merrick Garland, and about climate change. On Wednesday, the day after the first night of mayhem and violence, Obama tweeted twice about climate change and twice about Merrick Garland.

He uses it as a mouthpiece and propaganda tool. His 77.5 million followers would have no idea that anything is happening in Charlotte since Obama, the current President of the United States, has not even so much as acknowledged it at all.

244,"(CNN)A top aide to Ohio Gov. John Kasich criticized Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus after the party chairman warned of consequences for former presidential candidates like Kasich who've refused to back Donald Trump for president, despite signing loyalty pledges during the primary. ""The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does,"" said John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist. ""He will not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs."" Weaver was responding to Priebus' appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. During that interview, the RNC chairman suggested that GOP presidential candidates who'd signed pledges to back the eventual Republican nominee during the 2016 primary, but who have since withheld support for Trump's candidacy, could be prevented from running for president again by the party. Kasich has repeatedly said he does not plan to endorse Trump. ""Those people need to get on board,"" Priebus said. ""And if they're thinking they're going to run again someday, I think that we're going to evaluate the process -- of the nomination process and I don't think it's going to be that easy for them."" ""People in our party are talking about what we're going to do about this. I mean there's a ballot access issue in South Carolina. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is,"" he explained. ""So what's the penalty for that?

1213,"In March, in a bold “Oh yeah?” moment during an interview with the Washington Post’s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper’s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, “I have quite a few more.” The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, “Carter Page, PhD.” Who? Story Continued Below Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump’s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he “will be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.” This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page. “What’s this guy’s name?” says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page. “I had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,” says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. “But I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ‘Have you heard of this guy?’” “Strangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,” Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. “It's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.” Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who’d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with. This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. “I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.” As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn’t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that “Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.”) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like? Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (“I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’” says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump’s own campaign. What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. “He’s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,” says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia’s state oil giant. “People really respect him in this industry. He’s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.” According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials—including Rosneft head Igor Sechin—during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it’s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump. Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his “deep ties” with “executives at Gazprom,” the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with “extensive business interests in Russia” and an office “around the corner from Trump Tower.” Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School’s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the “hypocrisy” of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, “Washington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.” He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a “famous American economist” and “adviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.” All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of “insiders,” people who seem to be in Trump’s orbit but who may not have—and may never have had—any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all. But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate “corporate investigators” digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won’t say who turned him on to Page’s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin’s chief of staff—both of whom are on the sanctions list—when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech. So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page? *** I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn’t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page’s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice. This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed. OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn’t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive résumé. Page’s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the résumé of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. “He spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,” his bio reads. “He was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.” Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page’s tenure in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals. So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn’t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn’t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch’s purported involvement in the deal. “I don’t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,” says Craig . “It closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.” When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page’s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, “I rolled my eyes at that one.” (He, too, said he hadn’t heard of Page until Trump’s announcement.) Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page? Turns out, they did. “His nickname was stranichkin,” from the Russian word stranichka, or “little page,” says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company’s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch’s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. “It really irritated our team,” Torchinsky told me over Skype. “We worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we’d have to correct them. These guys didn’t know what they were talking about.” As for Page, “He made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,” Torchinsky says. “When you’re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.” OK, harsh. But then I talked to Page’s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. “He wasn’t great and he wasn’t terrible,” Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone “without any special talents or accomplishments,” someone who was “a gray spot.” “What can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?” he asked me. Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was “just the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,” says Aleksashenko. When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page “was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.” When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, “mildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.” And, says Aleksashenko, “judging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn’t really understand the topic.” Trump’s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, “did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,” says Aleksashenko. *** For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. “In recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,” he wrote. “Although commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.” He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West’s “New Slaves” and the “artist’s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs” but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (“Slave; Pronunciation: /slāv/…”), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney. His speech in Moscow’s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word “ironically.” “For the last 15 years, I’ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,” he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn’t really speak Russian—he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: “We never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.” Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine. Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. “He had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn’t really want to engage,” one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. “That blog post about the slaves. That’s just … strange,” says the Council member. “He’s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn’t be in the last decile, but he’d be in the second-to-last decile,” says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. “You’d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.” *** I should’ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign’s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump’s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page’s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign. I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page’s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia’s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it? But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch’s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. “No one let him into Gazprom,” Aleksashenko says. “He didn’t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller’s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.” Another of Page’s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page’s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. “People organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,” the former colleague said. “He hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year… I used to do this; it doesn’t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn’t mean they’re close to him.” But the meetings did provide him with something else. “Gazprom didn’t need money at the time,” says the former colleague. “They were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.” Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he’s worked for to invest in them. After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father’s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as “founder and managing partner,” even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address—that’s the one “around the corner from Trump Tower”— which was actually the address of a co-working space. “That’s Carter Page,” says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. “That’s what he’s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he’s been trying to throw together these deals. He’s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.” In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia’s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I don’t know this person,” said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page’s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. “I give them money, I don’t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,” he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, “Don’t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.” “You are engaged in onanism,” said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. “It’s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It’s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It’s absurd.” As for the FBI investigation, well, it’s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is “no prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.” He added, “the story doesn't add up.” What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page’s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, “whether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.” *** I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump’s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page? “Who?” says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign. “He has no formal role in the campaign,” Hope Hicks texted responding to my question. Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks’s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he? One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with. One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump’s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. “The only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,” Burt told me. “And I told him I’d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I’ve forgotten. He’s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?” Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions’ chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump’s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn’t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. “If he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,” this person told me. “I’m not answering your questions,” Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign’s other spokesperson, says, “Carter Page isn’t someone I’ve interacted with.” Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: “Carter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He’s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.” *** Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said—he’s my adviser—and what his associates said—“Who?” Maybe I wasn’t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp. “I don’t know about his Russia fund, other than it’s never really materialized,” says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. “Every conversation I’ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They’ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.” He went on. “I couldn’t name a project that I could connect Carter’s name to, any project that actually happened.” “I don’t know how he’s earned a living off this,” the energy player says, “but I think he’s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it’s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.” Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, “a lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ‘I want to be part of the team,’” says the Trump adviser. And that’s how it happened. “He’s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ‘He’s an adviser.’ And now he’s milking it for all it’s worth.” Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington—or at least could plausibly market himself as one. “I was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,” one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there “in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,” but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen—and be impressed. “He was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,” the Russia specialist recalls. “He didn’t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.” According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page’s trip to Russia, “the meetings did happen and that’s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.” But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. “It’s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?” said the staffer. “Is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America’s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It’s what’s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carré novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?” This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he’s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is—and to try to turn a profit off of that. “If Page using his status as ‘Trump advisor’ for personal gain, that’s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia’s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy—but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: “Carter Page, Ph.D.” Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark. For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference? There doesn’t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin’s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? “I want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,” Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election—as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we’ve finally grasped it.",1,0,0
129,"We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat: .@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016  Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil. Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education. It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening. The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons. Featured image from file",0,1,0
202,"Kansas is bleeding money and jobs and Governor Sam Brownback doesnât want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been. In 2011, the Tea Party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn Kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results. But Brownbackâs experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt, education funding is suffering, and job growth is pathetic. So pathetic that Kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained. In January, Brownback couldnât handle a report put together by his group that admitted âKansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before Brownback became governor,â so he made every effort to cover it up. In other words, he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring, not falling to the ground like a rock. Kansas Center for Economic Growth executive director Heidi Holliday blasted Brownback for killing the report. âHe specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics. Five years later, the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course.â In fact, Brownback is so desperate to keep the people of Kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government. Instead of writing their own independent reports, the group is now restricted to getting their information from the Federal Reserve, which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur. That particularly surprised Kansas House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, who was quick to point out the irony. âThe missed revenue marks, missed job reports, missed projections shed light on his failed policies. I kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed President Obama for our economic problems.â Governor Brownbackâs economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke. Kansasâ economy is now in shambles and Republicans have no one to blame but themselves. They believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from Democrats that they would prove trickle-down economics as a total success. Instead, it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported. By all rights, Brownback should have ousted by voters in 2014. But now Kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years. Meanwhile, the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank. ",0,1,0
25,"With the world watching, President Barack Obama today took an apparent swipe at Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, in his eighth and final address to the United Nations General Assembly as commander in chief. ""Today a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama warned, without naming the Republican presidential nominee. Obama further cautioning against ""the same forces of global integration"" that have made democracies interdependent while exposing ""deep fault lines in the existing international order"" like gaps between the rich and poor created by capitalism throughout the world. He made two other references to the ineffectiveness of walls in stopping global forces, quipping in an apparent reference to the Zika virus that ""mosquitoes don't respect walls"" and saying of terrorism that ""the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies."" Though he never directly addressed the U.S. presidential election, Obama's message for the General Assembly was in many ways applicable to the impulses raging in the race, citing ""a contest between authoritarianism and democracy right now"" and an appeal for a top-down ""strongman model."" Obama rejected such tendencies. ""History shows that strongmen are then left with two paths,"" he said. ""Permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.""     Speaking about the big picture, the Obama recounted the progress made during his presidency, on issues such as the global financial crisis, international terrorism and re-establishing relations with Cuba. ""This is important work,"" he stressed. ""It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together."" Obama said nations ""can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration"" or ""retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion."" ""I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward,"" he said, although he added that doing so would require nations of the world to ""acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction."" ""The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration,"" Obama said. ""Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions — economic, political and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely addressed."" Obama demanded that democracies of the world ""speak out forcefully"" for ""freedom and dignity."" ""A world in which 1 percent of the economy controls the other 99 percent will never be stable,"" he said. ""These are the policies I've pursued in the United States, and with clear results"" — touting progress in job creation, cutting poverty, improving infrastructure and investing in childhood education. His speech came as fighting in Syria has resumed after the Syrian military declared Monday an end to the fragile cease-fire deal that was brokered between the U.S. and Russia just over a week ago. ""Together now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering,"" Obama said. ""There's a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that can do more to offer a hand."" In the same month that North Korea conducted its second nuclear test of the year, Obama highlighted the benefits of free markets over markets resisting influence from globalization. ""We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box, nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, overreliance on national resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they're more likely to lead to conflict,"" he said. ""And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central plan to control the economy is a dead end,"" Obama said.",1,0,0
344,"San Francisco (CNN)Hillary Clinton has moved away from the donor circuit after an August of nonstop fundraising, ceding that role to her running mate Tim Kaine, who's getting some celebrity help as well. Since September 1, Kaine has headlined 25 fundraisers in 12 states and Washington, DC, while Clinton has only held eight. Kaine continued his fundraising blitz on Wednesday in California with multiple events in the Bay Area, including a luncheon featuring two long-time Republican donors. Thursday, he's in Houston for an event that features singer Michael Bolton. This is Bolton's second fundraiser for Clinton; he appeared at an event during the Democratic primaries. The Texas Tribune first reported Bolton's appearance. The Houston event is part of Kaine's cash-raising spree. Kaine appeared Wednesday at the Atherton home of Jillian Manus, a Republican donor, philanthropist and businesswoman. The event will be co-hosted by HP CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for California governor as a Republican in 2010. Whitman endorsed Clinton in August, writing in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton. According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign, Kaine has raised over $16 million in September, as of Wednesday. Clinton has raised around $13 million by the same standard. Clinton also canceled her trip to California earlier this month after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. The change comes after an August where both Clinton and Kaine focused more on fundraising than they did on campaigning. The Democratic duo headlined 70 fundraisers in August (37 for Clinton, 33 for Kaine). The events raised over $80 million, according to CNN's estimate. Clinton aides say that August will be the high-water mark for Clinton personally headlining events. While she will continue to headline events, one aide said more of the load would continue to fall on Kaine. The change is one that donors have long expected and were somewhat surprised it didn't happen in August. Even if Clinton was a more prolific fundraiser in August, Kaine hit the ground running on the fundraising circuit after he was named Clinton's running mate in July. To date, the former Virginia senator has headlined 58 fundraising events and raised closed to $30 million. Clinton still remains a far bigger draw than Kaine, with many of her fundraisers costing tens of thousands of dollars to attend. But Kaine has headlined his share of top dollar fundraisers. An event at the Los Angeles home of Cynthia and Charles Hirschhorn on Tuesday raised $1.4 million. Charles Hirschhorn, a movie producer who worked on ""Bull Durham"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" was housemates with Kaine in their student days at Harvard Law School. On Monday, Kaine headlined a ""Latinos for Hillary"" event at the Los Angeles home of actress Eva Longoria. Kaine also headlined an event Tavern on the Green, the historic New York restaurant in Central Park, where five donors paid a whopping $500,000 to dine with the VP candidate. In all, the intimate event raised $2.5 million. Kaine, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was tapped as Clinton's running mate, in part, because of his ability to raise the money needed to compete in a presidential election. While other factors like his preparedness and ability to win over white working-class voters were key factors in Clinton's decision to pick Kaine, aides said in July that the Virginia senator was the best fundraiser being considered.

883,"After an exhausting day of ruining the lives of everyday Americans, rumor has it Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likes to curl up in his gold-plated bed and relax with a book by his favorite author – Adolf Hitler. Long before Trump began his run for president where racism, bigotry, hatred, division, and fear became the pillars of his campaign he was studying the work of man who is responsible for the third-most murders in human history. According to a 1990 Vanity Fair article written by Marie Brenner, Trump’s ex-wife Ivana, spilled the beans on Trump’s love affair with Hitler: Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. When the pathologically lying Trump was confronted about owning the book he feigned ignorance. The interviewer asked him, “Did your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?” Trump was shocked and attempted to deflect the question by asking a question, “Who told you that?” but he then confirmed he owned the book, “Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of “Mein Kampf”, and he’s a Jew.” That Trump would even admit to owning the book is bad enough, but his justification for owning the book offers a window into his contorted carnival house of mirrors logic. Trump reasons it’s okay to read about Hitler hating Jews, because his Jewish friend gifted it to him, and wouldn’t it be rude to discard the gift without giving it a thorough read? Trump lied about lying, as is his standard fare. Marty Davis did indeed confirm giving Trump the book, but it was Hitler’s “My Jewish Order” not “Mein Kampf.” Whether or not that is worse is up for debate. Davis went on to say he isn’t Jewish, but that he and Trump are friends. Then, likely after realizing he had outed himself as xenophobic towards Jewish people, Trump back peddled claiming even if he had Hitler’s book he wouldn’t read it. Trump said, “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.” What does he mean he’s not saying he has the speeches? He literally confirmed he had them moments earlier! While it is an exercise in one’s gag reflex to picture Trump in bed, it is natural to picture him with a Nazi swastika draped over his headboard, while filling his brain with strategies to bamboozle and terrorize the public. Trump’s campaign has been ripped from Hitler’s playbook of demonizing minorities and blaming them for the ills of a nation, which is all the more reason why Trump must be prevented from winning the presidency in less than seven weeks. If Trump has been studying Hitler for almost 30 years it is too generous of a leap to believe Trump was only interested in Hitler’s rise to power, and in fact will continue to crib Hitler’s strategies if and when he assumes power himself.",0,1,0
450,"Washington (CNN)It is a staple of Donald Trump's stump speech, intended to show that the country is experiencing a frightening crime wave. ""Last year we saw a 17% increase in violent crime in our 50 largest cities,"" he often says. Trump used to say that it was a 17% increase in homicides in the country's 50 largest cities. He now says that increase is in ""violent crimes."" Since Trump does not say what he considers violent crimes, it is difficult to check his figures. A yearly survey conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault and non-fatal shootings increased by about 2% in 65 major jurisdictions. (The chiefs' association list includes large counties such as Los Angeles County and Prince Georges County, Maryland -- outside Washington -- as well as cities such as Pittsburgh, Newark, New Jersey, and Cincinnati that are not among the nation's 50 largest.) But if Trump's claim is that the number of homicides in 2015 was 17% larger than the number of murders in 2014, he is closer to the mark. The major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16% among its members. And a survey of the country's 30 largest cities done by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice indicated an increase in homicides of 14%. But these numbers do not represent an across-the-board increase in homicides for major jurisdictions, nor that an unprecedented wave of killings is hitting virtually all big cities. In fact, only three cities -- Baltimore, Chicago and Washington -- account for more than half of the national increase in murders, according to the Brennan Center survey. If you take those three cities out of the equation, the number of murders only jumped by about 7% in the nation's largest cities. ""I think Trump's figure is more misleading than inaccurate,"" said Inimai M. Chettiar, the director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center. Verdict: True, but misleading. ",1,0,0
1221,"The State Department has found about 5,600 work-related emails relevant to Hillary Clinton in a set turned over by the FBI at the end of its investigation into her private server setup, but it appears only about 10 percent of those will be processed for release to the public in advance of the November election. The pace of release ordered by a federal judge Friday is far slower than the State Department managed last year when it was disclosing as much as 7,000 pages per month from the roughly 54,000 pages of email records Clinton provided to her former agency at the end of 2014. Story Continued Below After a hearing in U.S. District Court, Judge James Boasberg issued an order requiring State to process 1,050 pages of the FBI-discovered email records by the election. They are to emerge publicly in three batches, on Oct. 7 and 21 and Nov. 4. After that, State will continue to produce the emails . At the hearing, Boasberg initially said he would order the processing of 1,050 documents in the case by early November, but he later revised his direction to require only that many pages. State initially proposed processing 250 pages every two weeks, or about 750 pages by the election. The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch urged the judge to put all 5,600 emails out before the election. ""What we are looking for is as much quick turnaround as possible,"" Judicial Watch attorney Lauren Burke said. However, the judge suggested it was ""unrealistic"" to expect all 5,600 messages to be processed in the next six weeks. The judge acknowledged a public interest in getting the records out before voters go to the polls Nov. 8, but he repeatedly expressed sympathy for the challenges State has faced in responding to dozens of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits relating to the emails of Clinton and her top aides. He also said he was reluctant to disrupt processing of records in those other cases. “I think we all need to bear in mind the State Department has other duties beyond FOIA requests,” said Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. “I know the State Department has been working very hard. ... The court can’t jump to the head of the queue.” After the hearing, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said he disagreed with the judge’s ruling. However, Fitton saved his real firepower for the State Department, saying the agency is overseeing “an absolutely corrupt process.” “The State Department is being obstructionist. They have had these records since July and they’ve only released five records,” Fitton said, referring to a smattering of messages released in other cases seeking information on specific topics. “It’s an obvious slow-walking.” A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment, but referred to a statement in which spokesman John Kirby said State “voluntarily agreed” to turn the messages over to Judicial Watch even though they were not in State’s possession at the time of the group’s request. He said the records will be posted on State’s website when they’ve been processed. Justice Department lawyers at Friday’s hearing provided more insight into what the FBI turned over to State. Attorney Lisa Olson said the main disk of recovered Clinton emails contained 15,171 documents, of which more than 60 percent, or over 9,400, were “deemed purely personal” during a recent “appraisal.” That left about 5,600 considered work-related at least in part, she said, although Kirby’s statement said some of those may also be deemed entirely personal after further review. Just how much new information will emerge by the election or thereafter remains unclear, for a variety of reasons. Many of the 5,600 emails are likely to be duplicates or what State calls “near-duplicates” of the ones Clinton already turned over. (State says a “near-duplicate” is an already-processed message with a nonsubstantive notation, like a request to print it out.) Olson said at Friday’s hearing that the duplicates appear to be a “significant” and “substantial” number of the overall set. Another Justice lawyer, Marcia Berman, said she believed a sampling of the 5,600 found “almost half” were duplicates or nearly so. In addition, State could decide to withhold some of the messages in their entirety, in which case they would still count as processed pages even though the public wouldn’t see them. Classified emails are being treated separately. Olson said a set of those records FBI turned over to State appears to be almost entirely duplicative of material State already processed. State could exceed the judge’s order but seems unlikely to proceed much faster given the litany of statements the agency has made about being under-staffed and overburdened by FOIA requests and lawsuits relating to emails exchanged by Clinton and her close aides. There also the possibility another judge handling a related case could order faster production, but the chance of that also seems remote. During Friday’s hearing, Berman said the State Department no longer has the level of staffing in the FOIA section that it did when the agency was cranking out thousands of pages a month from the main set of Clinton emails. “Many of those folks have returned to their regular duties,” Berman said. “There’s been a lot of attrition. It’s a very difficult and demanding job these days ... and not a lot of fun.”",1,0,0

1062,"His wife’s operatives are hunkered down in debate prep, but Bill Clinton is waging a campaign of his own, trying to clear the name of a foundation that has caused controversy in the 2016 race. The former president views the final glitzy meeting of his Clinton Global Initiative — which he will address on Wednesday in an emotional farewell — as his last big opportunity to counter accusations that the philanthropy served as a vehicle for wealthy foreign donors to curry access with his wife’s State Department. Story Continued Below Between his appearances on stage this week, Clinton was still writing the speech; it will be a “personal reflection” on his 15 years at the Clinton Foundation, according to a person familiar with his thinking. He aims to explain how “CGI helped redefine philanthropy.” He also is expected to make an impassioned argument that the foundation has improved lives around the world — a statement he hopes will serve as a powerful rebuke of the controversy that has turned his post-presidential work into a political obstacle for Hillary Clinton, adding to the damaging perception that the Democratic nominee is untrustworthy. Bill Clinton is not expected to mention Donald Trump or even his wife’s campaign, the source said. Instead, he will aim for an optimistic tone and tell the audience that “when you appeal to the best in people, you get the best. And when you appeal to the worst in people, you get the worst.” But with 48 days left in this contest — and voters in focus groups still expressing concern about what they view as inside dealing for foundation donors seeking special access — many Democrats said they were baffled by the former president’s decision to carry on with the conference at all. Trump has seized on the foundation, accusing the Clintons of selling access. And on Monday, the Republican National Committee said the foundation’s “continued acceptance of foreign contributions while [Hillary Clinton] runs for the White House is an unprecedented and unacceptable conflict of interest that undermines her ability to serve.” The foundation in August announced it would no longer accept corporate or foreign contributions if Hillary Clinton wins the White House and that CGI would come to an end regardless of the election outcome. But even allies worried that this year's conference was an unforced error that served only to cede the spotlight to the wrong Clinton just as the Democratic nominee needs to promote her own case to voters. “They would have been better off postponing it this year,” said one member of the Democratic National Committee and a Clinton ally. “The foundation has been a negative this year, with concerns about donors seeking influence and access — why shine light on it right before the debate?” One source close to Bill Clinton said putting it off simply wasn’t an option. ""They had no choice,” the ally said. “These things are set up long in advance and usually get good press. They never thought it would be such a problem.” The former president seemed determined to turn it into an opportunity to change the narrative. Bill Clinton, close allies said, has been furious about what he sees as the “smearing” of his life’s work, the AIDS relief and the global fight on behalf of women’s rights overshadowed by questions of where the foundation gets its money. And both Clintons, sources said, have been frustrated that Hillary Clinton's Brooklyn-based campaign has not done enough to explain the philanthropic work the charity does at home and abroad, or that its mission is moral, not financial. Throughout the week, the former president was determined to use what may be his final solo spotlight to regain the moral high ground. ""In real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and I find out it is [a lie], I like you more and them less,” Bill Clinton told NPR earlier this week. “In political life, if they just keep on smearing you — even if it all comes to nothing — people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say."" Sitting down with CNBC in the middle of the day Tuesday, he added: “I've learned already in this election, some people were just subject to a presumption of guilt just because they were participating.” Hillary Clinton’s campaign went on offense too; it highlighted a Washington Post report that Trump used $258,000 of his foundation’s money for his personal legal defense. “Today has provided a stark contrast between the potentially illegal activities of the Trump Foundation and how the Clinton Foundation is improving millions of lives here in the U.S. and around the world,” said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin. “That's a debate we'll have anytime."" The showcase gathering, held annually at the Sheraton near Times Square, typically brings together Fortune 500 CEOs, world leaders, celebrities and nonprofit leaders — a high-wattage assembly that, this year, runs counter to the current populist mood across the country. Even the snacks served catered to the limousine liberal set; vegan “energy squares” made of fig, hazelnut and cacao nibs, and multigrain crisps smeared with almond butter and maple syrup, were served between “breakout sessions.” While Bono and former Victoria’s Secret model Doutzen Kroes took the stage on the opening day alongside leaders like Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, the event seemed slightly more toned down than in previous years — and in some ways more like a Clinton friends-and-family reunion. Some of the participants from previous years, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, declined invitations this year, a source familiar with the planning said. But former Clinton aide Doug Band attended the opening plenary session. Marjorie Mezvinsky, whose son is married to Chelsea Clinton, flashed iPhone photos of her grandchildren to friends. Stalwart allies including former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards and longtime Clinton friend Melanne Verveer gamely participated in panels, and expressed regret that the organization was winding down. “The decision has been made,” Verveer, a former Clinton White House aide who now heads up the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, said of shutting down CGI. “It’s really bittersweet. There's a sense of nostalgia.” Democrats, meanwhile, have been increasingly incensed at what they see as a double standard applied to the two presidential candidates — especially as more revelations come to light about how Trump ran his own foundation. “No one is saying, ‘Why don’t you put your hotels aside, or your money-making enterprises aside,’” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top aide to President Barack Obama. “For Hillary Clinton, for some reason, helping deal with AIDS in Africa is something that should be put aside.” From the stage, at least, Bill Clinton was careful not to go down the political, or defensive, road. When London Mayor Sadiq Khan tried to bait him into discussing Trump — “It’s no coincidence that some of those involved in the Brexit campaign are involved in another campaign taking place somewhere else this November,” Khan said — Clinton smiled but kept his mouth shut. Instead, he spent most of his time on stage doing what he can’t do at campaign rallies for his wife: talking at length about his own presidency and his own views of the world. “In my home, I have two beautiful, highly unique samples of large rocks that came out of Bosnia,” he said during one panel. “It’s one of the most geologically interesting places on earth.” Even if the discussion was about old rocks, there was a sense of anxiety hanging over the conference. When asked how she felt about the tightening polls, Verveer winced. “Fingers crossed,” she said.",1,0,0

It would be the first Congressional override of a veto of Barack Obama’s presidency.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said: “As we’ve made this case, members of Congress in both parties have indicated that they are open to the concerns that we’ve expressed. In many cases, they share them.

But they saw no point in publicizing it. From Miami to Houston, Crawford to Kennebunkport, members of the Republican Party’s first family remained quiet for months, avoiding cameras and questions about presidential politics and focusing their few fundraiser appearances on assisting the GOP candidates who would be forced to share the November ballot with a nominee they detest. But given the Bush clan’s proximity to public life, and their progeny’s desire to one day return the family to power, it was only a matter of time before their tongues would be held no longer. Over a 24-hour span that began with Jeb Bush’s surprising and sardonic cameo in Sunday’s Emmy Awards broadcast and Monday night’s reports that his father, former President George H.W. Bush, had told a family friend privately that he intended to support Hillary Clinton, the Bushes returned to the headlines, and are giving Trump just the establishment foil he so capably exploits … “George W. Bush, who is headed to Washington this weekend to headline a fundraiser for Senate Republicans and attend the opening of the National African American History Museum, has shared in private settings for months about his fear that he will be ‘the last Republican president.’ And while Bush family loyalists say they do not know if he is joking, they are certain he cannot support Trump.” http://politi.co/2clDmMH GOVT FUNDING WATCH -- “Senate advances budget deal that doesn’t exist yet,” by Ben Weyl, Seung Min Kim, and Burgess Everett: “Mitch McConnell summoned his Republican Conference to a late afternoon meeting Tuesday with an unusual ask: Would his colleagues support moving forward on a spending deal that doesn’t even exist yet? The answer, surprisingly, was yes. The Senate voted 89-7 on Tuesday evening to move forward on a bill that will eventually be used to fund the government through Dec. 9 and deliver $1.1 billion to fight the Zika epidemic. A bloc of conservatives voted no, but the measure easily cleared the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster, powered by votes from Senate Democrats, centrist Republicans and GOP senators up for reelection.” http://politi.co/2cHpBy4 TERRORISM LATEST -- “Bomb suspect vowed ‘death to your oppression,’ feds say,” by AP’s Eric Tucker, Larry Neumeister and Jennifer Peltz: “Federal court complaints filed Tuesday gave a chilling glimpse into what authorities say motivated the Afghan-born U.S. citizen to set off explosives last weekend in New York City and New Jersey, including a bomb that injured 31 people in Manhattan.

401,"Washington (CNN)Eight days before a critical deadline, congressional negotiations over government funding stalled Thursday, prompting Senate Republicans to force a vote on a bill that Democrats warned they would reject. The GOP gambit came after months of talks between the two parties and raises doubts about the ability of Congress to pass a bill before the September 30 deadline, when the government could shut down. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, went to the Senate floor and announced the GOP would drop several thorny issues -- known as ""riders"" -- that still need to be resolved. The tactic was designed to pressure Democrats to accept what McConnell called a ""clean"" government funding bill. ""There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that's what I've just offered. It's the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle,"" McConnell said when he filed the GOP bill. ""It's a fair proposal that funds all current government operations through December 9."" The GOP proposal was immediately panned by Democrats because it left out funds for Flint, Michigan, where the drinking water supply was poisoned by lead in the past year. If the chamber's 46 Democrats stick together, they can block the bill from advancing. ""We are now down to a handful of issues, but they are down to the real issues. Now the Republican leader, the majority leader, has filed a Republican-only bill,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ""We Democrats cannot vote for that."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the Republican proposal, saying ""it falls very short."" Pelosi said Democrats objected to the way Republicans offset the money directed at Zika and said the riders Republicans were pushing showed they have ""a tin ear."" On Thursday night, however, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson became the first Democrat to publicly say he will support the bill because it offers Zika funding, a priority for his state. The turn of events was somewhat unexpected as leaders in each party had signaled for days they were close to a deal and didn't anticipate a real threat of a government shutdown, just weeks before the election. With the balance of power in the Senate at stake, GOP leaders are anxious to complete their work and send their vulnerable members home to campaign. They also want to demonstrate to voters they can govern effectively and deserve to remain in power. House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the back-and-forth between the parties over the must-pass bill to avoid another re-run of the 2013 shutdown, saying ""our members realize that we want to get our work done. We don't want to have high drama around here this time."" Ryan said members aren't necessarily pleased that they will have to vote for a short-term funding bill, but recognize that is the option they ultimately have to back to avoid a shutdown. ""There's never no drama around here -- we're going to have low drama and our members want that,"" Ryan said. In addition to funding the government at current levels for the next three months, the measure offered by McConnell includes $1.1 billion to combat Zika, $500 million to respond to flooding in Louisiana and elsewhere, and $37 million to tackle the widening opioid epidemic through the recently enacted Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. McConnell called the $500 million for flooding a ""down payment"" suggesting additional money would be approved soon. Democrats dispute the bill has that much money in it for opioids. A handful of unresolved and controversial riders were dropped from the bill. One would have forced a delay in turning authority over Internet domain names to an international consortium -- something Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, oppose. Others dealt with how the Export-Import Bank functions and truck driver fatigue. The decision to drop the riders had immediate implications as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said he would not vote for the measure without the Export-Import Bank provision, which is important to his state. Despite moving forward without Democrats, a top Senate GOP leadership aide said Republicans are still open to continuing talks to resolve differences. McConnell said there would have the next four days to consider the bill before any votes take place. In the meantime, neither chamber is expected to be in session until next week. ",1,0,0
1163,"A day after autocratic Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he had “no doubt” Donald Trump would make a strong leader, the Republican nominee returned the favor, praising Sisi as a “fantastic guy.” Sitting down with Fox Business’ Lou Dobbs, Trump touted the “chemistry” the two politicians shared during a special meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly Monday. Story Continued Below “I thought it was very productive. He’s a fantastic guy,” Trump said of Sisi. “I thought it was a great meeting. We met for a long time, actually. There was a good chemistry there. You know when you have good chemistry with people. There was a good feeling between us.” Trump also praised the foreign leader’s handling of the Egyptian coup d’etat of 2013 that removed former President Mohamed Morsi from power, a bloody transition that saw thousands of dissidents and protesters killed. “He took control of Egypt. And he really took control of it,” Trump said. Days prior, Trump lavished Sisi with praise, expressing support for the leader’s “strong support for Egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Trump has faced heavy criticism for praising authoritarian leaders like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. In an interview with CNN Thursday, Sisi expressed confidence in Trump’s leadership in light of their recent meeting. Asked by host Erin Burnett whether he shared a similar positive outlook of Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, Sisi showed similar confidence. “Political parties in the United States would not allow candidates to reach that level unless they are qualified to lead a country the size of the United States of America,” Sisi replied.",1,0,0
765,"Eric Trump has had enough of Hillary Clinton, as we all are, but the difference is, he’s doing something about it by speaking out and making his voice heard. Erichas been one of the most vocal of the Trump family, outside of Donald of course, when it comes to the lying shrew known as Hillary Clinton. Thi,s weekend he called in to Judge Jeanine Pirro’s show and absolutely DESTROYED her on the topic of being fit to lead. Listen below and cheer along with me and he dismantles every lie Hillary has ever said, exposing the worst nightmare for Hillary voters – the cold, hard truth. “Hard-working Americans feel totally left behind by Washington, D.C.,” Eric Trump said on Justice. “We lost one-third of all our manufacturing jobs. I find it ironic that Hillary spends her life in Los Angeles or the Hamptons [N.Y.]…doing fundraisers” while the elder Trump holds public rallies that draw more the “15 thousand people,” he said. Trump said his father has been preparing for some time, but “not by memorizing cue cards”. He “speaks with very intelligent people,” he said. He also said Clinton is the definition of someone “unfit” to be commander-in-chief. “Unfit is deleting emails and lying to the Department of Justice and lying to Congress. Unfit is running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American charitable history,” Trump said.  Absolutely RIGHT!

219,"If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, youÂ already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. Letâs just say that everyone noticed. Trump couldnât take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliationÂ that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would). The best excuse Trump hasÂ been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being âwrong with it,â that micÂ seemed to work fine as he shouted over HillaryÂ every few seconds.Â AP reported: âTrump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said, âThey gave me a defective mic!âÂ He said he âwonder(s), was that on purpose?ââ CBSâsÂ Sopan DebÂ also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into Trumpâs microphone conspiracy theory: Twitter Trump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trump didnât prepare for the debate like Clinton did â and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldnât have mattered much â heâs completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, HillaryÂ showed America that these two shouldnât even be up against each other. There is no comparison. HillaryÂ looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter whoÂ should have never made it up on that stage. I wouldnât be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromisedÂ last night. ",0,1,0

One person who seems to being doing this very well is none other than Dixie Chicksâ Natalie Maines. As a woman whoâs never shied away from letting her opinion be known about politicians, Maines began by taking to Twitter to make a joke about her apparent issues with airline travel saying that sheâll vote for whoever makes the airline industry decent again.

""Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user?"" Dean, a physician and former Vermont governor, tweeted. Some Clinton supporters took pleasure in what appeared to be a minor ailment, especially after Trump and his allies have floated conspiracy theories that the former secretary of state is suffering from chronic health conditions.

724,"The first presidential debate between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is scheduled to take place Monday, September 26. Moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, the debate will take place at Long Island’s Hofstra University. The format will be a 90-minute program without commercial breaks. Personally, I have to admit that I can’t wait to see the real estate magnate and the former secretary of state engage in a verbal boxing match. Apparently, I am not alone. The first Trump-Clinton face off is anticipated by experts to draw “as many as 100 million viewers – reaching almost as many people as the Super Bowl.” Barack Obama’s first debate with Mitt Romney in 2012, garnered over 70 million viewers, which was the highest number for a debate since 1980 when 80.6 million viewers tuned in to watch President Jimmy Carter debate Republican presidential candidate, Ronald Reagan. The reasons for the unprecedented interest are apparent. The 2016 presidential race has been patently different from any presidential campaign in recent history. First of all, the race is incredibly close. Clinton only has an aggregate lead of 3 points over Trump in the national race. However, Trump currently has the lead in several battleground states including  Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.  On the most basic level, the two candidates who have been called everything from the “most polarizing” to the “least-liked” candidates in history are also the most interesting. In the Democratic corner, you have Hillary Clinton, the woman who has spent most of her adult life in politics and arguably has been aspiring to the presidency for over 20 years. You only have to read her college thesis to see that the seeds of her ambition were already germinating on the Wellesley campus. Obviously, Clinton also brings to the arena not only her past history as a former  first lady, former senator and former secretary of state, she also brings a suite of scandals involving her use of an unsecured email server during her tenure at the State Department, quid for quo dealings involving the Clinton Foundation etc. In the Republican corner, you have Donald Trump, a real estate billionaire whose last name has graced everything from hotels to ties. Trump also deepened his fame by becoming a reality show creator and star with his now legendary show “The Apprentice.” One could argue that being a reality star was the perfect training ground for diving into the fishbowl called politics. The debate‘s anticipated high ratings are also predicated on the assumption that everyone wants to witness the dynamics between Clinton and Trump in a one on one conversation format. We have heard a lot about their different styles of debate preparation. Supposedly, Trump has been studying videos of  Clinton to better understand her body language and facial gestures. Clinton has been  reportedly using her long time aide Philippe Reines as the “Trump” stand-in during mock debate sessions. It will be interesting to see what happens when these two individuals who have been spending the last few months attacking each other indirectly via media interviews, campaign rallies and tweets actually get into the same room. When was the last time that happened? January 22, 2005, the day of Donald Trump’s marriage to Melania Knauss? Yes, that’s right Bill and Hill were guests at the Donald’s third nuptial ceremony. Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of speculation about Mrs. Clinton’s health and whether she is physically capable of serving as president. Her recent fainting episode at the 15th anniversary of the September 11thattacks (which has been since explained as a reaction to pneumonia) has been feeding the “bad health” rumors which have been circulating since her 2012 concussion. Most recently, the speculation has deepened with theories covering everything from Parkinsons to a neurological problem. It has not helped the situation that Mrs. Clinton has also had public instances where she appeared physically unstable or in need of assistance mounting stairs. And of course, most recently a video has circulated of Mrs. Clinton addressing a largely union audience where she asked the rhetorical question of why she isn’t 50 points ahead of Donald Trump in the race. More than one pundit has described her demeanor in this video as “unhinged.” As for Mr. Trump, critics point to situations where he spoke bluntly such as saying that we need to bar all Muslims from entering the United States until we have a mechanism for vetting them. He also famously received a lot of criticism for his early remarks that some of the Mexicans entering the United States illegally are “rapists and drug dealers.”  Many viewers may tune in to see if Trump will put his foot in his mouth. Many will approach the debate with this perspective despite the fact that for the last two months Trump has been vigorously campaigning, delivering one policy speech after another while staying very much on message. Of course, the whole point of a presidential debate is for the candidates to have an opportunity to showcase their platforms to the American people. Obviously, their ability to effectively answer the moderator’s questions within the confines of a designated time frame and other guidelines are part and parcel of the debate. While viewers may be intrigued by the spectacle, they are also interested in hearing more about the issues. While we have heard a lot about Trump’s policies, we have not heard as much about Clinton’s.  Although, this week we did hear that she plans to impose a 65% estate tax on the wealthiest individuals. I am sure people may want to hear more about that. Also, media bias has played a huge role in the campaign. Many people may be tuning to see if Lester Holt will be a fair moderator. Of course, the primary reason people are tuning in to the debate is that the winner of the debate may very well become the winner of the election for  the US presidency. After all, the race is all about who has the best vision, the best plan and the likelihood of ultimately delivering the best results for the American people.

1479,"The United Kingdom began construction on what is being called their “great wall” near the border at Calais, France. The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds — about $2.5 million — and will be approximately 13 feet high.   There is a nearby migrant camp called “the Jungle” that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom. The wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences. The “Jungle” now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. Police have called that area of Calais a “no-go” zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.   It is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. “This wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,” he said. “We can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.” Liberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump. However, they don’t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. Thankfully, the British government, along with the French, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue.

1589,"Black Lives Matter released their platform last month that calls for defunding police departments, race-based reparations, voting rights for illegal immigrants, fossil-fuel divestment, an end to private education and charter schools, a “universal basic income” and free college for blacks. Based on this platform it is obvious that ‘black people’ don’t have parents or families to teach them how to take care of themselves and their own needs.   Based on that ‘platform’ it comes as no surprise that Black Lives Matter got upset when an unofficial BLM chapter held a protest that turned into a cookout with the local police. The BLM made sure to denounce the chapter and event immediately:  THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL #BlackLivesMatter CHAPTER! THIS IS NOT IN LINE WITH OUR PRINCIPLES. @Blklivesmatter https://t.co/IIlnTbgE1S — BlackLivesMatter DC (@DMVBlackLives) July 20, 2016   Trying to heal the wounds of a nation and come together by working together is NOT the goal of Black Lives Matter. In their tweet and many conversations about the event thereafter, they have revealed that their goal is destruction. They want to rip apart America by creating a divide between races which is essentially the goal of their major donor, George Soros. Soros is known for disrupting the economies of nations to profit from the unrest. This is why the major Black Lives Donor has given at least $33 Million in grants to Black Lives Matter through his Open Society Foundation and from the Center For American Progress. Soros funded political movement, Occupy Wallstreet, didn’t have the bones and anger to rip apart America because it was a bunch of people who don’t want to work. But the black community is a huge part of the thread of what is America. Soros’ attempt to create a massive racial divide between ‘white and black’ on the backs of familial deaths in the black community and blaming it on society instead of the individual looks like a winning movement. To disallow communities to try and heal that divide is contrary to Soros’ plan. What happened in the Wichita, Kansas community was an attempt to close that divide. KSNW, the NBC affiliate station covering the area, said that the event, which was hosted by the Sunflower Community Action group, wasn’t just a lighthearted celebration — it was a way for the community to reach out to its police department to discuss issues surrounding police-community relations. The Wichita Eagle reported that “At one table, three men – a black man, a Hispanic man and a white man – sat down with burgers next to Lt. Travis Rakestraw to share their ideas.” Black Lives Matter later responded to their initial tweet that the event was against BLM principles saying, “Our statement about BLM BBQ’s with police was a direct response to the tons of people and orgs who were upset by the event. We assured folks our principles were still focused on dismantling the system.” Dividing people by race, gender, age and religion is the key to dismantling the system. The ‘cops’ are the enforcers of ‘the system’ which is called RULE OF LAW. Without rule of law you will have dismantled the melting pot that is America. Who will survive the anarchy that Black Lives Matter are working for? Who is most likely to lose out? Inner-cities are most likely to lose out if anarchy replaces rule of law.  To end police brutality you have to end the police. — Brotha B (@BlakeDontCrack) July 22, 2016   ",0,0,1
302,"Washington (CNN)The number of individuals who were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted citizenship is far higher than was initially reported by media covering the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's office report on the matter. On Monday, the Inspector General reported that 858 individuals from ""special interest countries"" -- meaning countries that are considered to be ""of concern to the national security"" of the US -- were supposed to have been deported but were instead granted US citizenship. But the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country. A reason for the underplaying of the number may have been the report's focus, which was whether the US Citizenship and Immigration Services was using digital fingerprints effectively. The Inspector General determined that the agency granted citizenship to 858 individuals who had been ordered deported or removed under another identity but ""their digital fingerprint records were not available"" during the naturalization process. But a footnote on page one of the report also states that there were, as of November 2015, an additional 953 individuals about whom the Inspector General couldn't determine if there was a problem with the fingerprint records specifically, but also should have been deported. This other group consisted of members of a slightly broader classification, from countries of concern as well as from neighboring countries where there is a history of fraud. That amounts to a total of 1,811 individuals granted citizenship who should not have been. The Department of Homeland Security responded to the report, saying it would review all 1,811 individuals ""out of an abundance of caution."" Monday's report drew condemnation from many Republicans in Congress, including Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, who said ""a bureaucracy that blunders so badly is one that doesn't take our national security seriously."" The White House said Tuesday it's ""clear"" some systems need improving following a glitch with DHS' fingerprint system that led to hundreds of people inadvertently being granted citizenship. ""It's clear there needs to be an improvement in terms of digitizing some of the fingerprint records,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. ""Additional progress would have been made if additional resources had been appropriated by Congress."" He said the Obama administration ""certainly takes seriously the consideration that is made in terms of protecting our national security in terms of our immigration system.""

230,"During Monday nightâs presidential debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of screwing thousands of his workers out of the wages that they owe him. It was a shining moment for Clinton, that highlighted how Trumpâs entire fortune comes from not his business savvy, but his unending greed and eagerness to exploit anyone he can. Before saying that she is glad that Trump never did business with father, she directly told Trump that he needed to apologize to all those he hurt, saying: âDo the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that theyâve produced and then refused to pay them?â One of those people that Trump stiffed over is an architect named Andrew Tesoro. Tesoro sat down for an interview on , where he revealed how Trump did not pay him the $100,000 dollars that were owed to him for helping to a clubhouse at one of Trumpâs many golf courses. Tesoro was asked whether he was paid for the work he had done on the clubhouse. He responded by saying: âNo, he didnât. He paid partially along the way and the project snowballed over a four year period and our role in the project snowballed as well. We became very much involved in interior design and construction stage work. We made many supplemental agreements as we went along and in the end those agreements were not honored.â Because Trump will do anything to distance himself from his fraudulent business practices, he recently asserted that Tesoro probably wasnât paid because of shoddy work. That comment should really be biting him in the ass now. Thatâs because Tesoro revealed that Trump had written him a letter of recommendation in 2006. In the letter, Trump praised Tesoro for his work. Tesserâs experience is not unique. It seems like every day that more people are coming out in droves and exposing the various ways that Trump has royally screwed them over. One report has been particularly damning. found that Trump has been involved in over 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. They also found that he has left everyone from cabinetmakers to carpenters left without being paid in full, or on time. While those numbers certainly make it easier to understand how far reaching Trumpâs fraudulent practices are, hearing it from someone who was a victim of them makes it so much more real. You can watch Tesoro expose Trump for scam artist in his own words below.  ",0,1,0
45,"While Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump prepare for their first debate on Monday, aides in both their campaigns are expressing concern over how it will all go down. The Trump campaign’s major concern: the candidate’s limited preparation. The Clinton camp’s biggest worry: that the Republican presidential nominee will be asked softer questions than Clinton. “My biggest concern continues to be a low bar set for him on expectations,” Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters during a flight to Orlando, Florida, today, referring to the debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, on Sept. 26 — the first of three face-offs between the two White House hopefuls. “People accommodate the questions and lower the bar on their questions to suit the candidate in front of them, and that’s what’s happened with Trump in the past. And they ask Hillary Clinton a set of much harder questions,” Palmieri said. “They ask him a set of easier questions because he has not put forward detailed ... material you can parry him on.” Her concern stems from what the campaign considers to have been unfair treatment of Clinton during a recent NBC News national security forum that featured both candidates fielding questions from a moderator and audience members in separate segments. Clinton has been preparing for the debate for weeks, and she has no public campaign events planned for the rest of the week so she can continue studying. Aides say the former secretary of state — who is known for doing her homework — has been poring over briefing books and practicing in mock debates with a Trump stand-in. She has been studying footage of Trump’s past debates. From this, Palmieri said, they believe the Republican nominee tends to do better in multicandidate settings, where he can hang back and pick his moments. The campaign is also concerned about Trump’s unpredictable nature. “You’re not sure who is going to show up. He may be aggressive or laid back,” Palmieri said. And while it is common for campaigns to lower expectations before debates and other high-profile events, sources told ABC News that Trump’s preparation for the 90-minute one-on-one battle has been slim — so much so that his senior staff has become concerned about his lack of focus. While Trump has boasted that he will win Monday’s debate, senior sources said he has not delved into policy or participated in mock debates. During his Sunday meetings in Bedminster, New Jersey — where he huddles with campaign chief Steve Bannon, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, Roger Ailes and other advisers, including members of his family — the prep has become more of a discussion of topics and themes and not specific in nature. (Those sessions often become storytelling sessions rather than actual, intense preparation, according to senior sources.) Trump, sources said, was given an iPad loaded with footage of old Clinton debates. Unlike Clinton, who is spending almost the entire rest of the week preparing for Monday, Trump has a busy campaign schedule this week, with no large blocks of time carved out for debate prep. Aides said his debate sessions planned for this weekend have been moved to Trump Tower in New York City, away from his Bedminster estate and golf course, to help him focus. The Trump campaign recently added a Saturday evening event in Roanoke, Virginia. ABC News’ Tom Llamas and John Santucci contributed to this report. ",1,0,0
168,"Since the Reagan administration, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free. Now, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trumpâs children wonât be happy. Previously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, sheâs borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive taxâmeaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estatesâwith a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances. Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away. In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years. Source: Slate As it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes. The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are âdouble taxationâ (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasnât been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed. Of course, even if Clinton is elected, sheâll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants Trumpâs kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes. ",0,1,0
348,"Washington (CNN)The Senate Wednesday rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion United States arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Critics of the military deal, which was approved by the Obama administration last month, complained it could drag the US into the Saudi-led war in Yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis there. The measure to disapprove the sale failed on a 26-71 vote. The outcome, which was a victory for Saudi Arabia, came as the US-Saudi relationship is being carefully examined and managed by restive lawmakers. Congress will vote in the coming days in favor of another highly sensitive matter the Saudis strongly oppose. Lawmakers are expected to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would allow victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist strikes to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in them. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky, aware of the potentially conflicting signals Congress is sending the Saudis, cited the importance of strong US-Saudi ties in explaining why he voted against the blocking the sale. ""I oppose that motion because I believe it would harm our nation's long term strategic interests in the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East,"" he said. ""It would further damage our alliance and partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at a time when our moderate Sunni Arab allies are questioning whether our nation is able to meet our traditional commitment to the region. The resolution would also ignore the shared interests we have with Saudi Arabia in combatting al Qaeda and ISIL."" A coalition of liberal and conservative senators pushed the resolution to scrap the sale. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, argued that by selling tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia the US is essentially joining the war in Yemen without congressional authorization. ""We are complicit and actively involved with war in Yemen. There's been no debate in Congress, really no debate in the public sphere, over whether or not we should be at war in Yemen,"" Paul said. ""We are currently doing inflight refueling of bombers, Saudi Arabian bombers that are bombing in Yemen. We are helping to select sites and we actually have had Special Forces involved in these decisions in the theatre as well."" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, warned America would be blamed for humanitarian disaster in Yemen and could lead to a backlash against the US. ""There have already been thousands and thousands of civilians killed,"" said Murphy. ""If you talk to Yemenis, they will tell you that this is perceived inside Yemen as not a Saudi-led bombing campaign, which it's broadly advertised in the newspapers, but as a US bombing campaign or at best a US-Saudi bombing campaign. There is a US imprint on every civilian death inside Yemen, which is radicalizing the people this country against the United States."" Senior GOP senators active in foreign policy matters -- such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, opposed blocking the sale. They argued that a strong Saudi Arabia provides a critical counterweight to the aspirations of Iran in the Middle East. ""The Middle East is a very complicated place,"" Graham said. ""But here's what's not complicated: Saudi Arabia shared intelligence with us that's made Americans safe. They have allowed us to use their air bases in time of conflict. They are all-in against ISIS and they are a great ally against the ambitions of the Iranians. To those who wish to sever the this relationship, be careful what you wish for."" ",1,0,0
158,"If there is one thing you can say about Trump supporters, it is that they are sure about what they don’t know. And what they don’t know can fill volumes, as evidenced by the latest conversation with some of them, shared on the September 20 episode of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. You can’t blame these people for some of the conspiracy theories they believe — many of those theories started in right-wing media, like Fox News. But when asked, many Trump voters were willing to offer up their own ideas about conspiracies that go far and beyond what even Sean Hannity would probably touch. Reporter Jordan Klepper visited Trump rallies to talk to the attendees and what they told him will make you laugh at first –then it just might make you cry. Trump famously said that he loves the “poorly educated” and Klepper found them in abundance as they waited to hear from their god-emperor. The first couple of people Klepper talks to were interested in rumors about Hillary’s health. One man tells him that he thinks she has AIDS, which she got from Bill. And where did Bill get it? “From messing with that Magic Johnson,” the man replies. We assume he meant the former NBA star and not the ex-president’s, er, “johnson.” It doesn’t take Klepper long to find people who appear to be totally divorced from reality. Like the man who believes Clinton has a body double, and when shown two identical photos of the candidate by Klepper, he quickly and confidently picks out the one he thinks is the “double.” Then there’s the guy who says President Obama reveals he is a Muslim by the way he wears his jewelry. He is referring to a long debunked story that claimed that the president stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring in observance of Ramadan. But there’s no restriction prohibiting Muslims from wearing jewelry during the holy month, except in this man’s mind. So the president appearing sans watch and wedding ring proves absolutely nothing. But the winner is the guy who claimed that Hillary has AIDS, for his demand to know why President Obama wasn’t in the Oval Office when the World Trade Center was attacked on September 11, 2001.

Regardless of who they were with, the reporters went through multiple security sweeps and, at one point, ordered to wait behind a divider. ""Because of our positioning, we were unable to see HRC when she arrived, as previously noted, and without our phones we couldn’t keep track of time,"" the pool report notes. Sisi, a former general, took power in Egypt in 2013 after massive popular protests forced out the elected government of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. During his session with Clinton, which lasted more than an hour, Sisi at one point said he wished to talk “about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."" But Sisi is increasingly viewed as a serial human rights violator. Clinton's decision to meet with him signifies the importance the U.S. places on its alliance with Egypt, a relatively stable country in a chaotic Middle East. But she's already drawn criticism from both liberals and conservatives for sitting down with Sisi.",1,0,0
1266,"President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference. The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments. Story Continued Below “What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.” “That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added. The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day. Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets. “Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”",1,0,0
480,"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama ignored his own ""no hats"" edict Monday when he partook in a traditional American Indian ceremony in Washington. Appearing at the White House's Tribal Nations conference, Obama was wrapped in a wool blanket and crowned with a straw hat as a show of honor. Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said the blanket was called ""Rhythm of the Land."" He said there was a blanket set aside for first lady Michelle Obama as well. As members from different tribes played drums and shakers, Obama smiled and faced an audience comprised of representatives from the 567 federally recognized tribes that were invited to attend. He removed the hat after 20 seconds or so as the ceremony proceeded. ""What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,"" Obama said afterward, calling the event ""very moving"" and a reflection of the friendships he's developed among tribal communities. An embroidered inscription on the blanket gave Obama's Crow namesake, ""Black Eagle,"" and a description: ""Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuxshish,"" or ""One Who Helps People Throughout the Land."" A label identified the blanket as a product of the Pendleton Woolen Mills line. ""I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn't steal mine,"" he said. ""She would, too!"" Obama used his remarks to highlight his efforts toward improving conditions on reservations, including bolstering schools and advancing medical care. The President has typically been wary of donning any headwear besides a baseball cap -- a political lesson he imparted during an appearance at the White House in 2013. ""Here's the general rule: You don't put stuff on your head if you're president. That's politics 101,"" he said when presented with a football helmet from the US Naval Academy. ""You never look good wearing something on your head."" ",1,0,0
551,"“Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people.” —Dan Stein, President of FAIR In a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), they have charged that the Obama administration “grossly misrepresented – by almost tenfold” the number of crimes that were committed by illegal, criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014. Now, if the term “illegal, criminal aliens” sounds like overkill, understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united States illegally, which makes them criminals. However, applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated, but not deported. “In response to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015, ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released, instead of deported, in FY 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses,” read FAIR’s press release. “However, the ICE records that were requested by The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) on FAIR’s behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288. It is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions. Thus, the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ICE turned loose is likely significantly greater.” “The criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ICE’s self-declared ‘priorities’ for removal,” the press release added. “The list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ICE did not deem worthy of deportation in FY 2014 includes: homicide, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, drunk driving, and other offenses. Yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes, ICE doubled down in FY 2015—releasing nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals.” “In recent years, the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted, despite ample funds to remove many more. As a result of Obama administration policies that place protection of illegal aliens—including criminals—over the safety of the American public, thousands of people have been needlessly victimized,” charged Dan Stein, president of FAIR. “Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people,” added Stein. “Moreover, despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing, DHS scrapped the Secure Communities program designed to allow ICE to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police.” “Congress has to act. It is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain,” Stein concluded. In March of 2015 Freedom of Information Act Documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the US by Homeland Security. They were not deported. In fact, so-called “sanctuary cities” released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported, but never were. In 2014, it was also reported the administration released 75% of illegals rather than deport them. It appears to me that DHS needs to be renamed the Department of Homeland IN-Security.

1148,"Ted Cruz is in a bind when it comes to Donald Trump: Loyalists say he should stand by his epic non-endorsement in Cleveland. But Republicans pushing to finally unify the party as the election tightens say it’s time for Cruz to get on board. Cruz hasn’t ruled out an endorsement and is still watching how Trump’s campaign performs down the homestretch, an aide said. But there is a renewed urgency after his former campaign manager told reporters this week that Cruz is warming to Trump’s more disciplined campaign. Cruz himself praised Trump for backing the Texas senator’s crusade to stop a handover of an Internet domain overseer to international regulators. Story Continued Below “If Ted Cruz wants to call himself a Republican I think he should be at least a part of the team. It looks awfully self-serving for not endorsing Donald Trump at this time,” said Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.). “You’re on the same team, so you don’t sit on the bench and sulk because you didn’t get the starting job. If he wants to be called on in the future, he needs to show some character.” “It would be helpful,” said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm. “If I were in Ted Cruz’s position, I would have gone ahead and made the case that of the choices available, Mr. Trump is far and away the best.” Cruz, of course, did exactly the opposite at the Republican convention, drawing boos and jeers from partisans after he urged delegates to “vote your conscience.” It may have made him enemies among Trump supporters, but it also endeared him to those who have flocked to Cruz and his brand of “principled conservatism.” Former aides said they would be crushed if Cruz suddenly came around to Trump after taking so much heat and refusing to back down. “If Cruz's conscience didn't allow him to support Trump at the convention, I don't see any evidence that Trump has changed his behavior to allow Cruz's conscience to support Trump now,” said Amanda Carpenter, a former speechwriter and communications director for Cruz in the Senate. Rick Tyler, who ran Cruz’s press shop during much of his presidential run, said that despite the pressure from Republicans, Cruz will be “done” if he endorses Trump. ""There is no negative future stemming from his defense of conservatism speech in Cleveland,” Tyler said in an email. “Either Trump loses and the speech is cast in a new light; OR Trump wins and is a terrible President and the speech is again cast in a new light; OR Trump wins and is a great president, serves 2 terms and everyone forgets it.” Privately, some Republicans interpreted former campaign manager Jeff Roe’s comments on Wednesday at a Bloomberg event as laying the groundwork for an eventual endorsement of Trump. And hours later, Trump joined Cruz’s latest legislative effort aimed at keeping U.S. authority over Internet domain names. Cruz offered his appreciation on Twitter for Trump's support, and Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reciprocated with her own appreciation of Cruz. Cruz met privately with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence last week and emerged calling Pence a “strong conservative.” But Cruz hasn’t done much else to indicate publicly he'll be voting for Trump over Hillary Clinton. And Cruz is not alone among Senate Republicans: The likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona,, Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Dean Heller of Nevada have all either declined to offer an endorsement of anyone or said outright they won’t vote for Trump. But none carries the kind of political weight Cruz does — not to mention the millions of followers. “Mr. Trump is our nominee and Sen. Cruz represents a big electoral state and is very popular in Texas,” said Texas Rep. Joe Barton. “It certainly would be helpful, I think, for the Trump campaign to have Cruz’s endorsement. Cruz has begun to fundraise for his colleagues and transferred $100,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, important bridges toward his colleagues in the cliquey Senate. But some GOP senators said Cruz finds himself caught between a party he wants to lead and a faction of the GOP that would never forgive him, including prominent conservatives like radio host Steve Deace, who said on Wednesday that ""if someone with Cruz's moxie can't hold the line in the GOP it can't be done. So just burn it down"" It’s potentially a no-win situation that Republicans are sympathetic to. “If you look at the position he’s in, let’s say Donald Trump wins: Probably not good for Ted Cruz. Donald Trump loses: Probably not good for Ted Cruz,” said a Republican senator. “It’s a big liability.” Moreover, Cruz’s potential foe in his 2018 reelection race, Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), spent the week picking at Cruz’s vulnerability on Trump. He said Cruz's position makes him ""very angry."" “What he did at the convention turned off a lot of people. He pledged to support [Trump]. He broke his word,” McCaul said on the Laura Ingraham show. A month ago, the terrain looked different for Cruz. Trump was lagging behind Clinton and Republicans were preparing for a blowout, making Cruz less culpable for blame given the widespread belief that Trump himself was the problem. But now the election is close and polls show Trump surging in swing states. Republicans say Cruz’s support could help put Trump over the top and help solidify his position in states that he won in the primary like Colorado, Maine or Wisconsin. On the other hand, a narrow Trump loss could lead to finger-pointing if Cruz doesn't bring on board his supporters. “I think he wants to part of the team. I think he’s very bright, I think he’s capable of really adding something to it. But he also is concerned with being principled in this particular case,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). “You walk a fine line sometimes. I’m hopeful we’ll have a united effort.”",1,0,0
1044,"Hillary Clinton got a major boost in August from some of her richest and most loyal supporters, with 11 seven-figure checks to fuel a spending surge from the main super PAC supporting her candidacy. Priorities USA Action raised $23.4 million in August, more than half of which came from its top five donors, according to its monthly report filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. It was the super PAC's best fundraising month by far, more than doubling July's take. Story Continued Below Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner each gave $3 million. Billionaire financier George Soros kicked in $2.5 million, and investor Donald Sussman and Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective both added $2 million. Sussman's latest gift brings his tally for the cycle to $13 million, the most of any of Clinton's benefactors. Working for Working Americans, the Service Employees International Union Committee On Political Education, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association PAC, investor Henry Laufer and his wife, Marsha, all gave $1 million. The super PAC took advantage of the influx to step up its spending, dropping $20.6 million and ending the month with $41.5 million on hand, according to the report. It paid BuzzFeed $1 million for digital ads, $405,400 to Global Strategy Group for research and consultant travel, $247,600 to Ralston Lapp Media for video production and media consulting, and $234,400 to Shorr Johnson Magnus for the same. The report showed a $28,000 payment to CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that has also been serving the Democratic National Committee in the aftermath of its email hack.

894,"NBA legend and fearless columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar just debunked the central pillar of the Trump campaign of fear, racism and religious intolerance as un-American fearmongering with a historical parallel every by one America’s greatest Presidents which each and every Democratic voter needs to know: Most Americans are familiar with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s famous 1933 “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” inaugural address. But the full quote was an even starker warning: “Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” Fear, Roosevelt said, causes us to retreat from our duty rather than advance our causes. This year, we are in danger of retreating from building the America we’re all supposed to be proud of, one that protects all and offers equal opportunity to all. The fact that the fear that sends some of us scuttling away is “unreasoning” and “unjustified” makes us cowards. Cowards abandon principles at the first sign of danger and look for witches to burn — or foreigners to blame. If there’s one stunning thing about the 2016 general election, it’s the total abandonment of the American experiment by the Republican Party in exchange for the mindless rhetoric of terror and obedience. Normal American politicians ask people to put their faith in our country and its institutions, but Trump told the Republican Convention this year that he alone could solve America’s problems – which is the boldest, least believable, total gospel to his supporters. Trump’s fearmongering on national television starting last year, coincided with a rapid escalation in hate crimes against Muslims over their religious freedom according to Abdul-Jabbar. In fact, 2015 was the worst year to be Muslim in America since 2001, which university researchers in California speculatively attribute to the “Trump effect.” However, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar isn’t just one of the NBA’s legends, nor is he just a columnist whose clarity of insight and strength of voice continues to grow as he opines on the American experience. Kareem is a peer of Donald Trump who grew up in New York City at the same time, but with regular parents and without the trappings of lots of cash, a rich daddy and enough taxpayer subsidy cash to build a sports arena. That’s why he nailed something essential about the Republican nominee’s fragile psyche: Trump’s method for convincing people to go along with doing what they know is fundamentally anti-American — and just plain evil — involves scaring voters with a constant barrage of lies and exaggerations. The fact that this propaganda is so effective is especially sad, because the nation that once stood up to bullies like Hitler, Castro and Khrushchev is now falling into goose-step behind a home-grown bully who seems afraid of everything that isn’t part of his entitled life, who responds to his irrational fears the way a child does. Kareem called out Trump’s fearmongering for what it truly is, the reaction of a child who never truly became a man above the shoulders. The Republican never had to grow up, to sink or swim, to stumble and fall and keep working until you make it or not. When Donald Trump plunged his casinos into what would be their first of many bankruptcies, he was put on an allowance by the banks. Let that sink in – a 40-year-old person, purportedly a grown up, who needs to be kept on an allowance. Who paid that allowance? The many big banks Trump claims to despise today. Worse, they delivered Trump a reward for failure was after he’d wrecked the fortunes of not only his investors, but also the many small business people who never got paid for building his maniacal Taj Majal. Trump ultimately wrecked Atlantic City itself, whose casino industry never recovered from Trump’s foolishly ego driven business plans that all of his contemporaries derided as lunacy. Trump can only sell fear, because under the suit, under the fancy airplane, which he wouldn’t have today without daddy’s money and connections, under it all, he’s only got the emotional maturity of a spoiled child. A spoiled child who in the finest Republican tradition like George W. Bush before him has always failed upwards. Now, Trump wants  to bring back the last failed Republican regime’s worst ideas in spades, along with racism, openly visceral discrimination and a new kind of fear America has never seen. After 9/11 the Bush administration openly used fear to manipulate the public and government policy to help their cronies. Trump wants to use the same fear mongering, but without any actual problems happening. Shamefully, too many Americans are ready to buy into this new Republic of Fear, but as Kareem Abdul Jabbar concluded: “Compassion and courage are what makes America great, not hate and fear.”",0,1,0
453,"New York (CNN)There's one thing Donald Trump brings to the debate stage Monday night: unpredictability. The Republican nominee and his allies hope his unconventional style will be a huge asset when he squares off against Hillary Clinton -- a skilled debater in her own right. Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle But with 11 debates under his belt from the brutal Republican primary season, Trump has plenty of go-to moves when it comes to debating. Here's what we've learned from Trump's primary debate performances and what they could tell us to expect Monday night: Face-to-face insults Trump's affinity for insults and name-calling quickly became a staple of his presidential campaign. Jeb Bush may forever be remembered for the ""low energy"" moniker the billionaire coined. But Trump's name-calling on the stump before friendly crowds didn't stop when he joined his opponents on the same stage. Trump repeatedly called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a liar to his face in several of the debates, and even pulled out the ""Lyin' Ted"" moniker. Poll: Clinton, Trump virtually tied headed into debate And when Marco Rubio repeatedly needled Trump, the brash billionaire didn't think twice before throwing ""Little Marco"" and ""lightweight"" in the Florida senator's face. ""This guy's a choke artist and this guy's a liar,"" Trump once said of Cruz and Rubio during a debate. The name-calling and insults served the dual purpose of drawing attention to the core vulnerabilities of Trump's opponents, while also deflecting from whatever attack they were throwing his way. If Trump sticks to this pattern, Clinton should gird herself for the ""Crooked Hillary"" moniker and a volley of adjectives from ""corrupt"" to ""criminal."" There's nowhere he won't go Trump has done more than just name-calling in the debates. A big reason his attacks have been so effective has been his willingness to strike where traditional politicians would hold back or take a less direct tack. After all, Trump is the candidate who suggested Ben Carson was incurably mentally ill due to childhood anger issues and floated the conspiracy theory that Cruz's father was involved in JFK's assassination. Perhaps most memorably, during the March 3 debate, Trump defended himself from Rubio's attacks on the size of his hands -- and the implications about his manhood. ""He referred to my hands, if they are small something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem, I guarantee,"" Trump said. Team Trump: We didn't invite Gennifer Flowers And physical appearance wasn't beyond the pale for Trump, who once threw this zinger at Rand Paul: ""I never attacked him or his looks and believe me there's plenty of subject matter right there."" Trump has already thrown every scandal and conspiracy theory Clinton's way. He's raised her husband's sex scandals and called her a ""nasty, mean enabler."" He's also revived the debunked theory that she was involved in the death of White House staffer Vince Foster and has suggested she's mentally and physically unfit to serve as president. Trump has already hinted that there's a chance he'll cross that line, but only if Clinton does first. Belittles canned responses The canned zinger is a staple of presidential debates that, if done right, can leave a mark. But Trump loves to slap down anything he considers to be a pre-packaged, poll-tested line. During the late February GOP debate, Rubio hit Trump with an seemingly prepared line: ""If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it."" Why the debate expectations game is a farce ""So cute. Such a cute soundbite,"" Trump fired back, undercutting the zing of Rubio' line. Clinton can expect a similar retort if she deploys the same tactic. It's part of a larger theme of Trump's candidacy -- one that bemoans and belittles ""all talk, no action"" career politicians and makes a mockery of tired political tropes. That's not to say he won't bring any prepared materials Trump hasn't brought any focus grouped zingers to his debate performances, but he has frequently recycled lines he's prone to use during rallies and in interviews. Whether it's about the ""third world"" nature of US infrastructure or lamenting the US trade imbalance with Mexico while saying their leaders are ""much smarter"" than those in America, Trump's debate performances are laced with Trump's favorite throwaway lines. But while his campaign has consistently sought to lower expectations and downplay the amount of effort the billionaire puts into debate prep, Trump has also arrived prepared. 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders After Cruz attacked Trump on his ""New York values,"" Trump arrived at the following debate with a well thought out and even uncharacteristically poignant rebuttal. ""When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,"" Trump said. Rapid fire Trump has prided himself on being a counter-puncher. He waits for his rivals to go after him and then he hits them back twice as hard. Throw that into a debate context and Trump's counter punching gives him a chance to show voters he's quick on his feet to dismiss rivals' attacks or deflect with one of his own. But Trump's knack for returning fire is also a tactic to try and knock his rivals off kilter and make them look weak. Debate commission chief: Candidates should fact-check each other Rather than wait for his rivals to finish their attack, Trump might interject with a snide comment belittling the line or deploy one of his many facial expressions that will catch the attention of the television audience. The goal for Trump is to get under his rivals' skin, poking at them to draw them into a back-and-forth -- one Trump likely won't back down from. When it comes to Clinton, Trump's rapid-fire put downs are likely to sound a lot like the schoolyard put down, ""I know you are but what am I."" Pressed on his biggest weaknesses by Clinton, Trump has frequently replied in boomerang fashion, flinging Clinton's words right back at her. Go after the moderator If all else fails, Trump will turn to his favorite tactic of attacking the media -- in this case, the debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC. Faced with tough questions during the primary from conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly -- in two separate debates -- Trump deflected with a personal attack or threat. ""First of all, very few people listen to your radio show, that's the good news,"" Trump responded when Hewitt asked Trump about releasing his tax returns. How Lester Holt is getting ready for Monday's debate And when Kelly asked Trump during the first primary debate last August about the disparaging comments he's made about women, Trump famously retorted with a warning. ""I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn't do that,"" Trump said. Already, Trump has sought to work the refs, suggesting Holt would be unfair to him and arguing that moderators shouldn't play the role of fact-checkers. ",1,0,0

Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples. “Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing. “1. Does he actually know - or care to know - the basic information needed to competently run the country? … 2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government? … 3.

Just six weeks after he dropped out – and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention – the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texan’s own political future. ...

PRESIDENT TRUMP -- “Trump hitches a ride on Bibi’s coattails,” by Michael Crowley: “Donald Trump once promised to be the ‘neutral guy’ in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and said he didn’t want to assign fault in the never-ending impasse. Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel’s eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian ‘hatred and violence’ for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts. “Not to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, ‘any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.’ … The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters. They also prompted complaints from Trump critics that Netanyahu was legitimizing Trump on the world stage.” http://politi.co/2dvqQz7 NYT EDITORIAL BOARD, part II -- “Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President: Donald Trump is a man who dwells in bigotry, bluster and false promises”: “When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president 15 months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican ‘rapists’ flooding across the Southern border. From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump’s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.” http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd AIR WARS -- “Coal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign,” by Josh Gerstein: “For the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday’s oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C.

In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ... “[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative.

And, she’s also been responsible for the group raising more money to achieve that goal — $26.8 million as of July — than ever before. “This really is EMILY’s List’s moment,” Schriock said. “We are having our most successful fundraising cycle and we are going to have by far the largest women voter program, which is our independent expenditure arm, that we’ve ever had.” The bar at the debate is higher for Hillary Clinton: “This is a really important moment and the first time that Americans have seen a woman standing on that stage for a presidential debate and I think she’s going to be ready. I know there is no one who prepares harder than Hillary Clinton, but the stakes are high and the bar is really high for her. I don’t think there is anything they can do about that. Like so many of our women candidates they just have to deal with it.” Stunned at Trump’s comments on women: “I think it is really really important for all of the women in this country… to know that Donald Trump has these views and has no problem just letting these really offensive words come off his tongue.” Trump’s policy targeting women is a sham: “It was atrocious policy. It was the kind of thing that a campaign throws together with less than 60 days left when they know they are losing particularly women voters. Women voters and Americans in general are obviously not going to fall for something like that.” Female candidates will determine Senate majority: “Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, and now Deborah Ross, who we are so proud of in North Carolina, those four races are the keys to the majority and they have incredibly strong candidates we’ve been working on since day one, or even before as we tried to recruit them and got them in these races.” 2016, ya'll. pic.twitter.com/M0AZceVagQ — Victor Ng (@victomato) September 25, 2016 SPOTTED: Charles Dance, of Game of Thrones fame, upon accepting the 2016 William Shakespeare Award for Classical Theatre, finished his acceptance speech with a commentary on American politics. “I would like to wish you all a Trump-free future.” … North Carolina Rep.

92,"On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. So how exactly does a veto override work? The rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber ""shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it."" In other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first. Both the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the ""yeas and nays"" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator’s name is called by the clerk. Though the Senate received President Obama’s veto message on Friday, they’re not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor. Then, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?"" While some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass. Assuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue. If the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.",1,0,0
1585,"The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments. NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong. In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today reported. Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war. After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations. “You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said. “Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice. You can see it here:  Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did. It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name. Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

96,"A Dallas police officer, seeing red after several shootings of police officers, has decided heâs had enough and he and his lawyer, are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war. Yes, this is the same ârace warâ that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system. Police Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, a 17-year veteran of the Dallas police force, is suing leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement â along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, billionaire George Soros, Louis Farrakhan, former Attorney General Eric Holder, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and many more. The bizarre part is that he and his attorney, right-wing nut Larry Klayman, actually see an active conspiracy here: âThis is a civil action for the deprivation of Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights, conspiracy against the Plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights.â The complaint also says this: âKlayman received a call from Defendant New Black Panther Party and Black Lives Matter acting in concert with the other Defendants, all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented, threatening to kill him and his family.â [emphasis mine] In discussing the July 7 murders of Dallas police officers, the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone, and was not affiliated with Black Lives Matter or anything else. An investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. Apparently, thatâs enough to tie him and these groups directly to Hillary, Obama, Holder, and everyone else, although itâs hard to see how Klayman and Pennie actually know thereâs a conspiracy here. Itâs like they just â the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines: âDefendants, acting in concert, and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement personsâ¦â âActing in concertâ means thereâs a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something. Thereâs no real, concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers. Yet, they keep using that phrase. We do not think it means what they think it means. Either that, or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this. Or both. Itâs probably both. The complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers âare intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport.â Exaggerate much, Klayman? Lords, gods and minor deities, itâs amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court. Other known problems, such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes, and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population, are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose, too. Klayman, however, has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time. Back in July, he threatened to sue Obama, Farrakhan, Sharpton and Black Lives Matter for putting his life in danger âas a white person.â At the time, he said things like this: âIt is no wonder some cops, fearing for their lives in this anti-white, anti-Semitic and anti-Christian environment, sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly.â Heâs not exactly the most credible person here. He has an axe to grind, and it doesnât make Pennie look good for retaining him for this suit (or did Klayman persuade Pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick? We may never know). The discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting. The entire 66-page complaint is below: [scribd id=324251965 key=key-2XEsBrU2vkK8S40trOMu mode=scroll] ",0,1,0
1131,"Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead over Donald Trump among likely voters in North Carolina, a New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll released Thursday morning shows. With just 47 days to go until November’s general election, the former secretary of state leads the Manhattan billionaire in a head-to-head matchup by two points, 45 percent to 43 percent. That advantage for Clinton sits within the poll’s 3.6 percentage point margin of error. Story Continued Below But in a three-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson, Clinton and Trump are tied at 41 percent. The former New Mexico governor polled at 11 percent. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate for president, is not on the ballot in North Carolina. Support for the two major party candidates breaks down largely along racial lines, with Trump leading Clinton among white likely voters, 56 percent to 30 percent. The former secretary of state holds a formidable advantage with the state’s African-American population, leading 91 percent to 4 percent. The Times’ poll was released one day after a Fox News poll of North Carolina showed Trump with a five-point lead over Clinton, an advantage that sits outside that poll’s margin of error. The Fox News poll also showed incumbent GOP Sen. Richard Burr with a 6 point lead over Democrat Deborah Ross and a 3 point lead for Republican Gov.

1067,"Even though Donald Trump finally acknowledged last week that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, one of the Republican nominee's most prominent allies in law enforcement is not dropping the case. “I don’t care where he’s from,” Joe Arpaio, sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, told the Surprise Tea Party Patriots group on Tuesday, according to The Arizona Republic. “We are looking at a forged document. Period.” Story Continued Below Arpaio also appeared to dismiss the notion that Trump's disavowal of his past birtherism played any role in his determination to keep investigating Obama's birth certificate, an inquiry that began in August 2011, four months after the White House released the document. “I know all the politicians say, ‘Sheriff, don’t talk about it,’” Arpaio said, according to the report. “But how can I back down when we started it? I’m not going to just forget it.” The Surprise Tea Party Patriots asked Arpaio to look into Obama's birthplace in August 2011. “I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate,” Arpaio said. “We did it on our own, because of you guys.” Arpaio also added, ""I’m not going to give up, and we’re looking into it ... I don’t know how it’s going to turn out.”",1,0,0
208,"In discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago, and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective, he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process. Of course, he thinks that the police wouldÂ take guns away from criminals, and that the Constitution is different for criminals, butÂ  has a constitutional right to due process. Doesnât matter to Trump, though: âWe have to take guns awayâ¦from bad people that shouldnât have them.â Those were Trumpâs words in the debate, where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise, and has also been deemed ineffective. How the NRA can support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us. Thatâs especially true given the fact that this isnât the first time Trump has said this: â[Police officers are] proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun, they will see the person and theyâll look and theyâll take the gun away. Theyâll stop, theyâll frisk and theyâll take the gun away, and they wonât have anything to shoot with.â The 2nd Amendment cannot exist without due process. The NRA is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens. ",0,1,0
1315,"As Congress careens toward a potential government shutdown, Democrats are dragging the funding fight to the brink and hoping to squeeze the GOP. The smart bet is still that Congress will pass some sort of stopgap bill to keep the government running past Friday. Neither party wants to risk being blamed for a shutdown just weeks before the presidential election. Story Continued Below But Democrats are driving a hard bargain: They say any government funding bill must include federal aid to address the water crisis in Flint. It’s a potentially risky move, but Democrats are betting they can either force Republicans to bend, or paint the GOP as indifferent to the people of Flint and responsible for Capitol Hill’s deepening dysfunction. ""This funding measure does not contain a single penny for Flint, Michigan,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor Monday. ""The people of Flint, Michigan have been waiting for emergency assistance to clean their poisoned water for more than a year."" The Senate is scheduled to hold a key procedural vote Tuesday on a proposal introduced by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But that measure, which would fund the federal government through Dec. 9, is expected to fall short of the 60 vote threshold needed to advance. The biggest complaint from Democrats is that the bill includes $500 million to address flooding in Louisiana and natural disasters in other states, but no money for Flint, which is still dealing with the consequences of lead-contaminated drinking water. Top Democrats think it's a political miscalculation for Republicans to be excluding assistance to a largely African-American community with high rates of poverty. Reid said it was ""callous"" of Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to refer to the calamity in Flint as “other people’s grief.” One potential resolution to the impasse is for McConnell to remove the money for Louisiana. ""Is their solution now to remove help for flood victims?"" McConnell asked on the floor Monday. ""If their solution is to remove help for flood victims, they should say so."" But Democrats might accept that, reasoning that they could return in the lame duck and press for aid for both communities. In recent weeks, Democrats have insisted that any aid for floods be coupled with aid for Flint. McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been eager to show voters that Republicans can govern responsibly and have downplayed the latest skirmish. Ryan told CBS’ John Dickerson in an interview that aired Sunday that there would be no government shutdown. “I’m not worried about that,” he said. “This is the typical drama.” And top Democratic strategists argue that the public has blamed Republicans for past shutdown showdowns — giving them an advantage in this latest fight. “We see our leverage in getting Flint aid as being the fact that Republicans lose every shutdown fight,” said a senior Democratic Senate aide. “We know it. They know it.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest has said the president may not sign McConnell’s bill and urged Congress to act “without putting the American people and the American economy through another cliffhanger related to a government shutdown.” The White House Office of Management and Budget has begun the earliest stages of preparing for a shutdown, holding a planning call with agencies last Friday ahead of the end of the fiscal year. “The administration strongly believes that a lapse in appropriations should not occur,” said an OMB spokesperson. “However, at this time, prudent management requires that the government plan for the possibility of a lapse and OMB is working with agencies to take appropriate action.” A senior GOP Senate aide said Senate Democrats were intentionally trying to foment chaos. “They want to talk about shutdowns. They want to create chaos right before the election,” the aide said, adding that it was no coincidence the clash comes as Republican chances of holding on to the Senate majority have improved. Republicans note there is much in the legislation for Democrats to like. It includes $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus without language that would exclude Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics from accessing federal grant dollars — a key Democratic demand that had long snarled Congress’ effort to counter the mosquito-borne virus. The bill also funds veterans programs and provides some money to implement a popular law signed in July to curb prescription opioid addiction. And despite a strong push from conservatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and the backing of GOP nominee Donald Trump, the bill does not include language to block the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. It’s a “clean” bill, McConnell boasted, with no controversial policy riders. Democrats don’t fully agree. They are irritated that the legislation prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose political spending. That provision simply maintains current law, making it harder for Democrats to demand its removal since they permitted it in last year’s omnibus, but it offers them a chance to slam the GOP as beholden to corporate interests. Ahead of Tuesday’s procedural vote to end Senate debate on the package, aides were predicting the parties would remain largely united. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, has said he would support the so-called continuing resolution since it provides money to take on Zika, which has spread quickly in the Sunshine State. Other Democrats from states that would receive disaster aid in the bill, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, might also buck party leaders. But McConnell can’t count on keeping all Republicans on his side; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he will oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank. Cruz and other conservatives might also defect. Ryan and other Republicans argue that any debate on Flint aid should take place on water infrastructure legislation moving through Congress. The Senate passed that bill, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month. But the House version of the Water Resources Development Act, which is set for floor action this week, does not include any money for Flint. Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) has promised that any final negotiations on the bill, which would conclude in a December session, will end with Flint aid. But Democrats are skeptical after months of GOP resistance. “I’m not going to accept, on faith, that if we leave Flint behind in the CR, somehow there will be an epiphany between now and December, and what they oppose today, they will suddenly embrace then,” said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). “Nobody would buy that. It doesn’t make sense.” Kildee noted that Democrats will be crucial to helping House GOP leadership carry any stop-gap spending bill approved by the Senate across the finish line; many conservative Republicans wanted a long-term CR to avoid a lame duck budget battle and are likely to oppose whatever the Senate passes. The conservative group Heritage Action is opposed to the CR and is warning lawmakers it will include a vote on the bill on its influential scorecard. “Harry Reid is playing dangerous and irresponsible games with military pay, national security and critical services as he aims to shut down the federal government,” said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. Flores added that McConnell was “caving in to this irresponsible behavior by surrendering important conservative policies.” Seung Min Kim and Anthony Adragna contributed to this report.",1,0,0
939,"The first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates. Instead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media. There is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was “no bigger jagoff in the world.” The indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets — that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years. Clinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton’s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, “That makes me smart.” Trump’s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate. An hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , “It sounds like you admitted you haven’t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?” Trump replied, “No, I didn’t say that at all.” Trump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said: I get audited every year my taxes are — it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of — do what the law recommends. But I’m not against paying taxes. And I’ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take. .@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV — Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016 The contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No. Trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system.

The meeting was requested by Ivanka Trump, according to the speaker's office. ""It was a productive conversation where Ryan spoke about his 2012 experience and Ivanka shared updates about her father's campaign,"" the aide said. Ryan was in town to address a luncheon at the Economic Club of New York. The meeting was first reported by Politico. Ryan and Donald Trump have had a tense relationship throughout the 2016 campaign. Ryan: Trump should release his taxes After Trump became the presumptive nominee, Ryan publicly hesitated to endorse him, saying he needed time to decide. He eventually did endorse Trump, and the two have met. But Ryan has also remained critical of some of Trump's policies and rhetoric. Trump has returned the favor to Ryan, echoing his wait-and-see language on endorsing the speaker during his primary race. Ivanka Trump is one of Trump's closest confidantes. She has also been involved in policy development, recently pushing her father to unveil a childcare proposal.

Medina Independent School District placed a sign in front of one of its entrances Sept. 14 to warn people that teachers might be armed, reports CNN. “Please be aware that the staff at Medina ISD may be armed and will use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,” the sign says. The warning serves as a good way to drive away potential threats, according to the school’s superintendent. “I think that anybody who might have a thought about harming someone in mind might think twice about it,” Superintendent Penny White said, according to KSAT 12. “We’re 20 minutes or 25 minutes from Bandera. That’s our closest law enforcement.” White and Dr. James Lindstrom, a school board member, said no specific event spurred the sign, Lindstrom added it was posted due to the “the general environment nationally.” Jillian Sides, a mother with two sons at the school, thought the sign was a good way to keep away threats. “Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and I’m perfectly fine with it,” she told KSAT. Another mother disagreed, believing the sign could bring trouble. “I don’t know if that’s asking for trouble or not. I mean, you post a sign like that, it may bring trouble, unfortunately,” said Alisha Reagan, a mother of a third-grader. White would not name the teachers, if any, who are armed.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle. The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter. The Obama center  requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating.

792,"President Obama just made his last address as a sitting President to the United Nations General Assembly. In his speech he stressed about the necessity of international law and order. He told the assembly of 140 different countries that the United States would have to give up some of our freedoms. Yup, you read that right. He passive aggressively made attacks against those who oppose a lenient form of refugee resettlement. As well, he noted that one of the worlds greatest problems being dealt with is when, “powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law. We can press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat… along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.” Several times he references global integration as well as noting that liberal societies show discrimination and intolerance when women choose to cover themselves. An obvious reference to the Burkini ban in France. Obama said, “And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries.” The absolute worse part was then he said that America would likely have to accept more constraints, and deprive themselves of freedoms by binding ourselves to international rules. Specifically, he said, “We have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” Watch his speech here,  This progressive politicians tune has not changed one bit. When in fact all the things he is criticizing about anti refugee sentiment are things that Americans and other Europeans actually believe and feel. Yet, he dismisses it. He and his administration are the only ones who feel this way. This way being a liberal narrative. The narrative being that Islam is a peaceful religion, jihadism does not represent Islam, more refugees should be allowed into the United States with less vetting, and that incoming refugees don’t deteriorate a countries culture. These are all true yet he dismisses it like it is completely false. Just because he and his administration don’t admit the truth to themselves does not mean the rest of us have to remain in the dark.

A new poll from McClatchy-Marist shows Clinton leading Trump by 24 points among registered female voters (58 percent to 34 percent), and 23 points among likely female voters. Remember, Mitt Romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and John McCain by 13 points. While the Trump campaign and his supporters scratch their heads as to why he’s performing so poorly with the demographic that makes up the majority of the country, the Clinton campaign is reminding them why. A new (and brutal) ad has just been released from the Clinton camp. Asking voters if Trump is “the president we want for our daughters?” the ad, titled Mirrors, uses the Donald’s deplorable, sexist, offensive and objectifying words against women From, “I’d look her right in that ugly face of hers,” to “A person who’s flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,” showcases women all across the country looking at themselves — their bodies, appearance — at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, as Trump’s disgusting words echo off the screen. When talking about Kim Kardashian, Trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset: “Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely.” So presidential. The most damning part comes at the end, when Howard Stern asks Trump, “So you treat women with respect?” Trump’s answer? “No, I can’t say that either.” This ad is so powerful. Trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods. No wonder his first wife cited ‘cruel and inhumane’ treatment as the grounds for their divorce, and called him a “chauvinist” on TV. Little girls, and indeed little boys, are watching.

It all happened at a Black Lives Matter vigil being held in Stockton, CA where a black man was fatally wounded by police for ignoring officer’s commands to drop his handgun. The teenage girls were not participating in the protest, but just passing by. They both believed they were attacked because they were white.   Police say two Caucasian girls left a local restaurant and passed by the protest when they were attacked by the protestors. What was supposed to be a peaceful protest remembering Colby Friday turned into a vicious brawl directed against two sisters, and now, investigators are looking for suspects. “Our understanding is that it involved several out-of-towners whose intent was more than protesting,” said Ron Freitas, the Assistant District Attorney for San Joaquin County. Stockton police say the protestors claimed to be connected with the Black Lives Matter movement and were protesting recent officer-involved shootings against blacks. WARNING to white people: Don’t let your curiosity put you in danger. Black Lives Matter protests are filled with thugs who think white people are the devil and are the reason for all their problems.

60,"Wells Fargo's embattled CEO is resigning his position on the Federal Reserve's advisory council amid a scandal over millions of accounts allegedly opened by the bank without customers' permission. The San Francisco Fed said Thursday that John Stumpf is giving up his position as representative from the central bank's San Francisco region on the advisory council. The move was a ""personal decision"" by Stumpf, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said. ""His top priority is leading Wells Fargo."" His resignation from the council, which meets four times a year with the Fed's board of governors to discuss economic and banking issues, was effective immediately. Members serve one-year terms starting in January. The announcement came two days after Stumpf faced bipartisan outrage from a Senate panel over the alleged misconduct, believed to have gone on at the second-largest U.S. bank for years. Some 5,300 employees were fired. Wells Fargo & Co., which is based in San Francisco, was fined $185 million by U.S. and California regulators earlier this month. In a feverish drive to meet sales targets, bank employees opened the unauthorized accounts, transferred customers' money into them, and signed people up for online banking, according to the regulators. Debit cards were issued and activated, as well as PINs created, without customers' knowledge. Stumpf told the Senate Banking Committee in his testimony Tuesday he was ""deeply sorry"" the bank failed to meet its responsibility to customers and didn't act sooner to stem the misconduct. He promised to assist affected customers. The bank says it has already refunded to customers $2.6 million in fees charged for products that were sold without authorization. Senators of both parties accused the bank of fraud and told Stumpf he was scapegoating legions of lower-level employees while senior executives kept their jobs and received hefty pay packages. Stumpf, a 34-year veteran of Wells Fargo and CEO since 2007, earned $19.3 million last year. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of the retail banking business, announced in July that she would retire from the bank this year. She is expected to leave with as much as $125 million in salary, stock options and other compensation. The bank says it will end its sales quota system at year's end. While it varied by branch size and day of the week, a typical employee had to sell between 13 and 15 banking products a day — a new account, a mortgage, a retirement account, or even online banking.

1048,"NEW YORK — The Clinton Global Initiative has alerted dozens of employees that their jobs will be eliminated at year’s end, even as it plans to retain some staff to continue working with donors, according to two former Clinton Foundation officials who remain in communication with staff. The winding down of CGI after this week’s glitzy gathering and the resulting layoffs stem from concessions made by the Clinton Foundation to controversies swirling around Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Story Continued Below But the recent moves to sunset the project have prompted controversies of their own around the Clinton Foundation, which administers CGI. And they presage the difficulties the Clintons can be expected to face if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency and they move forward with plans to scale back the rest of the foundation. Some foundation allies grumbled that the announcement of CGI’s elimination — and of many of its positions — was handled in an insensitive manner, according to the former officials. Others predicted that retaining some staff to work with deep-pocketed government, corporate and nonprofit donors on existing programs would only feed criticism about whether some of the businessmen, companies or foreign governments that donated to the global charity got preferential treatment from Hillary Clinton’s State Department. It’s a “bad idea” to retain CGI staff, said one of the former officials, adding, “I really think they should make a clean break, and apparently so do most staff.” CGI at its peak employed around 200 full-time staffers. Many of those have sought — or accepted — new jobs in recent months as the fate of the initiative became uncertain. It’s not clear how many remain employed, precisely how many jobs are being eliminated at the end of the year or how many would be retained in 2017. A Clinton Foundation spokesman would not answer those questions, but he defended the foundation’s handling of CGI’s wind-down. “All full-time CGI employees will have their jobs with benefits at least through the end of the calendar year,” said the spokesman. The foundation is providing departing staff with “a wide range of resources that include career coaching, access to job leads in a variety of fields, and resume and job search strategy,” the spokesman said, explaining, “we informed CGI staff of this transition more than four months before the end of the year, and have provided information about CGI-related roles that will continue.” Remaining staff will be working with government, corporate and individual partners that have pledged assistance for ongoing humanitarian projects around the world, the spokesman said. “Staff will be performing a number of roles, including continuing to provide advice with respect to commitment development and commitment improvement, based on our commitment database and experience having previously developed over 3,600 commitments with our members, and continuing to facilitate introductions and partnerships between members,” the spokesman said. He added that not all of those partners give directly to the Clinton Foundation. The spokesman pointed to an open letter written by former President Bill Clinton in which he announced the sun-setting of CGI, while also crediting its partnership model for changing the face of modern philanthropy and corporate social responsibility. “It’s been one of the great honors of my life to be part of this special community, and I hope the hard work and benefits of CGI’s great staff and its members’ creative cooperation will keep rippling out into the world,” Clinton wrote. In his opening remarks on Monday, Bill Clinton said, “I think the way to end this is not on a nostalgia trip, but doing what we set up to do. Which is just keep working to push the ball forward.” Since Clinton launched CGI in 2005, its members have made more than 3,600 commitments in areas including housing, education, workforce training sustainable energy and food systems, according to the foundation’s website. It says the commitments “have improved the lives of over 435 million people in more than 180 countries.” This is the 12th and last CGI conference, regardless of whether Hillary Clinton or her Republican opponent Donald Trump win the presidency. The foundation hasn’t provided details on how CGI’s programs might continue, though many of the commitments made by CGI partners are to multi-year projects, and it is unlikely that all would wrap up at the end of this year. The foundation has provided more detail on other changes that the Clinton Foundation will enact if Hillary Clinton is elected. It will no longer accept new contributions from foreign or corporate donors and will formally change its name from the “Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation” to the “Clinton Foundation,” while Bill Clinton will step down from its board. CGI originally was intended as a 10-year program of the foundation. But it continued for longer, partly because it attracted so much interest — and money — from the corporate and NGO worlds and partly because it became Bill Clinton’s favorite showcase, according to sources who worked with the foundation. Its annual meeting is a see-and-be-seen event featuring a mix of swanky parties and high-minded discussions about finding solutions to global problems ranging from climate change to childhood obesity. This week’s final gathering includes panels and parties featuring heads of state, Fortune 100 CEOs, Hollywood actor Ben Affleck and world-class athletes. But it also has prompted teeth-gnashing among foundation staff and allies who are concerned that it’s an easy target for Trump supporters. Those concerns were exacerbated Monday when Bill Clinton conceded that some donors may have given money to the foundation to build a relationship with the Clintons or to gain access to the State Department during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller responded Tuesday, asking, “Doesn’t this validate claims of pay-for-play within the organization?” Sponsors also seemed less eager to affiliate with CGI this year than in the past. The final meeting lists 23 sponsors, down from 33 last year and 46 at the annual meeting’s height, in 2011. Notable dropouts this year include Coca-Cola, which sponsored the event the last three years, and Barclays, a sponsor since 2010. Longtime sponsor Goldman Sachs also declined to participate this year. Some staffers grumbled after being told that they couldn’t leave after the meeting and receive severance through the end of the year, so that they could hunt for jobs full-time, said the former foundation official. Instead, the former official said they are “being asked to stay until the end of December to update data into a database.” Few staffers were informed about the move before it was announced in an August staff meeting by foundation CEO Donna Shalala and Bill Clinton, said the former official. Since then, they’ve learned their fate on a piecemeal basis, according to two people with knowledge of the process. “It was poorly managed, treated too glibly, patronizingly, completely lacking empathy at the fact that so many young people were going to be laid off,” said the former official.",1,0,0

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.” The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion. The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. “I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House. Watch ABC News’ report here: ",0,1,0
825,"The students in teacher Lee Francis’ history class will probably never forget the lesson he taught on free speech… just not in the way he probably expected. Days ago, a photo appearing to show a teacher (later identified as the aforementioned Lee Francis) Francis, a teacher at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was giving a lesson Monday on the First Amendment. His method? First, he tried to burn the American flag. Then he tried to cut it. Then he placed it on the floor and stepped on it. Many, predictably, were outraged. However, Francis said he wasn’t trying to offend students, just teach them the Supreme Court ruled such acts of free expression were protected. That sounds like a good excuse, but some of his actions make me question whether or not he’s telling the truth. According to Fox News, in a phone interview he stated “Do I regret what I did? Absolutely not. Would I do it again? All I can say is I did it and I stand by it.” He also said that he has obtained legal counsel. “There were some laws broken as far as photos of me taken that violate the county’s policies – and issues that could be considered defamation of character,” he said. Riiiiiight. So he’s all for teaching freedom of speech, but taking a photo is where he draws the line? I don’t know if I’m buying it. Regardless, as WorldStarHipHop reported, he’s now been suspended and there’s an investigation pending. Here’s how this whole ordeal has turned out thus far:  What do you all think? If he really was teaching a lesson on the First Amendment, do you think this is an extreme way of teaching it? While I do find it distasteful, it is a reminder of the freedoms we’re afforded in America. Most people around the world don’t have the same freedom. ",0,0,1
1121,"Donald Trump on Thursday offered some advice to Lester Holt, who will moderate Monday’s presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton: Don’t be Candy Crowley. The Republican presidential nominee suggested that the “NBC Nightly News” anchor be a moderator, not a fact-checker, a recommendation that comes after NBC’s Matt Lauer faced intense criticism earlier this month after allowing Trump’s assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq War go unchecked. Story Continued Below “Well, I think he has to be a moderator,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” of Holt during a phone interview Thursday morning. “I mean, you’re debating somebody and if she makes a mistake or I make a mistake, I’ll, you know, we’ll take each other on. But I certainly don’t think you want Candy Crowley again.” Crowley, who moderated a 2012 debate at Hofstra University, where Trump and Clinton will square off Monday, attempted to fact check then-GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an “act of terror.” “And she turned out to be wrong. I really don’t think you want that,” Trump said. “That was a very pivotal moment in that debate. And it really threw the debate off and it was unfair. So I don’t think you want that. No, I think you have to have somebody that’s just — let them argue it out.” PolitiFact later rated Romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that Obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed.""",1,0,0
127,"Guess who George H.W. Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that heâs actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton. According to Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that heâs a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicansâ chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasnât Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsendâdaughter of the late Robert Kennedyâwho let this particular interesting tidbit slip: âOn Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: âThe President told me heâs voting for Hillary!!'â She stood by that later on when talking to According to her, George H.W. Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successorâs wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump. A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this â he said that George H.W.âs vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isnât commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle arenât being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed. Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. Thatâs a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism. His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that heâs also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say weâve built in even the smallest way. Earlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who canât find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump. A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed. ",0,1,0
24,"Evan Bayh was the Democrats' prize Senate recruit this election cycle, a popular former senator and governor with a huge war chest and sky-high name ID in his home state. Top Democrats heralded his surprise entrance into the race in July with hopes that Republicans would abandon his little-known and underfunded GOP rival, Rep. Todd Young, and give up on Indiana. Instead, outside GOP groups including the Chamber of Commerce and the billionaire Koch Brothers have poured some $10 million into the race, eroding Bayh's fund-raising advantage and closing his lead over Young to low- or mid-single digits. With Republicans determined to retain their narrow majority in the Senate, they have brought big-name surrogates like former President George W. Bush and House Speaker Paul Ryan into the state. They have succeeded in putting Bayh on the defensive, in the process turning the race into one of the hardest fought contests in this year's heated struggle for control of the U.S. Senate and the balance of power in Washington, D.C. ""I'm not a lobbyist,"" Bayh was forced to insist in an ad responding to a barrage of attacks on his work in Washington, D.C., since leaving the Senate six years ago. And with Bayh dropping fast in the polls, outside Democratic groups are belatedly coming to his aid, with the Senate Majority PAC and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee both announcing spending on his behalf in recent days, a move some Democrats once hoped would not be necessary. ""Clearly our message is resonating with Hoosiers — and over a very short time period,"" Young said at a recent news conference before former President Bush headlined an Indianapolis fundraiser on his behalf. ""This race for United State Senate here in Indiana could dictate control of the U.S. Senate and even composition of the Supreme Court moving forward,"" Young added. ""It is essential that Republicans hold on to this seat in what is otherwise a Republican state."" Democrats concede that their initial strategy of scaring off the GOP with a shock-and-awe entry from Bayh didn't pan out. But they insist they still have a path to victory, even if some privately question whether the 60-year-old Bayh is up for a tougher fight than he envisioned when Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York urged him into the race. Bayh himself, appearing over the weekend at a Jefferson Jackson Day Dinner Banquet in Muncie, dismissed the attacks coming his way. ""These are the acts of desperate people who don't stand for a doggone thing,"" Bayh said. ""They know the only way they can try and win this election is not on the basis of their ideas or what they're going to do for you or the good people of Delaware County because they've got no ideas for the people of Delaware County."" The race in Indiana is practically the only competitive Senate contest being fought this year in a red state, where Donald Trump is all but certain to triumph easily over Democrat Hillary Clinton, who herself played a role in encouraging Bayh to run. Both sides agree that Indiana's GOP tilt helps Young, although Democrats contend that Bayh's strong reputation and high name ID counteract it. Young remains little known, but Republicans have succeeded in driving down Bayh's numbers with ads tying him to Clinton and criticizing his support for President Barack Obama's health care law, which is unpopular in the state. Incumbent GOP Sen. Dan Coats is retiring. Democrats insist they can still win in Indiana, but the changing landscape here comes amid a shifting Senate map nationally that's looking more favorable for the GOP. Republicans now have a 54-46 advantage in the Senate, meaning Democrats need to pick up five seats to win control, or four if Clinton wins the White House since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes. Democrats appear to be losing confidence in battleground Ohio and Florida but pushing into North Carolina and Missouri, while New Hampshire and Pennsylvania remain closely fought. Republicans have all but abandoned GOP incumbents in Illinois and Wisconsin, but are focused on picking up a seat in Nevada, where Minority Leader Harry Reid is retiring. In the latest development in Indiana, the National Rifle Association announced it is coming into the state with a $500,000 buy to attack Bayh's ""anti-gun record."" Despite the influx of outside spending, Indiana University public affairs professor Paul Helmke says the race is still Bayh's to lose. ""Evan Bayh came with a major lead in money, which meant there was going to be a lot of outside money coming in,"" said Helmke, a former Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, who ran for U.S. Senate in 1998 but lost to Bayh. ""If they were thinking this was a laydown, then that was a mistake on their part. Bayh's going to have to work this one really hard to win."" ——— Werner reported from Washington.",1,0,0

""That is mainstream media nonsense put out by her."" Story Continued Below Moderator Lester Holt of NBC noted that ""the record shows otherwise."" Indeed, in September of 2002, before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Trump said, ""Yeah, I guess so,"" when asked by radio host Howard Stern whether he supported that move. ""When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anybody's asked me, I said, 'I don't know,' essentially,"" Trump said, going on to add that he would soon have arguments with Sean Hannity of Fox News, who did support the war, and that there was an article from 2004 in which he appeared strongly opposed to the war. The U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. ""If somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started,"" Trump said. ""He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that exactly what this has done."" ""My reference is to what you said in 2002,"" Holt pressed, going on to ask how his judgment differed from Clinton's. I have better judgment, I also have a much better temperament than she does, you know?"" he said, going on to add, ""I think my strongest asset, maybe by far is my temperament.

1438,"It does not matter anymore. The truth. Procedure. Commonsense. With all the hatred and immediate blame thrown on police officers for anything ranging from shootings to sneezes, it’s no wonder so many police departments are suffering with recruits. Who wants to be blamed for being a racist murderer when you are not one?  It just does not matter anymore. In this country, police are guilty until proven innocent in the eye of the public court of opinion. There have been police that have abused their power and those ones have been punished. But so many others along the way have been demonized by leftist media and terrorist activist groups like Black Lives Matter and the New Black Panthers. We can’t even agree as a people what is proper procedure for police. For instance, if you are told by police to stop moving, to stop moving your hands, to stop reaching your hands into places… is it then credible for an officer to use deadly force? BLM would say absolutely not. But why? Could a suspect be reaching for a gun? Yes. So many officers have been gunned down in exactly that type of scenario. Yet BLM and its followers demand that the officers talk their way out of situations like that. They demand that they use a taser. They demand that they shoot them in the leg. They demand a whole lot of stupid crap that they themselves would NEVER demand of themselves. What is justifiable self-defense to sane folks is straight out murder to others. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, another shooting by a white police officer has led to another black man’s death. The activists are out demanding justice…but when you ignore the orders of an officer, walk away from them back to your vehicle, then proceed to try and reach into your vehicle…what do you think the officers are thinking? Gun. That’s it. So, if you want to play dumb and ignore the warnings of cops, then your dumb ass deserves what’s coming.   A spokesman for the Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Department says officers found PCP in the SUV of an unarmed black man who was shot dead by a white female cop last week. Sgt. Dave Walker told the Tulsa World investigators they recovered a vial of the drug in Terence Crutcher’s vehicle after he was gunned down by officer Betty Shelby. Police say Crutcher, 40, did not have a gun on him or in his vehicle. Video footage of the shooting also showed him walking toward his SUV with his hands in the air. Shelby’s attorney said Tuesday morning that his client had suspected Crutcher was high and opened fire after he reached through the window, perceiving it as a threat. ",0,0,1
48,"The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted 19-15 today to hold Hillary Clinton's former IT staffer in contempt of Congress. For the second time in two weeks, Bryan Pagliano, former senior adviser for information resource management at the State Department, failed to show up to a hearing to testify on the preservation of State Department records. Pagliano was the IT staffer who set up Clinton's private email server during her time as secretary of state. On Sept. 13, Pagliano did not show up to testify before the committee despite being subpoenaed. After his chair was vacant again at today's hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah and chairman of the committee, held a vote to hold Pagliano in contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by the committee.     The vote passed 19 to 15, split along party lines. The resolution will now travel to the House floor. Chaffetz argued that Pagliano is a key witness in the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct government business. The chairman asserted that Pagliano had no reason not to appear before the committee because he would not be subject to criminal liability due to immunity granted by the Department of Justice. But Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, vigorously defended Pagliano’s decision not to show up, saying that the committee had harassed him by sending U.S. marshals to his workplace with the subpoena. “I simply cannot vote for a resolution that is potentially so unethical,” Cummings said. Cummings has continuously charged that the hearings related to Clinton's email server are political in nature.  Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts, feared that the committee was trying to embarrass Pagliano. ""The chairman is saying that his rule is that the witness has to come before the Committee and be subjected to what the witnesses were subjected to last week,"" Lynch said, later adding, ""We’re continuing to try to embarrass this particular witness.” Pagliano’s lawyer, Mark MacDougall, has said that if his client were brought before the committee, he would plead the Fifth Amendment. Pagliano previously pleaded the Fifth Amendment in September 2015 when he was called before the congressional committee investigating the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Contempt of Congress is defined in statute 2 U.S.C.A. § 192 and is punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine and up to 12 months of imprisonment. In 2014, the House voted to find former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress and adopted a resolution calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRS targeting scandal. But federal prosecutors never prosecuted Lerner, instead determining she did nothing wrong by refusing to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",1,0,0
791,"America continues to be rocked by racial unrest and division, as the shooting of a black man in Charlotte, North Carolina sends folks into a frenzy of rioting and violence. Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by police yesterday, an incident about which race hustlers wasted no time in jumping to conclusions — and pushing narratives — particularly after the man’s daughter posted a video ranting that her father was disabled and unarmed. Police Chief Kerr Putney and his officers have a bit of a different take on the situation, however. They’ve just revealed the man was armed. Furthermore, Chief Putney says police gave him several warnings to drop the gun, which he refused to do. According to TheBlaze, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. Charlotte Police Chief: Officers gave loud, clear commands before shooting https://t.co/jZPnOfSwvC #KeithLamontScott https://t.co/UpzQj5qZwo — CNN (@CNN) September 21, 2016  “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. His comments were an apparent reference to a profanity-laced, hourlong video that a woman claiming to be Scott’s daughter posted to Facebook soon after the shooting, saying that her father had an unspecified disability and was unarmed. In it, she appears to be at the shooting scene, which is surrounded by yellow police tape, as she yells at officers. The woman did not respond to Facebook messages, and her claims could not immediately be verified by The Associated Press. It also was not clear if she witnessed the shooting. As of now, the facts surrounding this case are still coming in, so it’s difficult to make a final judgment on the whole situation. If Scott was indeed armed and refused to comply with police officers, then those on the scene had no choice but to use force to neutralize the threat posed by the suspect. What’s unfortunate is that so many folks in Charlotte — and across the nation — have jumped to conclusions, buying into the narrative that police officers are somehow a corrupt institution looking for new and creative ways to exterminate blacks. Our nation is in desperate need of healing along racial lines, but this will never happen as long as folks believe a false narrative they’re being spoon fed by liberals who want nothing more than to keep minorities enslaved to the Democratic Party.

To him, it’s annoying — but not in the way one might think. As black people — who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed — lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters: Trump and I believe there’s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement. Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of “Build that Wall.” Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or “talk” as Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn’t make it go away. The statistics tell us all we need to know: So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been “far too much” for his and Trump’s comfort. Newsflash, Pence: you’re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race. We already know Trump doesn’t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That’s been shattered. Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism. ",0,1,0

Veronica Welsh of Smithtown, NY called her students “racist” for doing absolutely nothing racist. They weren’t using racial slurs, they weren’t excluding minorities from their clubs, teams, groups, etc. They weren’t doing ANYTHING except, wait for it, wearing pro-Trump gear on USA day. These teachers are just part of a growing group of increasingly-liberal educators that have our children 7-8 hours a day. If this doesn’t frighten you, then you’re not paying attention.

Let’s not get into the fact that the First Amendment protects you from the government, not from being fired from your job for saying something outrageous. Are you being imprisoned? No? Alrighty then, you’re exercising your First Amendment rights and we’re exercising our right to hit back against your rhetoric. But let’s look into what punishment this teacher faced, because I think you might be surprised to hear what happened to her almost immediately after this nasty Facebook post hit the web.

1257,"A potential compromise is in the works that could result in more Hillary Clinton emails recovered by the FBI being made public before the election. Last week, a judge ordered the processing under the Freedom of Information Act of a relatively meager 1,050 pages of the FBI-found emails before Election Day. Government lawyers say the FBI turned over about 5,600 work-related Clinton emails to the State Department beginning in July, although some are duplicates of records already processed and released. During a court hearing in a separate FOIA lawsuit Monday, another judge pushed for a deal that could accelerate the release of those messages, perhaps three-fold, in advance of the Nov. 8 vote, in which Clinton is hoping to win the White House in a showdown with Donald Trump. Acting on a case brought by Vice News journalist Jason Leopold, U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras ordered the two sides to try to work out a compromise to devote more of State's resources to processing Clinton's emails in the coming weeks, rather than other records Leopold has requested. Contreras ordered both sides to report by Wednesday whether a deal can be reached to speed review of the FBI-found Clinton emails. Ryan James, an attorney for Leopold, said that if it was ""not possible"" for State to allocate more resources to the Clinton email disclosure, Leopold would be ""willing to sacrifice"" pages he's due of other Clinton-related records in order to get more of the emails released. About 2,200 pages of assorted records are scheduled for processing in the coming month in Leopold's case. Speaking of the FBI-recovered emails, James said: ""We believe those records are more important."" Initially, Justice Department attorney Robert Prince did not sound terribly receptive to the proposal. He that said the email-focused part of Leopold's suit against the State Department doesn't even encompass the full set of FBI-provided emails, and that Leopold previously agreed to limit the Clinton email-related portion of his suit to the roughly 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over on paper in December 2014. The Vice News reporter initially submitted a very broad request for almost every Clinton-related record at State, but later agreed to narrow it to Clinton emails, as well as other records on specific topics. But Contreras said it would be odd to penalize Leopold for not having foreseen that some emails would be obtained by the FBI. ""No one knew these documents existed ... and these documents should have been in the 55,000,"" the judge said. Prince said the fact they weren't in the roughly 54,000 pages of emails Clinton turned over did not necessarily reflect any impropriety. And there might be valid reasons these emails weren't in that set, he argued. ""Just because Secretary Clinton deleted an email does not mean anything untoward happened here,"" Prince said, noting that federal employees are generally not obliged to save all emails, even those that are-work related. ""I'm not suggesting that,"" replied Contreras, who issued the original order that led to State's public release of the 54,000 Clinton emails — a process that was completed in February. However, the judge said he believed both sides could work out a compromise that would reallocate some of State's resources to the Clinton email project. ""It seems to me that if the two of you actually spoke to each other, you could reach some agreement,"" Contreras said. ""I'm not going to order that everything be produced by Election Day. That's just impossible."" The judge called a recess in the hearing and ordered the two sides to confer about a possible arrangement. After a half-hour break, Prince returned to the courtroom shortly before noon to say that Justice Department and State Department lawyers handling the case were open to a reallocation of resources but needed approval from Eric Stein, a State Department FOIA official who could not immediately be reached. The potential deal was discussed again Monday afternoon during a separate hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss, who is overseeing a suit Leopold filed against the FBI for certain records related to the Clinton email probe. James, who appeared by phone at both hearings, referred at one point to a ""tentative agreement"" that he said would result in processing an additional 2,200 pages of Clinton emails for release by Oct. 31. That would be on top of the earlier order — issued in a case brought by the conservative group Judicial Watch — that State process 350 pages every two weeks, leading to releases on Oct. 7, Oct. 21 and Nov. 4. But Justice Department lawyer Jennie Kneedler said James was overstating how close the parties were to a deal. ""It's under consideration. I wouldn't describe it as a tentative agreement,"" Kneedler said. She also suggested, as Prince did at the earlier hearing, that with various records at various stages of the review process, suspending work on one set of records and moving people to another might not yield as many records as quickly as James was suggesting. ""As I'm sure your honor could appreciate, it's not a simple transfer for resources,"" Kneedler told Moss. Kneedler was unable to tell Moss where the FBI got the additional Clinton emails, although the Justice Department lawyer suggested some may have come from an email account longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin had on Clinton's server. The hearing before Moss proceeded on the assumption that if State determines the Clinton emails are entirely personal, they won't even be processed for release. However, since the records were obtained by the FBI in a criminal investigation, they could be FBI records even if not considered part of State's official files. That could result in partial release of some messages that are not work-related, even if State isn't processing them right now. During the morning hearing, Leopold's lawyer mounted a last-minute bid to try to get any additional emails that may be released sent ""directly"" to the Vice News reporter through his attorney, apparently in lieu of them being made public on State's website. The request echoed a debate among transparency advocates about whether records the government discloses should be immediately released to all via the Internet, or sent to the requester some time before everyone else gets them. Contreras turned down James' request that Leopold have first dibs on any additional emails. ""I'm happy with them posting it on the website. FOIA is about informing the public what their government is up to and that means everybody,"" the judge said. The issue did not arise before Moss, with all parties saying they expected any additional Clinton emails to be posted on State's website.

149,"World-renowned writer/director Joss Whedon has returned to social media with a vengeance and a message that needs to be heard by everyone. Especially those who are apparently severely apathetic to the election this year. The director and creator knows all too well that we canât sit this election out and has recruited some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry to get his message out there. His Save the Day PAC is described as such: âWe are a short-form digital productions company dedicated to the idea that voting is a necessary and heroic act. That every voice in this wonderfully diverse nation should, and must, be heard. That the only thing that can save democracy is the act that defines it. We are committed to fighting the apathy, cynicism, and honest confusion that keeps citizens from using their vote. And to reminding an increasingly out-of-touch and compromised set of representatives that they are answerable to the people they were hired to serve.â Itâs clear in the video that Donald Trump must be defeated for the good of all humanity, so it makes absolute sense that Whedon would use those who have played superheroes in his movies to get this very important message across. Itâs absolutely important that we all vote, not only for president, but also for legislators all the way down to the local level. This election defines not only who will lead the nation, but also who will sit on the Supreme Court, and as Whedonâs video points out, itâs a âtipping pointâ for the world. Sitting at home because you think both parties are equally as bad isnât only wrong, itâs dangerousÂ and allows that which we despise the most to gain power and control.

1550,"We still can’t believe this devastating news!!! As of Sunday evening, we have lost one of the most legendary men in our nation. Arnold Palmer has passed away at the age of 87 years old. Many people were shocked upon hearing this news. The golfing community is obviously devastated by the loss of such a legendary man. Upon hearing the news, the U.S. Golf Association released a saddening yet inspirational statement. “We are deeply saddened by the death of Arnold Palmer, golf’s greatest ambassador, at age 87,. Arnold Palmer will always be a champion, in every sense of the word. He inspired generations to love golf by sharing his competitive spirit, displaying sportsmanship, caring for golfers and golf fans, and serving as a lifelong ambassador for the sport.  Our stories of him not only fill the pages of golf’s history books and the walls of the museum, but also our own personal golf memories.  The game is indeed better because of him, and in so many ways, will never be the same.” He was known as “the King of Golf”, but was known for much more than that. Palmer received many awards in the sport as well as outside the sport.  Awards with high honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and more.  Every time Palmer accepted these awards, he offered some golf tips to whoever presented him with the awards…which was most of the time the President of the United States!  Anyone who came into contact with him, golfer or not, immediately encountered a good time. He knew how to relate to everyone, no matter the age, occupation or position they were in life. Palmer started out as an avid pilot who loved to play the game of golf. He attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship, which only grew his love for the sport even more. Palmer won his first tour during his rookie season in 1955, and the rest is history. Palmer brought a new attitude to golf. Unlike the other players, he took risks and tried things that ultimately may have made him look crazy from time to time. He wasn’t your average straight laced golfer, and that’s what made him rise to stardom as well as success in the golf world.  Palmer had a major influence on practically every golfer in the world. Upon hearing the devastating news, American golfer, Tiger Woods, expressed how impactful Palmer has been over the years. “Arnold meant everything to golf. Are you kidding me?. I mean, without his charisma, without his personality in conjunction with TV — it was just the perfect symbiotic growth. You finally had someone who had this charisma, and they’re capturing it on TV for the very first time. Everyone got hooked to the game of golf via TV because of Arnold.” Arnold will be missed by many people from many walks of life, as numerous people of high status and beyond have already started to mourn. Here's to The King who was as extraordinary on the links as he was generous to others. Thanks for the memories, Arnold. pic.twitter.com/UlyfpIBOL2 — President Obama (@POTUS) September 26, 2016  I just got the news at about 8:45 that Arnold had passed. I was shocked to hear that we lost a great friend (continued) pic.twitter.com/skehUsQgww — Jack Nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) September 26, 2016  We’re praying for the many friends and family Arnold has left behind. Long live the legend who did way more than just play the sport of golf. ",0,0,1
1347,"Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, the longest-serving head of the Justice Department's National Security Division who has overseen a flurry of high-profile terrorism and cyber espionage cases, will step down next month, officials said. Mary McCord is set to replace him as acting assistant attorney general on Oct. 15. Story Continued Below Carlin, 43, joined the National Security Division in 2009, only three years after it was established to consolidate the Justice Department's national security and intelligence functions, and was confirmed as head in 2014. He has overseen a robust increase in prosecutions for domestic terrorism, including the Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and steered the first conviction for attempting to construct a radiological device with the prosecution last year of Glendon Scott Crawford, a member of the Ku Klux Klan found guilty of planning to target unsuspecting Muslim-Americans with lethal doses of radiation. Attorney General Loretta Lynch praised his pioneering role. ""He oversaw the unprecedented indictment of five members of the Chinese military for cyber-enabled economic espionage and the investigation of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment’s computer systems,"" she said in a statement. ""And he forged crucial collaborations with our partners in the intelligence community, law enforcement and the private sector, enhancing our collective ability to detect and deter threats as they arise.” Since 2013, 110 individuals nationwide have been charged as foreign fighters for global terrorist groups, for engaging in violent extremism in the U.S. or for providing material support to the Islamic State, according to the Justice Department. “John Carlin is a dedicated public servant committed to upholding the rule of law, pursuing justice and keeping Americans safe,"" Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said in a statement. ""Throughout his distinguished career — most recently as assistant attorney general for national security — John has worked, largely behind the scenes, to do exactly that."" Carlin's division played an instrumental role earlier this year in several international computer hacking cases. Su Bin, a Chinese national, was sentenced to 46 months after pleading guilty to working with Chinese military officers to steal military technical data from U.S. defense contractors. Seven Iranian hackers were also indicted for working on behalf of private companies connected with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to deny service to the U.S. financial sector. One of the defendants was also indicted for compromising the industrial control system of the Bowman Dam in Rye, N.Y. Carlin previously served as the chief of staff to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller and was a federal prosecutor, serving as the national coordinator of the Justice Department’s Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Program and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. A Justice Department official said Carlin was not prepared to discuss his future plans, but predicted he'd be a big draw for the private sector.",1,0,0
1058,"As opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement look to prevent Congress from voting on the deal in the lame-duck session later this year, they have increasingly focused on one controversial section of the pact to make their case: the investor state dispute settlement system, or ISDS. ISDS allows foreign investors to sue host countries over regulations that affect their businesses. The cases are heard outside national courts by ad hoc tribunals that are empowered to award taxpayer-funded compensation. On the right, critics like Donald Trump claim the TPP would ""give up congressional power"" and cost America its ""economic independence."" Left-wing critics like Bernie Sanders are equally dour, claiming the pact ""undermines our sovereignty and subverts democratically passed laws including those dealing with labor, health and the environment."" Trump and Sanders overstate the novelty of this part of the TPP. ISDS has been included in thousands of pacts, including dozens involving TPP countries, most of which allow investors to pick the most favorable rules in a host state's treaty network. TPP didn't create the system, and rejecting it won't end it. But the critics have cause for concern. ISDS, as currently designed, allows investors to launch billion-dollar claims against governments for sometimes little more than making good on campaign pledges to their citizens. From Egypt to El Salvador, BuzzFeed's Chris Hamby reports, investors have invoked ISDS threats to obtain sweetheart settlements from governments. Some of those deals have put severe strain on national budgets. ""Shadow Courts,"" a new book by Time magazine's Haley Edwards, shows how ISDS threats have strained support for free trade around the world. Fixing ISDS should be a high priority for the next administration. In fact, such a fix would require just a few sentences of legislation to rein in the worst abuses of the system while upholding investor rights. In 1990, now-TPP advocates Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) helped enact the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act. This legislation allowed would-be legal disputes between American citizens and U.S. government agencies to be routed into binding arbitration. To address constitutionality concerns, a vital safeguard was built into the mix: third parties could appeal to U.S. courts to overturn an arbitration award if broader social interests were at risk. That legislation provided a template for my proposal to fix ISDS, which I presented at the American Political Science Association meetings earlier this month in Philadelphia. It leverages a little-appreciated aspect of the investment rules. Unlike weaker areas of international law, ISDS awards are enforced ultimately in national courts. Under current Supreme Court precedent, U.S. judges are instructed to defer to arbitral decisions. In other words, if a country loses a case in arbitration, it cannot appeal to national judges to overturn that decision because it was wrong or shortsighted. Under my proposal, this wouldn’t be the case. I proffer a so-called Equitable Investment Act. Just a few sentences long, this would give third parties a new right to petition U.S. courts to vacate arbitration awards that affect broader social interests. Here's how it would work in practice: Say a French bank sues Argentina under a bilateral Franco-Argentine treaty, alleging that a new Argentine administration's signature financial regulation plan cut into profits more than under a previous lighter-touch regime. Under the current ISDS system, the company could sue Argentina under the ISDS system and benefit from the possibility—however remote—that arbitrators would side with it and order cash payment. And under current federal arbitration laws, the bank would enjoy the near certainty that national courts would help enforce the award—with no review of the policy merits of the underlying claim. Under the Equitable Investment Act, in contrast, a U.S. court would be empowered to set aside the arbitrators' award if Argentine consumer groups showed it would harm their interests in a stable financial system back home. The legislation would presume that the U.S. has jurisdiction to review the award. While innovative, the proposal builds on existing practice. Already, U.S. courts can be asked to help attach Argentina's U.S. assets in such a dispute with French investors. The reform would simply expand their mandate and move up the timing of their involvement. Even if Argentine activists never used these rights, the possibility that they could would deter investors from challenging popular public interest policies. My proposal is doable in the first 100 days, even without a shift in the composition of Congress. Already, both parties have critiqued ISDS. Moreover, in a separate scuffle, a bipartisan coalition is poised to override President Obama's veto of a bill shredding the sovereign immunity in U.S. courts of foreign states linked to terrorism. With this standoff, legislators have shown themselves willing to strain diplomatic ties and risk loss of foreign sovereigns' investment in the U.S. In comparison, the relatively modest Equitable Investment Act would incentivize that money to return, as sovereigns facing overreaching ISDS claims would enjoy new protections for their assets. The impasse over ISDS points to a bigger problem: We lack a global governance system for investment that is coherent and fair enough to command popular support. Hillary Clinton has pledged to invent a ""new paradigm"" on investor-state dispute resolution, and Trump advisers have also called for change. But both Clinton and Trump are short on policy details. In the short term, they should take up this proposal. But in the long term, my stopgap measure will not be enough. New treaty rules are needed to put global governance on a more sustainable footing. Among other things, investors will be eager to move toward a system in which treaty outcomes are more certain. As part of a one-two punch with the changes to domestic arbitration law, the next administration should propose a global Equitable Investment Convention and call on other countries to sign up. My convention proposal would separate investor gripes into two tracks, which would better mirror our national laws' balance of property rights and democratic decision-making. First, states that expropriate property will have to compensate investors promptly and fairly. Instead of ISDS legal proceedings that take years to resolve and often deliver only pennies on investors' claims, teams of accountants would work to precisely tally the value of what investors sunk into their projects. States would then get a bill, which they could pay or challenge in a fast-tracked arbitration. Alternatively, if a state harmed an investor in less severe ways, arbitrators could still rule on whether and how the government fell short of its obligations. But unlike the current system, arbitrators would produce an advisory decision in six months. This document would not only find faults, but recommend specific reforms governments could make to come into compliance. States would accept or reject the advice, but they would be required to explain their choice and make all of the correspondence public. Most important, the Convention would fix ISDS' double standard. Instead of foreign investors enjoying rights that domestic investors, unions and environmental groups don't, the pact would level the playing field. Just as an investor can now ask a tribunal to determine whether capital controls violate a state's obligations, a union would be able to request a second opinion on collective bargaining rights. An environmental NGO could shine a spotlight on weak carbon emissions plans. And domestic investors could complain about preferential treatment received by wealthy foreign companies. These rulings will allow citizens to name and shame bad governments without compromising sovereignty. This proposal would accomplish what neither side of the TPP debate has promised: a path toward systemic reform of the over 3,000 ISDS pacts that already exist. Countries that joined the Convention would spare their investors from being dragged into U.S. courts under the Act. For any two countries that joined the Convention, their past deals would be automatically superseded—without time-consuming country-by-country negotiations. In a global economy, international and domestic law can check and improve each other. From trade wars to climate change to tax avoidance, we need to ensure that countries don't solve their problems at each other’s expense. International rules have a role to play, and independent adjudicators can be referees when the rules are in doubt. But the dialogue needs to be more dynamic—from arbitrators, to states, to the public, and back—if it's going to lead to better and more legitimate governance.

704,"The Children of Abraham of the Southern Tier, an interfaith organization in Johnson City, has taken offense at the 9/11 memorial raised in the nearby Town of Owego, New York. This association of misguided multiculturalists and Muslim moderates allege that identifying the perpetrators of the worst individual act of aggression on American soil would encourage Muslim hatred, never once excoriating the very act that resulted in the death and injury to more than 3,000 American victims and 453 responders and boundless grief for their families and for all Americans. Did the moderates ever attempt to apologize for the horrific crime that forced people to jump to their death rather than be burned alive? Did they express their sorrow for the victims and heroic rescue workers, or atone in a way to benefit the families that suffered such tragic loss? Do they even acknowledge that Islamic terrorists continue their march of evil, putting America and Europe on high alert for 9/11, or that this was part of Islam’s perpetual holy war against every living being on the planet. No. And the city manager’s overtures were also snubbed. The Muslim residents of Johnson City may be moderates who never take up a lethal weapon for Allah, but they are engaging in a subtle act of civilizational or settlement jihad. Such people are comparatively discreet in Western society, going about their lives inconspicuously, but effecting regime changes in gradual increments. By their refusal to acknowledge the obvious links between Islam and 9/11, they shield those who spew hatred against America, Israel and democracy; they empower the academics and students who vilify Israel and Jewish students on campus, and they facilitate the crossing of borders for hijra (conquest by increased population). Under the guise of injured sensibilities, they insist on the removal of anything that may identify those who pursue our destruction and conquest with Islam, hoping to erase the ugly truth that fourteen centuries of barbarism continues unabated in every country where Islam is found. They would have us believe that a tiny minority is to blame, but a recent Pew Research poll shows that 51 percent of American Muslims choose to be governed by sharia; 30% believe it is legitimate to use violence against those who insult Muhammed, the Koran, or Islam; 25 percent believe violence against Americans can be justified as part of the global jihad; and nearly 20% believe the use of violence in the US is justified in order to make sharia the law of the land. When presented with a choice when sharia conflicts with the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, 33% say sharia should be supreme. That’s some minority! Politically, 48% are Democrats, 19 percent Independents, and 19 percent Republicans. Islam already regulates our speech through our government, our media, and the constant hazard of being damned as Islamophobic to those who dare to speak up. They cover their tracks through leftist academics, a strong BDS movement, and textbooks crammed with indoctrinal and fallacious material. Continuing along those lines, the Johnson City assemblage is working to remove from future knowledge the history of 9/11 that was carved into the granite. If we fail to yearly observe significant events as the bombing of the World Trade Center, the signing of our Declaration of Independence, our victory in World War II, and more, our youth will be robbed of their identity, their heritage, and America as we know it. Wisdom is defense. Ignorance of our journey through history is the greatest threat to our survival. It should be noted that this interfaith group’s complaint was not that they, too, should have paid homage to America’s fallen or, specifically, to Owego’s citizen, Derek Statkevicus, who lost his life that day. Neither were they inspired to erect a monument in their own city or to join Owego residents in a fight against the greatest scourge of mankind with its unspeakable crimes done in the name of their religion. Rather, they express a phony outrage that the criminals have been identified with Islam! Often enough, other Islamic groups attempt to blame 9/11 on American citizens, on Jews or Christians, but this one is working to eliminate the obvious first, to claim that the 19 were unknown, came out of nowhere, and bombed America for no specific reason. Removing the offensive truth from the monument will leave room for revisionism later, just as Major Nidal Hassan (Fort Hood Massacre) was called anything but what he was, and his jihad massacre was officially named “workplace violence.” Instead of condemnation or owning up to the demands for death inherent in the Koran, these individuals hope to gradually erase the event from our memory and from generations to come – just as Islamists have obliterated or renamed many artifacts and historic tombs to create their own narrative, just as their counterparts in Israel are trying to stop archaeological excavations from revealing more of Jewish history. These Children of Abraham may well be the Islamic families that escaped tyranny but, unfortunately for the rest of us, they nurture their children with intolerance and harshness, creating a new, young generation of jihadists. These offspring may become the young men enticed online to join ISIS’ executioners, or the young women lured to sexual slavery for the Palestinian cause. We must continue to remind ourselves of the anger, the tears, and the patriotism that were triggered that day of September 11th, fifteen years ago, and realize that we are in more danger now than ever before. The Middle East has grown bolder and more violent. Islamists are acquiring newer, deadlier weapons, and more of their numbers are making their way into Europe, North and South America, bringing with them new plans to terrorize and infuse their way of life into ours. Islam has been at war with the world since the seventh century. Their holy book is a dedication to brutality and conquest, so that even their own people are condemned to grope in the darkness of oppression and poverty. In the name of their god, they must erase the past to support their own supersessionist narrative, and we must never oblige them. The more that Americans accommodate such requests and attempt to correct or crush our own speech, the more power we will hand to them. Unless we weigh the long-term ramifications of the growing adjustments we make to our lives for the sake of theirs, we will lose our freedoms to their tyrannical sharia laws. In the words of Hassan al-Banna, creator of the Muslim Brotherhood (1929), “It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its laws on all nations and extend its laws to the entire planet.” If the hate feared by the Children of Abraham does arise, it will be because of Islamists’ deeds, not the attribution on a memorial stone.

511,"(CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was informed about the traffic problems at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 as they were happening, according to the testimony Tuesday from a former Port Authority executive. While at Ground Zero during a 9/11 memorial event on September 11, 2013, Bill Baroni, the former Port Authority deputy executive director, and David Wildstein, the Port Authority director of interstate capital projects, had a discussion with Christie about the traffic issues, Wildstein testified Tuesday in federal court. The testimony is part of the trial for Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and Baroni, who have both pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures that caused the traffic problems, an incident that has come to be known by some as ""Bridgegate."" Christie has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or involvement with the lane closures, and he has never been charged with any crime related to the handling of the incident. At an unrelated event Tuesday, Christie publicly said his version of events has not changed and denied any wrong ""I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments,"" he said. ""I had no role in authorizing it. I had no knowledge of it and there has been no evidence ever put forward that I did."" At a lengthy news conference on January 9, 2014, a day after the revelation that an aide and adviser had a role in the lane closures, Christie said he ""had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election."" RELATED: Bridgegate trial: What to know ""You know, I could probably count on one hand the number of conversations I've had with David since he worked at the Port Authority,"" Christie said then. ""I did not interact with David."" Wildstein said in court that Baroni told Christie, ""Governor, I have to tell you there's a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee this morning, major traffic jams."" Wilstein said Baroni had a sarcastic tone during the conversation. The lane closures began two days prior on September 9. ""You'll be pleased to know that Mayor (Mark) Sokolich is having trouble getting his telephone calls returned,"" Baroni continued, according to Wildstein. Wildstein testified that Christie replied, ""I imagine he wouldn't be getting his calls returned."" Sokolich had not endorsed Chris Christie in his re-election bid. Previous testimony during this case illustrated an administration policy of ""radio silence"" the governor's office and the Port Authority implemented. Baroni then informed Christie that Wildstein was monitoring the traffic in Fort Lee. Later in the conversation, Christie reiterated that the Port Authority was to have no contact with Sokolich.

1125,"The hacker website that leaked Colin Powell's politically embarrassing emails struck again Thursday, this time releasing what appears to be the personal emails of a White House staffer working with Hillary Clinton’s campaign — and what purports to be an image of Michelle Obama’s passport. An initial scan of the messages appear to show chatter mostly regarding event planning details, such as requesting an invoice for a stage used at a Clinton campaign event. In one exchange, the advanced planning team expresses concern that the media might notice a group of protesters at one event. Story Continued Below The emails appear to be taken from the staffer's personal Gmail account, and span from February 2015 to July of this year. A Secret Service spokeswoman said the agency was “aware of the alleged email hacking of a White House employee.” “The Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,” spokeswoman Nicole Mainor told POLITICO. “As a matter of policy, we do not provide information regarding investigations.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to discuss the leak at his daily briefing. “Administration officials are taking a look at the information that’s been disclosed,” Earnest told reporters. “Obviously we take any reports about a cyber breach seriously, particularly if it may include some sensitive information.” Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters that the Justice Department is ""aware of those media reports."" ""It is something that we're looking into,"" she said. According to a LinkedIn page, the staffer has worked as an advance associate for the White House since April 2015. The staffer also appears to work with the Clinton campaign as an event organizer. The email dump was posted late Wednesday on the purported anti-secrecy site DC Leaks, which security experts have connected to the suspected Russian cyberattack campaign targeting U.S. political institutions and state election offices. Most notably, the site has also posted the pilfered private emails of Powell, as well as the alleged communications of other Clinton campaign workers and a few Republican lawmakers who have been critical of the Russian regime, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Early on Thursday, the DC Leaks Twitter account posted the purported image of Michelle Obama's passport. The emails may have been stolen during a previously reported cyberattack campaign that targeted at the personal email accounts of at least 26 Clinton campaign staffers and volunteers. Digital forensic experts have tied that digital assault to the same Russian hacking group that is believed to have also infiltrated other top Democratic institutions, including the Democratic National Committee.

If you love your country, I would hope you love it more than the NFL and football or any other sport… what these whining, wealthy athletes are doing is not only unpatriotic, it is racist and incendiary in nature. They are spoiling for a race war. Three Philadelphia Eagles players raised their fists in the sign for Black Power at their game in Chicago on Monday night during the National Anthem. It was disgraceful and I think I’ve had just about enough of this crap. Ever since Colin Kaepernick started this cop-hating gesture by sitting and then kneeling during the National Anthem, it has had me furious. I’ve seen it spread to colleges and high schools. I’ve seen it infect other sports as well. It should not be tolerated by these teams… it’s just that simple. It doesn’t help that Barack and Michelle Obama have done it as well… it is a radical, racist gesture and unacceptable. I accept it no more than I would accept a Nazi salute – they are both disgusting and hateful. Even Sports Illustrated has bowed to Black Lives Matter. From Gateway Pundit: It’s an Obama world.

Especially since just days ago a black man ambushed a female police officer in her patrol car in Philadelphia, shooting her eight times. Her vest saved her, but the guy shot five others, killing one, before he was brought down. Doing the Black Power salute only makes all of that worse and inflames racial and police tensions even more. These players live in the freest country in the world, where they have made millions and live privileged lifestyles. Yet they hate America, her military and the police who protect their sorry asses. Obama took a colorblind society and turned it into a race war waiting to happen. Now, everything is about race and you have Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam getting away with racial incitement and violence threatened and realized. These players deserve far more than a boycott. They deserve to be banned from their sports over this. There should be consequences for stoking the fires of racial animosity and the hatred of American heroes.  ",0,0,1
1241,"Monday night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be a battle of facts—and, perhaps more likely, half-facts and flat-out lies. Both candidates, after all, have called out for being exceptionally untrustworthy in a profession that’s not known for its uprightness. At the New Yorker, David Remnick has said of Clinton, “[She] has had her bald-faced moments—moments that are too kindly described as ‘lawyerly,’” while Nicholas Kristof recently wrote, “If deception were a sport, Trump would be the Olympic gold medalist.” When number crunchers are on the case, the candidates don’t fare much better: Politico Magazine recently fact-checked a week’s worth of each candidate’s statements, and found that Trump had uttered one untruth every 3.25 minutes and Clinton, every 12 minutes. In fact, just half of Clinton’s factual assertions have been found to be “true” or “mostly true” by the nonpartisan fact-checkers at Politifact, and Trump’s statements only come in at a pitiful 15 percent. Little wonder that polling shows more than half of likely voters don’t think either candidate is honest, the highest level of distrust in recent elections. Story Continued Below This heightened concern about truthfulness has prompted heated conversations about whether debate moderators should be responsible for live fact-checking. (Clinton says yes, Trump no.) But viewers can prepare themselves regardless: Knowing that we’re in for gale-force fabrications on Monday, how can you steel yourself for the lies ahead? Todd Rogers, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, has published two major studies about deception and how audiences respond to it. He has identified five tactics that are mainstays in American politics—and why they often work on us. Here’s a guide to those five types of deception and how they’ve been deployed in recent political history. 1. Artful Dodging What it is: Answering a different question than the one that was asked—not quite a lie, but an evasion. When you’ve seen it: Nearly all political debates feature at least one dodge, also known as a “pivot.” In one Republican primary debate, Trump was asked, “Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached?”—to which his response started, “First of all, I have to say, as a businessman I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world.” (The rest of his response didn’t answer the question either.) In one of Clinton’s primary debates, she avoided a direct answer about the content of her Goldman Sachs speeches even when pressed. Why it works: Rogers has found that viewers’ limited attention is tied up in deciding whether they like a candidate, not whether the candidate is actually responding to the question. Since many dodges go undetected, candidates don’t often lose points for them. In fact, in the same study, speakers who eloquently answered a similar question were rated as highly as those who inartfully answered the actualquestion. 2. Paltering What it is: Actively using truthful statements to lead a listener to a false conclusion. When you’ve seen it: The best-known political example is probably Bill Clinton’s line during an interview about the Monica Lewinsky scandal: “There is no sexual relationship with that woman,” a sly but truthful use of the present tense to obscure past misdeeds. (Five days later, he upgraded to full-blown lie with “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”) Trump has also used this tactic when asked about the bankruptcy of Trump Entertainment Resorts: “Seven years ago, I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City.” The facts are true, but the statement misleadingly recasts a business failure in a positive light. Why it works: Paltering is hard to pick up on, since you’re technically hearing the truth. And Rogers’ research shows that even when outside observers know it’s happening, they consider it more benign than outright lies of commission (see below). 3. Explicit Avoidance What it is: Flat-out refusing to engage with a sticky subject. When you’ve seen it: Politicians use this tactic when they refuse to release their tax returns, like Trump, or medical records, like Hillary Clinton. More often, you see it when politicians or their spokespeople employ the classic “no comment,” or a similar sentiment, as when Bernie Sanders responded to a question about the failures of Venezuela’s socialist model with: “Of course I have an opinion, but as I said, I’m focused on my campaign.” Clinton has done him one better, refusing for much of the campaign to face the press at all (and earning considerable criticism for it). Why it works: Actually, it doesn’t. Rogers’ colleagues have demonstrated that listeners trust and prefer people who reveal to people who hide, even when the information is damaging. 4. Lying by Commission What it is: Saying something you know to be untrue in order to mislead your audience. When you’ve seen it: Politicians most often employ straight-up lies when denying involvement in a scandal. See: Anthony Weiner’s initial denial that he’d sent anyone a close-up photo of his underwear,saying, “This was a prank, a hoax.” Or the response by Congressman Mark Foley’s camp to allegations that he’d sent inappropriate messages to congressional pages: “[This is part of an] an ugly smear campaign.” In this election cycle, Trump has famously clung to the false assertion that he always opposed the Iraq War. Why it works: This tactic can backfire if detected—both Weiner and Foley resigned under pressure, after all. But plenty of political mistruths have remarkable staying power even after being debunked, like claims, long disseminated by Trump, that Barack Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya. 5. Lying by Omission What it is: Failing to disclose a piece of relevant information or context, which renders a statement untrue. When you’ve seen it: In promoting the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama and his team made a number of statements like, “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.” This wasn’t strictly true—you could only keep your plan if it hadn’t changed since the ACA was passed. More recently, Trump has trumpeted the virtues of American manufacturing while failing to mention that several Trump products are made overseas. And Clinton’s handling of her private email server could be viewed as one extended lie of omission, since she and her team have provided incomplete information and records on multiple occasions. Why it works: If the public believes something untrue but desirable about a candidate, failure to correct the misperception works in the candidate’s favor. And research has suggested that people prefer tellinglies of omission to lies of commission. Not only is the former therefore more common—it’s also harder to hold people accountable for something they didn’t say than something they did. Still, lies of omission can work against candidates if audiences suspect they’re not being told the whole story. Of course, lies of omission are designed not to de detected—just like other forms of deception. But by studying up on Rogers’ taxonomy of deceit, perhaps debate viewers will better be able to pick up on any misleading tactics the candidates choose to deploy.",1,0,0
254,"(CNN)On the campaign battlefield, Donald Trump follows a doctrine of disproportionate force. Even 50 days out from the election, after countless attempted ""pivots"" to a steadier pose, his impulses -- to meet even a modest political jab, unflattering piece of reporting, or polite interruption with deeply personal attacks -- remain mostly unchecked. He was back at it this weekend with harsh assaults on a former defense secretary and a New York Times columnist. During the long primary season, Trump responded to criticism from his opponents with mocking nicknames and scornful insults. Then it was Hillary Clinton's turn. Along the way, the parents of a slain war hero, a federal judge, reporters, and even a pastor from Flint, Michigan, have been confronted with the same lopsided tactics. Here are some of Trump's most pointed reprisals. Hints that former Defense Sec. Bob Gates has 'a problem' Robert Gates has some concerns with Donald Trump. The former defense secretary, who served under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, called the Republican nominee ""cavalier"" and ""willfully ignorant"" in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week. The piece was also frequently critical of Clinton, but called Trump beyond repair. ""He's a nasty guy,"" Trump said Saturday of Gates, whom he also called ""an absolute clown."" ""Probably has a problem that we don't know about."" Trump has not elaborated on the nature of the ""problem."" Earlier in the day, the Republican nominee, in a tweet, assigned Gates a nickname -- ""dopey"" -- before criticizing him for speaking ""badly of his many bosses, including Obama."" It wasn't the first time Trump seemed to chalk up their differences to a lack of facetime. ""He knows nothing about me"" he tweeted. ""But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!"" Describes Flint pastor as a ""nervous mess"" When Rev. Faith Green Timmons briefly interrupted him, asking that he steer clear of political attacks, during a speech at her church in Flint, Michigan, Trump promptly quit and reversed course. ""OK, that's good,"" he said, almost sheepishly. ""Then I'm going back onto Flint, OK?"" He did -- and it was. For a few hours. But by the next morning, Trump was lashing out at the pastor, calling her a ""nervous wreck."" ""She was so nervous, she was shaking,"" he told Fox News. ""And I said, 'wow, this was kind of strange.' And then she came up. So she had that in mind, no question about it."" Critical women = 'neurotic' On the subject of nervous conditions: Trump responded to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who told CNN on Saturday that the candidate ""thought the violence (at rallies) added a frisson of excitement,"" in a familiar tone. In the first of two tweets, he called Dowd ""wacky"" and a ""neurotic dope."" A minute later, she was ""crazy."" If that looks familiar, it's because Trump has repeatedly used the same language to insult other female critics. In August, it was MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski. ""Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning, unwatchable!,"" he tweeted. Brzezinski ""is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess! And about a month earlier, when now-former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned ahead of the party's convention in Philadelphia, Trump chimed in by calling her ""highly neurotic."" A couple weeks earlier, after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called Trump ""a faker"" -- a comment for which she would later apologize -- he took a similar shot at her mental state. ""Her mind is shot,"" he tweeted. ""Resign!"" Repeated swipes at the family of slain war hero Trump targeted the parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, killed in 2004 by a suicide bomber in Iraq, in a prolonged back-and-forth in the days after the Democratic National Convention. In an impassioned speech on the convention's final night, Khizr Khan, the soldier's father, said to Trump, ""You have sacrificed nothing and no one,"" then offered to lend the GOP nominee a copy of his pocket-sized U.S. Constitution. The barb did not sit well. Trump first suggested that the slain soldier's mother, who stood quietly by her husband's side during his remarks, had been muzzled by her religion. ""His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say,"" Trump said during an interview with ABC News. ""Maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say."" (A day later, Mrs. Khan explained in an op-ed that she had been silenced only by her grief.) Upset that Khizr Khan appeared on television after his speech, he continued his barrage on Twitter, first writing, ""Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!"" Then, 17 minutes later: ""This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!"" Calls reporter a 'sleaze' during a news conference Before he mostly shut out the press and eschewed news conferences, Trump gathered the media at New York's Trump Tower in late May to provide information and answer questions about his fundraising for veterans groups. But the Republican nominee soon maligned the press for not offering what he considered to be proper credit for his charitable giving. ABC News reporter Tom Llamas called out Trump for exaggerating the initial totals. ""Mr. Trump, writing a $1 million check is incredibly generous, but the night of the Iowa fundraiser, you said you had raised $6 million,"" Llamas began. ""Clearly you had not. Your critics say you tend to exaggerate, you have a problem with the truth. Is this a prime example?"" Trump immediately rejected the math, saying he expected the number would eventually surpass $6 million, then turned on Llamas, eventually calling him ""a sleaze."" When a reporter asked if a Trump presidency would take on a similar tone, the billionaire businessman responded, ""Yeah, it is going to be like this."" ""You think I'm going to change?"" he said. ""I'm not going to change."" References judge's 'Mexican' heritage after court ruling After U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel ordered the since-shuttered Trump University's ""playbooks"" to be made public, the candidate and his allies launched a series of attacks centered on Curiel's Latino background. ""This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. But I have judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater,"" Trump told supporters at a rally in May, saying Curiel is ""we believe, Mexican, which is great."" Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson then suggested on CNN's ""New Day"" that Curiel's membership in La Raza Lawyer's Association made him biased and tried to tie him to anti-Trump protesters. Slams conservative opponent Bill Kristol over opposition In late May and June, Trump launched a days-long offensive against Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, a Never-Trumper who was recruiting a conservative third-party challenger. ""If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an independent, say goodbye to the Supreme Court!"" Trump tweeted, before doubling down at press conference days later, when he labeled Kristol a ""loser,"" ""not a smart person"" and ""such a fool."" Elizabeth Warren as 'Pocahontas' When Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren sought to match Trump's Twitter fire, using some of the same harsh language he has made a staple of the campaign, he responded in kind -- and upped the ante, repeatedly calling her ""Pocahontas,"" a reference to the 2012 controversy over her claimed Native American heritage. Since Warren emerged as one of his chief antagonists, Trump has been unyielding in his attacks. ""I find it offensive that goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard,"" he tweeted last week. (Warren, a former Harvard professor, noted in her response that she did not attend the college as a student.) Trump in March interrupted a reporter trying to ask a question about Warren, asking sarcastically, ""Who's that, the Indian? You mean the Indian?"" Repeated attacks on Megyn Kelly Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has been targeted repeatedly by Trump after she asked a pointed question about his past remarks regarding women at the first GOP debate last August. Initially retweeting supporters who called her a ""bimbo"" and other offensive terms, Trump dialed it up a couple days later. ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon during an interview about the exchange. ""Blood coming out of her wherever."" Trump has launched sporadic volleys of invective against Kelly in the months that followed, calling her ""crazy"" and calling for a ""boycott"" of her show. The current detente followed a private meeting and then an interview special, but not before Fox News put out a press release labeling Trump's ""sick obsession"" with Kelly as being ""beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land."" Turning on Ted Cruz -- big league It seems like a while back now, but Trump and his old primary rival Ted Cruz began the political season in a rather chummy pose. The Texas senator refrained from criticizing the billionaire businessman even as Trump mocked John McCain last July for having been captured and held as POW during the Vietnam War. During debates, Cruz mostly kept his distance from the front-runner, repeatedly dodging opportunities to poke him. But as the campaign heated up and the field dwindled, Cruz went on the attack. Trump's response was devastating. Cruz quickly became ""Lyin' Ted"" and, before it was all over, Trump had threatened to ""spill the beans"" on the senator's wife and repeatedly peddled a conspiracy theory linking his father to JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald.

963,"At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday. The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported. Story Continued Below The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau. The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship. ""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed."" In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked. “This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”",1,0,0
1539,"Tragedy has left the Miami Marlins team in devastation. Their friend, colleague and someone they probably considered family, has died in a tragic accident. Such unexpected shocking loss is not an experience to wish on anyone.  Jose Fernandez, their pitcher, was killed in a boating accident Sunday morning. It was just last week he had posted a picture on social media of his girlfriend who had an obvious ‘baby bump’ in an announcement that they were expecting their first child. In its caption, he told the world he thanked his girlfriend for coming into his life and expressed his excitement for their future together as a family. A news conference was held by his team after learning of his death and the team’s manager, Don Mattingly, was very visibly shaken during the conference, in tears over the loss of his team player and friend. “I see such a little boy,” Mattingly said. “The way he played, there was just joy with him when he played.” When the news conference was over, left fielder, Christian Yellich and the team’s second baseman, Dee Gordon, embraced and walked out somberly with other team members. A loss like this, so unexpected… was visibly painful watching them trying to get a grip on the situation. Earlier, Gordon had walked out to the mound at Marlins Park, where the grounds crew had painted a “16” — Fernandez’s number — and placed a Marlins cap. Gordon stood looking at the tribute before kneeling down in a moment of silent reflection. “Sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said in a statement.  We are stunned and devastated by the tragic news that Jose Fernandez, 24, has died in a boating accident. https://t.co/QIBcnIYJ1i pic.twitter.com/SDZoL6NMEb — MLB (@MLB) September 25, 2016    I will miss you… Sorry if i never told you how valuable your friendship was too me… pic.twitter.com/HzstRZDBri — Tom Koehler (@TKREFRESH22) September 25, 2016    You loved striking me out, and teasing me about it.

1353,"Despite a lack of evidence, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean is refusing to apologize for insinuating on Twitter that Donald Trump might be a “coke user” – instead, he claimed Tuesday that the Republican presidential nominee’s “grandiosity” and “delusions” are characteristic of cocaine use, while acknowledging that it’s unlikely he actually has a drug problem. As the nominees debated at Hofstra University in New York on Monday night, Dean – a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton in the race – tweeted: “Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user?” Story Continued Below The comment reverberated around the Twittersphere – it’s been retweeted some 26,000 times – but also drew criticism for being a low blow and a conspiracy theory. MSNBC’s Kate Snow, speaking with Dean on Tuesday afternoon, asked, “Why did you go there?” Dean, who is a physician, clarified that he was not actually assigning Trump a cocaine addiction diagnosis – “You can't make a diagnosis over the television; I would never do that,” he said – but maintained that Trump’s sniffling, as seen at the debate, “is actually a signature of people who use cocaine.” Then he pivoted the discussion to argue that Trump should release his tax returns and more detailed medical records. “He sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do,” Dean said, and then attributed a series of other characteristics to Trump that he said “accompanies that problem.” He has “grandiosity,” “delusions” and “trouble with pressured speech” and “couldn't keep himself together” on Monday, Dean said. “I think it would be interesting to ask him and see if he ever had a problem with that.” “I just was struck by the sniffing and then by his behavior, which all sort of came together, these four symptoms,” Dean continued. “You know, do I think he has a cocaine habit? I think it's unlikely that you could mount a presidential campaign at 70 years old with a cocaine habit, but it’s striking.” Snow pushed back, comparing Dean’s comments to theories propagated by Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani earlier in the race, questioning Clinton’s health. “You don’t see the parallel?” she asked. “Donald Trump has not only not made his tax returns public, he’s also not made his medical history public in any meaningful way,” Dean responded. “Hillary Clinton has done that and has answered any question that Giuliani may want to raise.” And, Dean told Snow, he has no plans to apologize for the comment, or delete the tweet. “I don’t think this is a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night. Do I think it was cocaine? Probably not,” he said. “This guy’s already proving himself to be unstable. The question is, why is he unstable?” Republican National Committee chief strategist Sean Spicer said on MSNBC on Tuesday that it was “pretty pathetic and unreal” for “someone who has been a governor, a presidential candidate and, most importantly, a medical doctor to make that prognosis with no fact.”",1,0,0
660,"So I guess it is back to school for everyone.  I am not really too sure, as the last time I was in a classroom they actually taught curriculum that benefitted students.  I saw an interesting article in Breitbart today which read: “Northwestern President: Critics of Safe Spaces, Trigger Warnings are ‘Lunatics'”.   The article, which appeared in Northwestern University’s student rag newspaper, The Daily Northwestern, was based on a speech given by NU President Morton Schapiro.  I know that listening to libtards is enough to make any of my readers lose their lunch, so I will simply hit the high points.  In his speech Schapiro said: “The people who decry safe spaces do it from their segregated housing places, from their jobs without diversity — they do it from their country clubs. It just drives me nuts.” And about microaggression, what did this academic sainte have to say? “Microaggressions cut you to the core and aren’t easily forgotten…” Ok, first things first: According to his bio, Morton Schapiro has never worked a day in his life outside of academics.  While his resume might sound impressive it has all been in schools and colleges.  This is important because it means that he has nothing in common with the students that will eventually have to graduate his college and, gasp in horror, find a job. Dr. Schapiro told students that ““Look for those safe spaces. If you can’t find them, we will help you find them.”  Alright, call me a sadist, but I would love to be a fly on the wall when one of NU’s students goes into a job interview and starts talking about safe spaces.  Hey buttercup, the real world doesn’t have those!  What are you going to do, little snowflake, when you meet a co-worker or even a boss who says things that you consider “microaggressive”?  Are you going to run to your safe space and hide in your blanket fort whilst sipping a juice box?  Are you going to sit there in a boardroom during a meeting and cry because someone said something that goes against what you believe?  If you can answer yes to both of those questions then you will not be employed for too long.  To survive in the real world you need a level of self discipline and a really, really tough skin.  The working world is tough, it’s a lot tougher when you are a wuss. The whole purpose of college is to prepare its students for the real world not only by teaching them academics that can get them jobs, but also by preparing them for a tough, cold world.  Well, at least that use to be its purpose.  Now the purpose of college is to brainwash and coddle, making spineless wimps out out of the strong and airheads out of the smart.  Today’s colleges are run by administrators and teachers who have never worked a day in the private sector.  They teach theory, not reality.   Students come out with student debts in the hundreds of thousands without the skills necessary to survive in the working world.  I shudder to think that these entitled wusses will someday be running the country. I motion that Northwestern University change its name to Wussy U.  And, if you don’t like it, I will be in my blanket fort, sipping my juice box. ",0,0,1
104,"Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown. Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then. Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom. For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason. For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:  Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you. The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr. Featured image by Gage Skidmore",0,1,0
784,"Weirdest thing, United States Immigration made a mistake. Just kidding it’s not weird, in fact they just caught themselves making 858 mistakes when they mistakenly granted citizenship to immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud. Oopsie. Don’t worry government everyone makes mistakes and it’s only OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK!!!!! I mean c’mon guys, this isn’t like accidentally leaving the onion on a burger when the customer says ‘hold the onion’. A human being and their paperwork is much larger than a burger. Homeland Security Department’s inspector general found that these particular immigrants used different names and birthdates and their fingerprints were missing from the database. The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the United States — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS officials identified an additional 953 people who had been naturalized despite outstanding deportation orders, though auditors couldn’t determine if those immigrants had digital fingerprints on file or not. Roth’s report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants’ files to add fingerprints to the digital record. The biggest danger in mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone who should be deported is that as a US Citizen they would be able to apply for jobs that require security clearance. So far 3 of these mistaken ‘citizens’ acquired aviation and transportation credentials. A 4th person had become a law enforcement officer. For now immigration and DHS are scrambling to fill the holes in the files and implement a system to evaluate each case of the immigrants improperly granted citizenship. ",0,0,1
1483,"What would you do if you were faced with an angry mob shutting down the stretch of road that you’re on? You approach the group and apply the brakes, wondering if they’ll move for you, but not only do they not make any effort to get out of your way, they start coming toward you. Remembering the Reginald Denny affair, you realize that you’re faced with two options: floor it and risk hurting one of the protesters, or stop and risk them hurting you, or worse.  What do you do? Maybe it was the way I was raised, but I learned that if you feel threatened and you feel as if it ultimately comes down to you or the person who you believe is planning to do you harm, the answer is absolutely, 100% self-preservation. Apparently, I’m not the only one with this set of beliefs. An incident took place on the campus of the Eastern Michigan University that proves that if you try to shut down a road in protest, you do so at your own risk. Watching the video below, you can see that black protesters have completely taken over the street. One small jeep, however, clearly has places to be that aren’t right there at that moment. The driver hits the gas pedal and speeds forward, bumping over a protester. Watch the video below:   In case you were wondering if they were upset about the Charlotte shooting, the answer is “no.” Instead, they were upset about the words “KKK” and “Leave N*****s” painted on the side of the school. The words were removed and the school issued an apology, but it was too late, BLM was outraged. Make no mistake, it’s better to be arrested for running over a protester than to be killed and/or have your property stolen by them because they think they’re entitled to it due to someone painting some mean words on the side of a building. “Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6,” doesn’t only apply to protecting your home and family, but yourself as well. There is no good reason to stop while surrounded by irrationally angry people who just want violence to come to you and anyone else they deem “guilty” of whatever crime they’ve made up today. What would you do if you were in this situation? Would you stop, or would you put the pedal to the floor? ",0,0,1

Recently Underwood was in Nashville performing one of her shows. During the middle of it, she paused to talk about a great woman and role model in the country music industry, Dolly Parton. Underwood then went on to sing one Parton’s hit songs, ‘I Will Always Love You.’ After she was done with the beautiful rendition, she paused to thank a special group of people in her life. Underwood explained that she couldn’t make it through certain times without strong women helping and guiding her along the way. “I have learned a lot about a whole incredible group of amazing women over the past year and a half of my life. I’ve gained just an incredible appreciation for moms — for my own mother and for the mothers of my friends and just people that I know that have had kids. I never knew what it was like to just juggle everything and try to be everything to everyone.” All of those words were said through tears streaming down the star’s face. She was genuine and heartfelt about everything she was saying. You can tell that she’s been impacted tremendously by this group of ladies.  After she said all of that, she encouraged all of her fans. She let everyone know that she appreciates them and their support so much. Then she laughed as she let the crowd know that she may not make it through her next song, which was “What I Never Knew I Always Wanted.” Carrie never fails to make every moment real and heartfelt. It’s something that we as fans absolutely adore about her. She has never let her fame and success get in the way of showing love, kindness and gratefulness to everyone. Watch the amazing moment below!  We love you, Carrie!! ",0,0,1
106,"Reince Priebus openly threatened Kasich and other Republicans that they better blindly support Donald Trump or face the end of their careers. John Kasich doesnât give a shit about Priebusâ pathetic threats. On Sunday, the GOP Chair suggested that Republicans who donât fall in line behind Trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election. âThose people need to get on board,â Priebus told : âAnd if theyâre thinking theyâre going to run again someday, I think that weâre going to evaluate the process â of the nomination process and I donât think itâs going to be that easy for them. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. So whatâs the penalty for that? Itâs not a threat, but thatâs just the question that we have a process in place.â Kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump and did not take kindly to Priebusâ threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman John Weaver. âThankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich doesâ¦The Governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot Republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on Reinceâs watch.â Weaver also added that Priebus should be thanking Kasich. So the next time John Kasich seeks re-election or high office itâs going to be interesting to watch how Priebus responds. Will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support Kasich? Threatening someone with political ruin just because they donât support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. Itâs definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. Because by trying to force Republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon. If anyone deserves political backlash, itâs Reince Priebus. He created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have Trump as their leader. The Republicans standing against Trump are the sane ones. ",0,1,0

644,"Hillary Clinton says that Christians are bigoted and deplorable. They are discriminator using ‘code talk’ in her opinion. You know how liberals decry stereotyping of groups? That does not seem to slow them down in their treatment of conservatives and Christians. Oh, and they are homophobic and Islamophobic as well. Geez. Read more below!  As Written By Ken Klukowski for Breitbart: Hillary Clinton: Christians are Bigoted and Deplorable, ‘Religious Liberty’ Code for Discrimination. Christians across America should be terrified by Hillary Clinton’s denouncing of Trump supporters as “bigoted” people who are so “deplorable” that they are “irredeemable,” because she was primarily talking about people of faith, as reflected by one of her top Democratic supporters just one day before Clinton’s infamous speech. While many commentators were stunned by Clinton’s comments, most have overlooked the setting and context. Clinton was speaking in New York City at an LGBT event. And she specified that the “bigoted” and “irredeemable” people she was denouncing are both homophobic and Islamophobic. Observant Christians in 2016 are repeatedly called bigoted and homophobic for holding to biblical teaching and church doctrine that marriage is between a man and a woman, that sexuality should be expressed only between married couples, and that a person’s sex is part of how God deliberately made them, and is something they should embrace. These leftists also say that these observant Christians are anti-woman because believing in protecting the life of the unborn is a form of “discrimination.” Clinton’s charge of Islamophobia was broadly cast against Americans who raise concerns regarding what certain segments within Islam—not all Muslims, but rather those who adhere the versions that embrace violence and jihad—believe and whether this should…..

1100,"Donald Trump has pulled ahead of Hillary Clinton among likely voters in a trio of swing states, according to a Fox News poll released Wednesday evening. In a four-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Trump leads Clinton 43 percent to 40 percent in Nevada, 45 percent to 40 percent in North Carolina and 42 percent to 37 percent in Ohio. Story Continued Below Johnson polled at 8 percent in Nevada and at 6 percent in both North Carolina and Ohio. The only state in which Stein registered any support was Ohio, where she polled at 2 percent. President Barack Obama won all three states in 2008 and took Ohio and Nevada in his 2012 reelection campaign. All three are essential for Trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the White House relative to Clinton. The Fox News poll is good news for the Trump campaign after a fresh NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released earlier Wednesday showed Clinton with a 6-point lead nationwide. The Fox poll also shows Republican Senate candidates in each state with leads over their Democratic opponents. The biggest advantage of the three belongs to incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, who leads former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland 51 percent to 37 percent. Another incumbent, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, leads Democrat Deborah Ross by 6 points, 43 percent to 37 percent, while GOP Rep. Joe Heck leads Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto by 7points, 43 percent to 36 percent, in the race to fill outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid’s Nevada Senate seat. In North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory holds a small lead despite the still-swirling controversy surrounding his decision to sign into law a bill perceived by many to be discriminatory against transgender individuals. The incumbent GOP governor leads his Democratic challenger, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, by a 3-point margin, 46 percent to 43 percent. The Fox News poll was conducted Sept. 18-20 via both landlines and cellphones. It reached 704 likely voters in Nevada, 734 in North Carolina and 737 in Ohio.

995,"NEW YORK — There's at least one Muslim country that Donald Trump has ""great respect"" for. The Republican presidential nominee Monday showered Egypt's increasingly autocratic ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with kind words during a special meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Story Continued Below Trump, who has called for a ban on immigration from countries ""compromised by terrorism,"" which presumably would include Egypt, promised to invite Sisi to visit the White House if he's elected president. Trump also suggested he'd like to visit Egypt. In a strikingly praise-filled summary of the meeting released by his campaign, the Republican was said to express to Sisi ""his strong support for Egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Trump also was said to have ""emphasized"" to Sisi ""his high regard for peace-loving Muslims."" The statement came the same day that the real estate mogul, responding to a suspected terrorist attack in New York, lamented that police officers weren't allowed to use racial profiling. Sisi also met with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Both the 2016 candidates have been criticized by people across the political spectrum for sparing any time for Sisi, whose harsh rule has infuriated human rights activists. But Egypt is still considered a vital ally for the United States, not least because it maintains a peace deal with Israel and is a relatively stable Arab country in an increasingly volatile Middle East. It also is considered an important partner in the battle against Islamist militancy. The meeting between Trump and Sisi also included Trump advisers, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the readout, Trump expressed ""great respect for Egypt’s history"" and a ""great fondness"" for the Egyptian people. The readout did not say what Sisi said in return to Trump. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday from POLITICO.",1,0,0
968,"An oil industry executive who has spoken out against animal rights is a leading contender for Interior secretary should Donald Trump win the White House, two sources familiar with the campaign’s deliberations told POLITICO on Monday — a prospect that drew immediate condemnation from environmental activists. Forrest Lucas, the 74-year-old co-founder of oil products company Lucas Oil, is well-known in his native Indiana, where in 2006 he won the naming rights to Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts football team, for a reported $121.5 million over 20 years. He and his wife have given a combined $50,000 to the gubernatorial campaigns of Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, according to Indiana state records. Story Continued Below Lucas’ company, California-based Lucas Oil, is a fast-growing manufacturer of automotive oils, lubricants and other additives used in everything from cars to heavy-duty trucks. One person briefed by the Trump campaign said Lucas is a “front-runner” for the Interior secretary job. The person, who was granted anonymity to talk about private discussions, added that Trump wants a “more business-friendly and business experience-heavy cabinet.” But environmentalists quickly excoriated the idea of an oil industry executive leading the department that oversees national parks and wildlife refuges, along with decisions about offshore drilling, fracking regulations and protections for endangered species. ""Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump's promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he's elected,"" said Khalid Pitts, the Sierra Club's national political director. David Turnbull, the campaigns director at anti-fossil-fuels group Oil Change USA, worried that Trump's Cabinet could be full of people with ties to the oil industry. They include Harold Hamm, the CEO of Oklahoma oil company Continental Resources, who has emerged as a possible pick for Trump's energy secretary. ""Catering to an industry dead-set on continued expansion of oil and gas drilling is not only totally out of step with climate science, but it's also out of step with the majority of Americans who are calling for a swift transition to clean energy and robust action on climate change,"" Turnbull said in an email. It would be nearly unprecedented for major oil executive to get the top job in the Interior Department. Current Secretary Sally Jewell was an engineer for Mobil Oil early in her career and often touts her experience fracking wells, although she is best known as a conservationist and former outdoor retail executive. Lucas’ nomination would be a coup for the oil and gas industry, which has battled President Barack Obama’s Interior Department for years over everything from Endangered Species Act listings to access to federal lands for drilling. Trump has cultivated close ties to the oil industry, which was once skeptical of his campaign for president. ""In a lot of ways, having an oil and gas friendly person in the Interior Department is more important to the oil and gas industry than having someone friendly at the Energy Department,"" one industry official said. Nominating Lucas would also break with the long-standing tradition of Interior secretaries coming from Western states. It would also likely draw rebukes from animal rights groups. Lucas, who owns a ranch and serves on Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “anti-conservation zealots.” Donald Trump Jr., an avid hunter, has also publicly expressed interest in the job. Earlier this year, Lucas financed and produced a feature film called “The Dog Lover,” which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as being unfairly targeted by animal rights groups. The movie was backed by Protect the Harvest, a nonprofit founded and chaired by Lucas, that says it’s “Keeping America Free, Fed & Fun!” In 2014, Lucas gave $250,000 to the Protect the Harvest PAC, records show. Roger Ebert's website called the movie “shamelessly manipulative” and “a pretty bald piece of anti-[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] and/or PETA propaganda,” noting that the movie ends with a call to moviegoers to look into animal welfare groups before donating to them. Animal rights supporters were quick to point out Monday that Lucas had put up hundreds of thousands of dollars into fighting an ""anti-puppy mill"" ballot measure in Missouri that was approved by voters in 2010. ""Forrest Lucas is a peevish advocate of trophy hunting, puppy mills and big agribusiness, and has never met a case of animal exploitation he wouldn’t defend,"" said Michael Markarian, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, which backed the measure in Missouri. Lucas’ wife, Charlotte, who co-founded Lucas Oil, came under fire in 2014 for a Facebook post that criticized Muslims and atheists. ""I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!” she wrote, according to news reports at the time. She later apologized. Lucas has donated more than $150,000 to a slew of Republican candidates and causes since 2006, but records do not show any donations to Trump. In an interview last year, Lucas did not sound particularly enthused about the New York City real estate mogul. Asked if he would be comfortable with Trump getting the GOP nomination, Lucas responded: “It would be like when Obama got elected. I’d say, ‘I don’t really like it, but I have no choice and I’ll have to make the best of it.’” A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Lucas could not immediately be reached and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Elana Schor contributed to this report.",1,0,0

That destabilization has seen European countries overwhelmed by record-breaking numbers of refugees moving across their borders, redefining the continent's political landscape and heightening the threat of terrorist infiltrators. Terror threat Terrorism is already casting a particularly dark shadow over this meeting, as New York police investigate a Saturday bombing in Manhattan that injured 29 people. It occurred on the same day that a blast disrupted a Marine Corps charity run in New Jersey and a man stabbed nine people at a Minnesota mall. All three incidents are being investigated as possible terror attacks and security around UN events will likely be even more stringent than usual. Global leaders will hold special breakout sessions on refugees, Syria and Libya, where instability has also created openings for ISIS and other extremist groups. They'll address other priorities, too, including climate change, human rights, sustainable development and UN reform. Heightened tension On the sidelines, Obama will meet with world leaders. On Monday, he's set to discuss North Korea's nuclear tests and other Asian issues with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. On Wednesday, Obama will review a newly signed $38 billion aid package for Israel with its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discuss the prospects for Mideast peace. He'll also meet with leaders such as Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. Amid the week-long swirl of meetings at the iconic rectangular UN building bordering Manhattan's East River, there will also be the usual smaller dramas: the leaders who use their speeches to denounce rivals in impolitic ways and heated speculation about potentially fraught or historic meetings. Last year, a tense meeting between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin was swiftly followed by Moscow's intervention in Syria. This year, existing tensions will be heightened by a US strike on Syrian forces that the military had thought was an ISIS target, administration officials said. Russia called an emergency UN Security Council meeting, arguing that the Saturday strike showed the US isn't fully committed to cooperating with Moscow on the fight against militant groups including ISIS and warned that the Syrian ceasefire might break down as a result. ""We consider what happened as a natural result of the persistent refusal of the United States from the establishment of close cooperation with Russia in the fight against ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and other affiliated terrorist groups,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the architects of the nascent ceasefire, are expected to meet and may offer an update on its progress. The US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, expressed regret for the loss of life Saturday, but added that, ""Even by Russia's standards, tonight's stunt -- a stunt replete with moralism and grandstanding -- is uniquely cynical and hypocritical."" Iran question Since 2011, Power said, ""the Assad regime has been intentionally striking civilian targets with horrifying, predictable regularity."" The 2015 General Assembly also featured a historic handshake between Obama and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. This year, with the Iran nuclear deal under fire in Tehran and a tight US presidential campaign underway, political observers wonder if the two men will meet again. State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner couldn't say if even Kerry will meet officially with his Iranian counterparts, men he knows well from months of nuclear talks. ""We just don't have anything to confirm at this point,"" Toner said. Kerry also met Sunday with Asian allies to discuss North Korea and tensions in the South China Sea as a rising Beijing asserts itself in the region. Amid all this, the US will be focusing on ""three topline priorities,"" according to Bathsheba Crocker, the State Department's assistant secretary for international organizations, listing ""humanitarian response, peace and security, and countering terrorism and violent extremism."" Kerry will touch on humanitarian needs at a high-level Monday meeting on refugees. The next day, Obama hosts a Leaders Summit on Refugees. The US announced Wednesday that it will increase the number of refugees it absorbs from 85,000 this year to 110,000 in 2017. And on Friday, the administration said it would give $11 million to a UN fund that helps countries accepting refugees. Waves of people fleeing countries such as Syria, South Sudan and Afghanistan have overwhelmed the international refugee system. Unprecedented strains According to the UN, more than 21 million people are displaced today, half of them children, all of them in need of food, shelter, safety and livelihoods. They are placing unprecedented strains on their host countries, driving the rise of right-leaning anti-immigrant political parties in Europe and becoming a divisive US presidential campaign issue as well. In April, Republican candidate Donald Trump warned a crowd to ""lock your doors"" to stay safe from Syrian refugees, and in June added that ""a lot of those people are ISIS."" Crocker said Obama's leader summit on Tuesday aims to yield ""significant sustained commitments to UN humanitarian appeals, expanded refugee resettlement programs or alternative legal pathways for admission, and new opportunities for refugees and their host communities to benefit from improved refugee access to education and legal employment."" Tuesday will also mark Obama's final address to the UN as president. ",1,0,0
1047,"President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are holding what is expected to be their final meeting as heads of government on Wednesday—and there is every reason to expect that this one in New York, at the United Nations General Assembly, will be as fruitless as previous encounters. It is no secret that U.S.-Israel relations have become volatile and tense over the past eight years, with Obama and Netanyahu sparring over Israeli settlements and the all-but-moribund peace process, Iran’s nuclear program, and the uprisings of the Arab Spring. But the likelihood of a sputtering end to the Barack-and-Bibi relationship does lead one to ask: Which of the two candidates who are running to replace Obama next January—Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump—might do somewhat better in restoring the U.S.-Israel relationship and pushing for peace? Story Continued Below Trump surrogate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed at the Republican convention that Netanyahu and other government ministers favored Trump. Our sources say the Israeli security cabinet is divided but on the whole views Clinton as the safer course. There is, in any event, no doubt that the governing Likud Party has become closely aligned with Republicans in recent years, and that Netanyahu was betting on a Mitt Romney victory four years ago. “The notion that they don’t intervene in our politics and we don’t intervene in theirs is pure nonsense,” as Aaron David Miller, a Middle East negotiator for successive U.S. administrations, has put it. “Netanyahu has clearly made his preferences clear on the Republican side.” But Netanyahu is himself often second-guessed by Israel’s national security elites. And the answer to the question of who really would be better for a future U.S.-Israel alliance, a President Clinton or a President Trump, requires starting with a more basic issue: What does it mean to be a good ally to Israel? The current Israeli government seems to think that a good American ally would stop nagging Jerusalem about West Bank settlements, forget about the Israel-Palestine peace process, provide a blank check for security assistance, use military force in the region more readily, tear up the nuclear deal with Iran, and also supply weapons for Israel to strike Iran unilaterally if it thought it was necessary at some point. Hillary Clinton certainly would not follow this agenda to the letter; in that sense, her administration might well share some of Obama’s priorities. She clearly values the U.S.-Israel alliance highly, she is committed to Israel’s security, and she has credibly promised to fend off diplomatic efforts that Israelis see as “delegitimizing” the Jewish state whether at the U.N., through sanctions, boycotts or punitive disinvestment. At the same time, she has confirmed that the peace process and a two-state solution will be central to her Israel policies. And she promises to safeguard, not tear up, the nuclear deal with Iran. Safeguarding means holding Iran to its terms and being prepared, as Obama promised in spring 2012, to use military force if needed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Many Israelis derided Obama’s commitment—wrongly, in our view. But Clinton’s credibility regarding the use of force should not be in doubt. On balance, we think, she would be a better president in the long run for Israel. Here’s why. If Jerusalem hopes for an American president to renege on the nuclear deal, Trump may well be their man. He has certainly bragged about his history of walking away from agreements. What happens then, however, is a question for which Trump has no convincing answer. Some of his advisers point to Richard Nixon’s “madman” theory of how to frighten rivals with the unpredictability of American leadership. But Nixon, whatever his other faults, was a shrewd geo-strategist (and he had Henry Kissinger by his side). Trump, judging by his erratic and impulsive behavior on just about any given day of this campaign, seems far too close to the madman template for anyone’s comfort—least of all a small Middle Eastern state that depends on a steadiness of commitment from its American protector. Steadiness is one of the last words that come to mind when thinking about Trump’s various statements about Israel and the Palestinians. He could embrace something resembling neutrality and demand a return on U.S. assistance—signature Trump foreign policy themes—or, alternatively, as he put it, he could be ""the most pro-Israel president ever.” This uncertainty about his instincts does not bode well for alliance management. Indeed, his innate isolationism and nativist demagoguery portend two kinds of trouble for U.S. relations with Israel. First, Trump would enter office as the only genuinely isolationist president since the 19th century—an unsettling prospect for Israel, which depends heavily on U.S. internationalism (and an experience that Israel, which is only 68 years old, has never had). Although not, as a rule, philosophically inclined, Trump has expressed a coherent view of international relations as fiercely transactional and zero sum. This view extends to alliances, as he made clear in a New York Times interview in which he explicitly disavowed America’s Article 5 guarantee to defend NATO allies including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. “If we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries, and in many cases the countries I’m talking about are extremely rich … Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.”’ In the world according to Trump, alliances such as NATO are inherently bad arrangements for the United States because the country is defending European allies who have little capacity to reciprocate, and who are unwilling to adequately pay for their protection. Likewise, maintaining a nuclear umbrella over South Korea and Japan seems to be a foolish and dangerous entanglement when those countries could just as well develop and deploy nuclear weapons themselves. And, of course, ”isolationism” is a mild term for what Trump conceives as the proper relationship between the U.S. and its southern neighbor. Perhaps Trump will make an exception to his expectation of a “return on investment” for commitment to allies, and he will stand by Israel no matter what it can or cannot do for the U.S. in return. If so, however, it would be out of character. Second, Trump’s invective against Muslims and other immigrant communities might appear in sync with Israeli hard-liners—the GOP nominee has indeed pointed to Israel’s security barrier and security profiling of Muslims as models for his own Great Wall on the Mexican border and promised ban on Muslims entering the country. But if Israel’s government really prefers Trump on this basis, this will drive another wedge between Israel and American Jews. Most American Jews are politically liberal, and they are particularly allergic to fear-mongering rhetoric against minorities. The experience of millennia has taught them that security for diaspora communities depends on a general climate of liberal tolerance. When demagogues single out minorities, Jews have to ask themselves—are we next? So, to take a small but telling example, when Trump has said that “my Jews”—presumably his employees—used to say “Merry Christmas,” and implies that his presidency will usher in a new era in which “Happy Holidays” will be a euphemism of the past, American Jews are not amused. The fact is, the U.S.-Israel alliance needs to be nurtured for the long haul, which means facing up to its real problems and reinforcing its moral foundations. It is wrong to think that the problems between Obama and Netanyahu have been determined by the personalities of the two leaders. Generational transformation on both sides has deepened strategic differences over the best way to manage a fragile regional balance of power, Palestinian political aspirations, and the increasingly anarchic conditions in the region. Israel is becoming more religious and less democratic. The United States is becoming more diverse—this, after all, is what Trump’s followers are angry about—and, arguably, more liberal. Surveys of young Israeli Jews show a sharp decline in support of Israel’s identity as a democratic state, from 26.1 percent in 1998 to 14.3 percent today. The growing religious nationalist population is becoming increasingly powerful in Israeli politics and society, including the Israel Defense Force. In 1990, 2.5 percent of officer candidates self-identified as religious, compared with 26 percent in 2008. Young Americans, in contrast, are more liberal than their parents on matters related to Israel-Palestine. A recent Pew Survey indicated that 57 percent of self-styled “liberal Democrats” sympathized with Palestinians more than Israel—at a time when younger Democrats are more and more likely to call themselves liberal. Politics in both countries appear to be tracking these trends. Last May, Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon for defending a senior officer’s right to criticize the government. Rather than seek to shore up his coalition by replacing him with a center-left figure, Netanyahu opted for the far-right wing Avigdor Lieberman as defense minister, creating what Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea has called “the most radical government … in Israeli history.” Meanwhile, as Guiliani has contended, it may well be right that the Democratic Party’s leftward movement could bring additional tensions to relations with Israel. Bernie Sanders supporters on the Democratic Platform Committee failed in the effort to include language more harshly critical of the Israel occupation of the West Bank. There is little doubt, however, that this represented the views of many of his younger supporters. *** What can be done to revive the U.S.-Israel relationship, under either a President Clinton or President Trump? In our recent book on U.S.-Israel relations, we suggest that one approach would be to negotiate a formal alliance enshrined in a treaty that would specify mutual responsibilities. The U.S. would undertake a legally binding commitment to defend Israel from attack, particularly by Iran. Although the White House has already declared this commitment publicly, a solemn treaty obligation would inject it with greater credibility in Iranian as well as Israeli eyes. To underscore the depth of obligation, the U.S. could deploy a tripwire force—as it long did in the Asia and Europe—to ensure that Israel’s adversaries understood that an attack on Israel would be tantamount to one on Americans that would bring the United States into any military conflict. In return, Israel would agree to a final status accord with the Palestinians along the territorial lines that the U.S. has long endorsed: the 1967 borders with mutually agreed swaps. The U.S., working closely with Israel and Jordan, would not only help secure the parties’ safety, but work with European donors to put the new Palestinian state on a firm footing to reduce the possibility of revanchist violence. Under this arrangement, the U.S. would contemplate a military assistance package that came closer to Israel’s vision for the one that has just been signed, while Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank would ensure robust trade ties with Europe well into the future. Many on both sides will say that this program entails too many risks for too uncertain a gain. Israelis for whom past is prologue will argue that the practical benefits of a treaty is available at no cost. It certainly doesn’t fit with Donald Trump’s purely transactional view of international relations. But in an increasingly violent Middle East, it behooves both countries to reconsecrate a relationship based on a shared moral and strategic vision. As a matter of moral temperament and strategic vision, Hillary Clinton would appear far more likely to make this happen.",1,0,0
531,"Melbourne, Florida (CNN)Donald Trump declared himself the unquestionable winner of his first debate against Hillary Clinton during a rally Tuesday night, then relived the entire debate before a Florida crowd of supporters, this time with the help of a teleprompter -- and without Clinton baiting him. The Republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer Clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. He also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night. Trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as ""things of beauty."" He also again claimed to be ""holding back"" during the faceoff because he ""didn't want to do anything to embarrass"" Clinton. That comment came after blaming debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News for being tough on him earlier in the day, ""For 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""For 90 minutes, she argued against change, while I called for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change."" But while he spent much of the debate on the defense, Trump was free to unleash on Clinton without abandon as he rallied thousands of supporters Tuesday night in an airplane hangar. He slammed Clinton for having ""defended every major failure she helped create,"" placing particular emphasis on Clinton's track record as secretary of state. ""Iraq and Libya are in chaos,"" Trump said. ""Here in America we've seen one Islamic terror strike after another."" Trump pointed to Clinton's decades-old career in the political spotlight -- arguing she has not accomplished enough, and failed too often, in that time period. ""I kept saying for 26 years you've been doing nothing,"" Trump said. ""She's the candidate of yesterday. And ours is the campaign and we're the people of the future."" Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas and then the United States before she was elected for the first time to public office in 2000 as a US senator from New York. And while Clinton made it through the debate on Monday with relatively few attacks from Trump on the subject, on Tuesday, Trump attacked her over her email practices, including her false assertion she neither sent nor received information marked classified. ""Another Crooked Hillary lie,"" Trump said. ""Have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country?"" Clinton is ""an insider fighting only for her donors and insiders,"" Trump said, touting his outsider status. But Trump also entrenched himself on two issues the debate's moderator, Holt, called out on for being factually inaccurate. He insisted the stop-and-frisk practice used in New York City that a federal judge ruled unconstitutional in 2013 was constitutional. And he argued that he was ""against going into Iraq,"" even though he did not publicly oppose the war before it started, expressed support for it a month before Congress voted to approve military force and even praised the invasion as a ""tremendous success."" And earlier in the day, as the Clinton campaign sought to highlight disparaging comments Trump made about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, Trump reiterated his criticism. ""She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends."" Trump on Tuesday also returned to his characterization of the press as ""the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with"" and, as he continued to review the previous night's debate, suggested Clinton's success was tied to the ""mainstream media."" ""Without the mainstream media, folks, she wouldn't even be here. She wouldn't even have a chance,"" Trump said. But Trump also signaled that he and his campaign took note of his strongest moments in the debate. Trump hammered home his commitment to addressing trade imbalances Tuesday night and pointed to his back-and-forth with Clinton over trade, particularly when he called her out for calling the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements. Clinton now opposes the TPP trade deal. ""The American people rendered their verdict. The post-debate polls as I said to you were so great, but we exposed Hillary Clinton's real position on NAFTA which was by the way the single worst deal as you'll ever see and Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another great disaster that she lied about,"" Trump said.

746,"Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team? NBC News’ Lester Holt had his “Candy Crowley” moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by “fact-checking” Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War. Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators. Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question.  Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign’s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense). Here are the five worst examples. Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing — not asking — that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear. Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her “super-predator” remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to “white Americans” in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist. Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of “stop-and-frisk,” Holt interjected to bolster Clinton’s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over.  “A presidential look.” Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have “a presidential look.” He did so after noting that Clinton had become “the first woman” to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump’s past comments on women. Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote. Via: Breitbart ",0,0,1
329,"(CNN)Sen. Mark Kirk's campaign falsely asserted on its website that the Illinois Republican was a veteran of the Iraq war, a misstatement that comes six years after exaggerations over his military record nearly cost him his state's Senate seat. The Republican, now battling for a second term in a tight race in Illinois, stayed in the United States during the Iraq War when he served in the Navy Reserves. But on a public webpage on his official campaign website touting his record on veterans' issues, Kirk was listed as a ""veteran of the Iraq war."" While Kirk campaign officials said it was a staff error, the issue resembles the controversy that nearly caused his 2010 Senate campaign to implode. Moreover, Kirk is now running for reelection against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs during combat in Iraq. Kirk campaign officials said the webpage was not meant to be made public, saying that it was supposed to be a private site while edits were being made to the page. Campaign officials said a third-party vendor had drafted the language that they said had not been vetted or reviewed by the senator's staff. The language, they acknowledged, was inaccurate, saying it would be changed when the campaign began a more direct push to court military veterans. After CNN inquired about the statement, the campaign moved the webpage behind a password-protected firewall. It had been accessible publicly and through Google searches about Kirk's work on veterans issues prior to that. Kirk campaign manager Kevin Artl downplayed the error -- and instead attacked Duckworth over her tenure leading the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. ""Rather than focus on draft web copy that has yet to go through an approval process, we would welcome the media's attention on the six military veterans who died waiting for care during Tammy Duckworth's time at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs,"" Artl said. Duckworth campaign officials declined to comment. In 2010, Kirk came under heavy criticism for making a number of inaccurate comments about his military record, including falsely asserting he was the lone member of Congress to serve in Iraq and had been named the Navy's intelligence officer of the year. He later backtracked, including by saying he served ""during"" the Iraq war -- not ""in"" the war. He also later acknowledged that a different award was given by the Navy, and it was awarded to his entire unit. Kirk apologized for his misstatements, including one saying he had been fired on in 2000 while flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq and another saying he was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s. During the Iraq war invasion of 2003, Kirk was a congressman representing a district encompassing suburbs north of Chicago. He served in the Naval Reserves at that time but was working stateside, even joking to a reporter in 2003 that he wouldn't see combat unless the Iraqi army came to Washington. After a 23-year career in the Navy Reserves where he served as an intelligence officer, Kirk retired from the service in 2013 -- a year after he suffered a major stroke that still affects his mobility and speech today.

1056,"Democrats are starting to show cracks in their support for legislation that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia — suggesting White House opposition to the bill may be resonating with lawmakers preparing for the first veto override vote of Barack Obama’s presidency. But to sustain his expected veto, Obama will need to persuade 34 senators to change course and oppose the bill — a very difficult task. The legislation sailed through both chambers with no opposition. And the White House now has scant time to make its case to Capitol Hill, with a veto override vote in the Senate expected this month. Story Continued Below Still, there are glimmers of hope for the administration. Key lawmakers are now making it clear they remain undecided on overriding Obama’s presumed veto — a notable departure from the overwhelming show of support behind the legislation when it unanimously passed both chambers earlier this year. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, indicated this week that she was rethinking her support for the Saudi Arabia legislation amid renewed arguments against the measure from the Obama administration. “I do have some second thoughts with respect to that,” Feinstein said. “I think it could bring on a whole host of unintended consequences.” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Tuesday that “this is not a bill without complex ramifications” and he wanted to see Obama’s formal veto and his rationale for opposing the legislation before making up his mind on overriding it. “I think it would be incorrect for any member to think this is a very simple issue, that it may not have ramifications for the United States in other venues around the world,” Hoyer said. “Having said that, I will reiterate, I share and there is great sympathy among the Senate, the House, bipartisan, to assure that the American families who have suffered great grief and loss have an avenue to address their grievances.” But their public trepidation is going up against relentless lobbying from family members of the Sept. 11 victims, who have proved to be a powerful force. When Republican Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina began expressing their qualms with the legislation and suggesting that a veto override should be held off until the end of the year, the families fired back, saying the Republicans are asking “far more than the families and survivors should ever be asked to accept.” That ferocious push continued into Tuesday, as Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) met privately with 9/11 families in his office and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) held a news conference outside the Capitol with victims of the terrorist attacks. Another enemy working against the White House is simple: time. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday he plans to hold the override vote before senators leave Washington to campaign, dramatically cutting down the time the White House has to coax enough senators to sustain Obama’s expected rejection of the 9/11 legislation. McConnell said he assumed the veto will be overridden. The president has yet to formally issue a veto, but he is required to do so by Friday. Because the legislation originated from the Senate, that chamber will move first on an override. Speaking to reporters in New York, where Obama was attending the U.N. General Assembly, White House press secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged that the administration faces a “steep hill” in addressing their own concerns about the 9/11 bill. Yet Earnest suggested that more lawmakers are on their side than public comments would indicate. “As we’ve made this case, members of Congress in both parties have indicated that they are open to the concerns that we’ve expressed. In many cases, they share them,” Earnest said. “And the real question for members of Congress will be whether or not they’re prepared to cast a vote that is consistent with the views and feelings that they expressed in private.” The White House has repeatedly listed several concerns with the measure, including its view that the 9/11 bill could open up U.S. officials to legal retaliation in foreign courts. Earnest has also argued that the legislation could lead to different judges in different courtrooms coming up with varying terror designations about the same country. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he still had not decided whether he would support overriding Obama’s presumed veto. “I certainly agree with the premise” of the bill, Durbin said. But “some colleagues, in this case Graham and Corker have raised questions about whether or not there ought to be some modifications. I’ve talked with Sen. [Chuck] Schumer, there already have been modifications made.” The legislation, formally known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act to prevent countries involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil from invoking sovereign immunity, a legal principle that shields foreign nations from legal action. That would pave the way for 9/11 families to pursue lawsuits related to the attacks. It’s not a new measure in Capitol Hill; it cleared the Senate last Congress and then resurfaced in the chamber earlier this year. This time, proponents of the legislation note that changes have already been made to the legislation to accommodate concerns from the Obama administration, and in their view, there’s little room left for a compromise. Still, other influential Democrats show signs of taking pause. “I certainly don’t want to shield those who are supporting terrorism,” said Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. “On the other hand, I understand the importance of sovereign immunity as it relates to international activities. So I’d like to understand the president’s concerns, whether there are alternative ways to handle this before I make a judgment.” Late Tuesday, Graham said he has been in touch with the White House and Saudi officials but said he was pessimistic on any prospects to come up with revisions to satisfy both the victims’ families, as well as ease the Obama administration’s diplomatic concerns. “It’s either/or politics now,” Graham said. “You’re either for 9/11 families or you’re for Saudi Arabia. It shouldn’t be that way.” Other key Republicans also stressed they were also undecided. “I’m willing to hear [the White House’s] concerns,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, which crafted the bill. The two top senators on the Judiciary Committee — Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Patrick Leahy of Vermont — both said they firmly backed the legislation, which emerged from their committee earlier this year before passing the full Senate in May. “It should be 100-0, but I don’t expect that it will be,” Grassley said of a vote to override a veto of the 9/11 bill. “If people don’t want to override the veto, they should’ve expressed their opposition earlier.” Sarah Wheaton contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1183,"President Barack Obama wants Hillary Clinton to “be yourself and explain what motivates you” when she takes the stage Monday night for her first presidential debate. Obama offered the advice during an interview on ABC with “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts from the soon-to-open National Museum of African-American History and Culture on the National Mall. The two spent the bulk of their interview discussing the museum and what lessons it might offer for protesters in Charlotte who have at times become violent.

1474,"Obama has known from the very beginning that there are terrorists among the unvetted refugees he is bringing in. That was a certainty. He just doesn’t care. When he first said he wanted to bring in 10,000 refugees, I laughed. I told people he was planning on 250,000 and people laughed at me. Now he says 110,000 and I’m telling you, it will be way more than that and many of them will be ISIS connected. Obama is not only terraforming the US into a Muslim nation, he is deliberately bringing terror and chaos to our streets to destroy us. Just as he has done with race wars. It’s been the plan all along. Now they have the chutzpah to actually admit they know it, but they are still defending their actions. They have no intention of slowing down, much less stopping the influx. This is one of those areas that I agree with Donald Trump on… this must be stopped until we can adequately vet these people. Obama now knows that Hillary could lose, so he is doubling down on this and violence and death will follow.  From the Daily Caller: Islamic State terrorists have tried to pose as refugees in order to gain admittance to the U.S., Department of State spokesman John Kirby admitted Wednesday. “I wouldn’t debate the fact that there’s the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves,” Kirby said on Fox News. “And we’ve seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey, where they try to insert themselves into the population.” He was defending President Barack Obama’s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees in the next year, a huge increase from the 70,000 the U.S. typically admits, saying the vetting process is “good.” Any sane leader after having their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks, many of which are directly traceable to refugees, would back off and consider their actions and the consequences. But not Obama. We got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the UN and went all out for bringing in far more refugees. Obama hates America and he is a traitor to this country. Every action he has taken while in office screams that he is an enemy within. Yet, we are doing virtually nothing to stop him. Terrorism and dead Americans are the result of our apathy and complacency. Obama and his administration admit that this will end in terrorism. We know it will too. Why are we just letting this happen? Has America lost her will to fight and survive?  ",0,0,1
1182,"If not for the presidency, Bobby Knight is pushing Donald Trump for sainthood. “I actually enjoyed the day with Saint Donald and I've enjoyed watching him. I've really enjoyed watching him, I think go about things the way that he thought things should be.,” the legendary basketball coach said Friday on “Fox & Friends,” echoing a sobriquet he has begun using for the Republican nominee in recent days. “I think the man has a lot of really, really good things to bring to the table.” Story Continued Below Remarking upon Trump’s transformation as a presidential candidate, the famously hot-headed Hall of Fame coach said he was not sure if he would say the boastful businessman has become “milder.” “But I just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and go about attacking things and what's wrong,” Knight said. “I've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way.” Asked whether he had discussed the ongoing unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed an African-American man, Knight replied, “Not really.” “I mean that's -- you know, what is there to say?” he remarked. “It was wrong. It was—You know, you could go forever. That was not something that we really directed our attention to.” As far as what the two did discuss, Knight made note of Trump’s business records and ability to solve problems. “And that's what I think is the most important thing he brings to this job. The guy is going -- hey, this isn't working, we got to figure out what's wrong with this and we got to get this straightened out,” Knight said. “That, to me, is what being president is all about, and I don't think -- has there ever been a president that hasn't had problems?” The best president at that “might have been Reagan,” Knight said, adding, “that’s what Donald Trump brings to the table.” When it comes to Hillary Clinton’s assertion that Trump lacks the temperament to be commander in chief, Knight invoked his favorite presidents to argue the opposite. “Well, I think that being pretty strong willed is a pretty good asset to have,” he added. “I mean, who had -- has there ever been a president that was better than Harry Truman and Harry Truman had a damn good temperament.”",1,0,0
1000,"There’s one state where Donald Trump’s ground game appears to be a model of efficiency, rather than a ramshackle operation lacking organizers and field offices: Israel. As part of an effort to target what the Israeli chapter of Republicans Overseas says are as many as 300,000 U.S. citizens living there — many of them registered in places ranging from safe Democratic states like New York, New Jersey and California to swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania — the pro-Trump group is employing all the traditional tools long eschewed by the campaign itself. Story Continued Below In some ways, the Trump organizing efforts are more extensive in the West Bank than in West Palm Beach, Fla. While the Trump campaign and its allies spent much of the summer waving off the importance of brick-and-mortar offices in the U.S., the Israeli team is expanding its physical footprint. So far, there are five offices open in areas around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. And the group has plans to open three more offices starting as soon as this week: In Gush Etzion, which is also in the West Bank, near Jerusalem; and two others around Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. There’s even coalition-specific engagement—a top adviser to the Chief Rabbi of Israel is focused on courting the ultra-Orthodox vote for Trump, according to the campaign manager for the Israel effort. Compare that to the Trump campaign in Florida, for example, where there is little evidence of tailored Jewish outreach at all, much less constituency-focused outreach to various Jewish subgroups. Marc Zell, who heads up Republicans Overseas Israel, said they are “closely coordinated” with both the RNC and the Trump campaign on messaging. But the Israeli-based Trump effort is supported by local fundraising, not the GOP nominee’s campaign or the RNC. A Marco Rubio backer in the GOP primary, Zell tried to resign his GOP leadership position after Trump won, he said, initially distraught over Trump’s nomination. But Zell has since come to support the Republican nominee, heartened by the strong pro-Israel language included in the platform passed at Trump’s convention. Many Israelis who whole-heartedly embrace Trump appreciate his tough talk on terrorism and the fact that he represents a clear break with the Obama administration, which has had a tumultuous relationship with conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One poll of Israelis from June, however, found that 42 percent of Israeli citizens overall would vote for Hillary Clinton if they were American citizens, and 35 percent would back Trump. Other organizations estimate that there are only around 200,000 U.S. citizens in Israel. But whatever the number, the pro-Trump forces are targeting a group that includes many Orthodox Jews, who tend to be more conservative — and more likely to vote for Trump. “People, they…come back from work, they’re going to get help through the registration process from our specialists,” said Tzvika Brot, a former Israeli journalist who is campaign manager of the Israel effort. “Every evening, we’ll come to that office or some base in the houses of our volunteers. We even appoint area captains for each area in Israel.” To American political operatives who have worked with the Jewish community stateside, the intensive Israeli efforts to target U.S. citizens on Trump’s behalf underscore how little the Republican is doing to court Jewish voters in key American swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and especially Florida. “Instead of focusing on expats who are Floridians who live in Ashdod [in Israel], I would focus on Jewish Americans who live in Boca Raton,” said Michael Fragin, a consultant who worked on Jewish outreach for the Republican National Committee in Florida in 2004, and remains plugged in to the Jewish political world. In the U.S., he continued, “Nobody I know is aware of anything going on specific to Jewish outreach.” Added Lisa Spies, who ran Jewish outreach for Mitt Romney and remains heavily involved on the pro-Israel donor landscape: “With Trump, yes, there are pro-Israel Republicans listed on invites, or that go to events, but what they still haven’t done, and every campaign before has done, and Hillary is doing, is have a concerted Jewish outreach.” While the Jewish vote in the U.S. is traditionally heavily Democratic, there have been major efforts in recent years to convert more Jewish voters to the GOP. In 2012, Romney surrogates like former Sen. Norm Coleman hit the synagogue circuit for Romney and billboards reading “Obama…Oy vey!” littered South Florida roads. Romney personally visited Israel. And four years earlier, former Sen. Joe Lieberman was a top surrogate for John McCain. For several election cycles, Florida Republicans have targeted Orthodox Jews, Israeli-American Jews and Jews from South America, some of whom tend to be more conservative than their generally liberal co-religionists. And Jewish Republicans could claim some success in 2012: President Barack Obama won 69 percent of the Jewish vote in 2012 — down from 78 percent in 2008. But Trump, who has had to spend time swatting down accusations of racism and anti-Semitism following support from bigoted backers like former Ku Klux Klan head David Duke, already has built-in challenges with the community. And his lack of campaign infrastructure and outreach doesn’t help either, some Jewish political operatives say. It’s a missed opportunity, they add, especially in Florida, a battleground state crucial to Trump’s path to victory, where five percent of the electorate is Jewish and presidential elections are routinely close. “Who are their surrogates doing rallies, getting out the vote, speaking to this specific group?” Spies asked. “There doesn’t seem to be an actual effort.” Aaron Keyak, the co-founder of the firm Bluelight Strategies and a former top executive at the National Jewish Democratic Council who worked to counter Republican Jewish outreach in 2012, said he was surprised at the barebones effort in the U.S. this year. “’Incompetence’ was never a word that came up when it came to [Republican] Jewish voter outreach in 2012,” he said. “You don’t even know where to start now.” This time around, Coleman refuses to back Trump, Lieberman is supporting Hillary Clinton — and doing pro-Israel events with moderates and Republicans on her behalf — and Jewish supporters and detractors of Trump both agree there has been virtually no Jewish-focused outreach from his campaign in Florida, something the campaign itself acknowledges. “We welcome and include everybody, so I would say our approach is more general,” said Susie Wiles, who this month took over Trump’s Florida campaign, an operation that until recently had almost no field offices at all. “Our approach is also more aggressive, our outreach, our voter contact is unprecedented, that includes everybody in Florida.” She didn’t deny the absence of a specific Jewish voter outreach plan in Florida. “I would say that’s not wrong,” she said. But the lack of concerted Jewish outreach effort from the campaign itself doesn’t bother some of Trump’s Jewish supporters in Florida, who think the campaign is wise to focus on more sizable, less liberal-leaning constituencies. “Those of us who are Republican Jews are plenty outspoken about the sell-out of Israel by liberal Jews, but there’s no part of us that thinks we’re going to change their minds,” said Sid Dinerstein, a former chair of the Palm Beach County GOP. “There are bigger fish to fry.” The Clinton campaign doesn’t see it that way. They have both a director of Jewish outreach and a Florida-specific Jewish vote coordinator, as well as operatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania who focus on the Jewish vote. They conduct “bubbe banking” — using the Yiddish term for “grandmother” to describe programs through which Jewish senior citizens call their grandchildren and urge them to vote for Hillary Clinton. They’re also encouraging rabbi-to-rabbi phone banking. There are Jewish Women for Hillary events across the swing states, and weekly calls with rabbis and community leaders. The campaign has plans for more surrogates to hit swing-state synagogues, and they are highlighting centrist validators like Lieberman, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and billionaire Seth Klarman, a major donor to Jewish causes and to Republicans. That’s part of an outreach effort to moderates and Republicans who care about a muscular foreign policy and strong support for Israel. Jews for Progress, a super PAC chaired by former Congressman Ron Klein — who lives in Boca Raton, Fla. — is also planning to advocate on Clinton’s behalf in swing state Jewish communities, with the goal of raising a sum in the seven figures, Klein said, to fund that effort. While there are Clinton volunteers in Israel as part of activities run by Democrats Abroad, their efforts don’t appear as extensive as those from Republicans Overseas Israel. Asked whether there was a similar Democratic effort, Israeli operative Nimrod Dweck replied, “No! No. There’s no reason. Three hundred thousand people, that’s like a small town.” Dweck, who works on center-left issues in Israel and has partnered with 270 Strategies, a consulting firm whose founders played key roles on Obama’s campaigns, continued, “If you want to work on your effort, go to key states in the U.S. Do get-out-the-vote in the United States.”",1,0,0
906,"This Friday, the Trump camp released a new list of ten more potential judges that he would consider to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. This list includes a former law clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, Senator Mike Lee (R-UT). Lee believes that federal child labor laws, Medicare and Social Security are all unconstitutional and is arguably the most conservative member of the United States Senate. The list gave us new reasons to fear the Presidential candidate, by giving us insight into the legislative agenda the Donald will push if elected president. The list was tailored to appease hard line conservatives and skeptics, containing candidates from the whole spectrum of the right, from judges who believe the less the judicial branch intervenes the better, to those that want to get rid of the minimum wage and fundamental labor legislation guaranteeing basic protections. Mike Lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. “Right now I’m focused on my job in the Senate, where I’m in a good position to defend the Constitution by fighting against government overreach. Both lists that I’ve seen from the Trump campaign are fantastic.” In 2010 Senator Mike Lee described his interpretation of the Constitution in detail in a since-deleted YouTube video. In a segment of the video, Lee calls attention to the “toughness” of the decision in Hammer v. Dagenhardt, which challenged a federal law abolishing child labor by asserting child labor laws ought to be within the power of the state instead of federal jurisdiction. Congress decided it wanted to prohibit [child labor], so it passed a law — no more child labor. The Supreme Court heard a challenge to that and the Supreme Court decided a case in 1918 called Hammer v. Dagenhardt. In that case, the Supreme Court acknowledged something very interesting — that, as reprehensible as child labor is, and as much as it ought to be abandoned — that’s something that has to be done by state legislators, not by Members of Congress. […] This may sound harsh, but it was designed to be that way. It was designed to be a little bit harsh. Lee uses this separation of powers argument as his defense for a number of other “tough,” radical right ideas about peeling back federal powers. That’s because Lee is part of a movement whose members are convinced New Deal-era reformers plotted to “illegally” exploit Depression-born desperation and expand the federal government’s powers. People within this movement interpret the 10th Amendment of the Constitution as explicitly prohibiting spending programs and regulations disfavored by conservatives. Programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act are illegal in the eyes of people like Mike Lee, borrowing ideologically from the John Birch Society and the Libertarian Party platform of 1980, which demanded that we live in a completely darwinistic, plutocratic, and privatized world where there is no taxation, no safety nets of any kind, and political strings are entirely pulled by the purse, with zero checks on the marginal power of capital. The prospect of appointing someone like Mike Lee to the Supreme Court is terrifying because his agenda is to unleash unlimited spending in political elections to opportunistically help himself, while helping corporate stooges repeal every major piece of legislation that has resulted in gains for the poor, the homeless, the sick, the middle class, and the most disenfranchised in America’s marginalized communities.",0,1,0
907,"Congressional leaders and intelligence officials are investigating whether one of Donald Trump’s foreign policy “advisers” has opened up private communications with high-level members of the Russian government, some of whom are under sanction. According to multiple sources the talks have discussed the possibility that a Trump administration would lift the economic sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its unilateral annexation of Crimea in 2014, an international crime that Trump has refused to even acknowledge. The Trump adviser, Carter Page, is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York-based consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, that specializes in oil and gas deals with Russia and is located around the block from Trump’s office in New York. Page was first identified by Mr. Trump in March as a member of his “foreign policy team,” which is a motley crew of neoconservative oil men, Lebanese fascists, and imperial proconsuls from Iraq. He has since become one of Trump’s most prominent foreign policy spokesmen, although the campaign maintains that he is not officially on the bankroll. Page has extensive financial interests in Russia, notably in Gazprom, the state-run oil and gas giant, and Rosneft, the nation’s leading private oil company. He has frequently visited Moscow for meetings with high-level officials at the Kremlin and in Rosneft, and has been “a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did” according to a U.S. diplomat in Russia. Under particular scrutiny is Page’s trip to Moscow this July, when he met with Igor Sechin, a long-time Putin adviser and former deputy Prime Minister who is now the head of Rosneft and is currently under sanction by the United States government. According to numerous US officials in Moscow, Page discussed with Sechin ways to lift the American sanctions, a cause that is close to Page’s heart – and his wallet. Last March he told Bloomberg News that “so many people I work with have been adversely affected by the sanctions policy” and said that there was “a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.” On that summer trip Page reportedly also met with Igor Devykin, the Kremlin’s deputy chief of internal policy who is believed by U.S. officials to be the official responsible for Russia’s campaign of meddling in the American election. Indeed the original impetus for investigating Page came from the Congressional investigation into Russia’s cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and on voter databases in Arizona and Illinois. While the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees have “concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election” that “could only come from senior levels of the Russian government,” Trump’s usual chauvinistic bravado has been totally absent in the face of this unprecedented meddling in American democracy by a foreign power. Indeed he has denied that Russia was even responsible. Trump’s evasiveness on the issue is part of a long pattern of scandalous pandering to the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, from calling him a “better leader” than President Obama to promising to hand over the Baltic States to the Kremlin and going on Russian state TV to criticize American foreign policy. Trump’s traitorous appeasement of Putin, and the shocking monetary ties between his campaign and the inner circle of Russian oligarchs have already received some scrutiny – albeit far less than they should – in the American press. In Carter Page’s Moscow meetings, however, we may finally have the smoking gun implicating Trump’s campaign – or at least those close to him – in a traitorous plot with the despotic Russian government. The bombshell revelations that show Trump has received “hundreds of millions” of dollars from Russian oligarchs makes it clear why both sides would be interested in repealing the sanctions. Could Russia be plotting with Trump’s associates to influence the election in favor of the Donald, placing a Kremlin lackey in the White House who will lift sanctions in exchange for an economic windfall for his neoconservative cronies? Why else would his top foreign policy adviser promise a blacklisted Kremlin official to do what he can to end the sanctions and meet with the Russian intelligence official specifically tasked with influencing the American election?",0,1,0
1377,"Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one. I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.  From Gateway Pundit: At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door. The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed. The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic. Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point. Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.

It's one of the most anticipated political events of the year, and if you plan on watching it, here's what you need to know. 5 things to watch at Monday night's Clinton-Trump debate The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan organization that manages the events, will host the first of three general election presidential debates at Hofstra University in New York on Monday, September 26. CNN will air the event in its entirety on its networks as well as through a live stream on CNN.com. CNN Politics will host a live blog offering instant analysis and reaction as the debate unfolds at the top of the screen. Pence set to attend first presidential debate The debate is due to begin at 9:00 p.m. ET and is scheduled to last 90 minutes, without commercials. If you haven't gotten your fill from that, there will be a vice presidential debate on October 4 and two more presidential debates on October 9 and October 19, with the former hosted by CNN's Anderson Cooper. The commission said this first debate will have six time segments for about 15 minutes each. NBC's Lester Holt will act as moderator and open the segments with a question, then Clinton and Trump will have two minutes each to respond. After their initial answers, they can respond to each other for the remainder of the segment. Hillary Clinton prepares for unpredictable Donald Trump at debate Holt announced the topics he would draw from a week ahead of the debate. They are: ""America's direction,"" ""achieving prosperity"" and ""securing America"" -- three ambiguous terms pointing to a focus on the economy and security. ",1,0,0
862,"Social Security has been called the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you die. And if that is indeed the case, then Donald Trump might want to start picking out a nice casket. Bloomberg is reporting that when the GOP nominee met with Paul Ryan on May 12, he told the House Speaker that he does indeed favor cutting Social Security, but he’s afraid to say so publicly because it would doom his chances in November. Bloomberg cites an unnamed source who was in the room when the meeting was held. According to the source, Trump told Ryan: “From a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And there’s no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ‘We’re going to cut your Social Security’ and the Democrat is saying, ‘We’re going to keep it and give you more.’ ” This is in stark contrast to what Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail. Trump has said time and time again that he would leave Social Security alone. Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, believes the real intent of Trump is the same as that of most Republicans: Drastically cutting benefits while pretending to support the program: “It is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it. “In his eyes the ‘moral’ thing to do is to steal people’s hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.”   As we have seen repeatedly during the 2016 campaign, Trump lies about everything, reverses his positions on issues by the hour, and often seems to be utterly lost when asked for specifics about various policy questions. The man is an idiot. He is also a danger to the very essence of American democracy. Featured Image Via Flickr available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License",0,1,0
126,"It’s no secret that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie would like to be part of a Trump administration, probably in the role of Attorney General. But he may have to do it from prison if prosecutors are able to prove what they alleged in court today. The New York Times reports that prosecutors in the “Bridgegate” trial of former Christie associates Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni said during opening statements on Monday morning that Christie was aware of what was going on as it was happening. Defense attorneys for Kelly and Baroni had also previously claimed that Christie was aware of the supposed “traffic study” that was taking place at the Fort Lee, New Jersey entrance to the George Washington Bridge, but this is the first time prosecutors have publicly agreed with them. Prosecutors said that Baroni and David Wildstein, both alleged conspirators in the case, had bragged to Christie about the chaos being created by the lane closings, and how they had created the bogus traffic study to mess with the mayor of Fort Lee, a Democrat who had balked at endorsing Christie’s re-election bid. But prosecutor Vikas Khanna, also told the jury that they should not wonder why “others” weren’t charged in the case. Christie has denied knowing about what Baroni and Wildstein allegedly did until months later. But Khanna told the jury that the governor was informed at a September 11 memorial service in 2013, three days after the lane closures started, while they were still going on: “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish mayor Sokolich during those few minutes they had alone with the Governor they bragged about the fact there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned.” Wildstein, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in the case last year, is now the government’s star witness. Attorneys for Baroni and Kelly described him as Christie’s puppet. Baroni’s attorney, Michael Baldassare, said, “When David Wildstein spoke governor Christie’s voice came out and everybody knew it.” There is still no evidence that Christie knew or approved of the scheme ahead of time. But if prosecutors can prove that the governor did indeed know what was happening while it was still going on, and did nothing to stop it, it could cause serious problems for his barely concealed aspirations to be a member of Trump’s cabinet. Of course, with any luck there won’t be a Trump cabinet for him to be a member of. Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images  Trump told us EXACTLY who he will favor as president.",0,1,0
133,"Wouldnât it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, thatâs exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by BotswanaÂ for a visit and decided to preach hate. Andersonâs roadÂ  Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a âroundaboutâ way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. âI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,â Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The countryâs Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) Â â and if youâve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech isÂ kind of his âthing.â The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a âprohibited immigrantâ: Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana â Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016  What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be âstoned to death.â Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesnât advocate violence, the victims were âdisgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.â Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesnât believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), âif it did then yes I would condone itâ because âthe Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.â In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the countryâs acceptance of âf*ggots,âÂ has called the Orlando massacre âgood newsâ because a bunch of âf*ggotsâ died (he later expanded on that by adding that âperfect Christiansâ would âbatheâ in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jennerâs heartÂ and even suggested executing every gay person in the world âto cure AIDS.â You can watch Anderson getting snaggedÂ by immigration officials below.

1346,"The Obama administration's latest attempt to pacify Syria through diplomacy is failing in spectacularly bloody fashion, raising serious doubts among officials, analysts and others about whether pursuing more talks is worth it. But there's at least one prominent group urging the administration not to give up on negotiations. Story Continued Below As Syrian and Russian forces laid waste to the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on Tuesday, nearly 60 House Democrats sent a letter to President Barack Obama calling on him to ""persevere in this diplomatic path."" ""There is simply no realistic alternative to a diplomatic and political resolution of the Syrian civil war that takes into account the interests of Syria's diverse communities as well as the interests of all nations in a peaceful, stable Middle East,"" states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO. The missive appears to try to counteract a growing sense in some corners that if the United States is serious about stopping the fighting it must put some military muscle behind its pleas to Russia, the top international patron of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The lead signatories were Reps. John Conyers, Seth Moulton and Tim Walz, all miiltary veterans. More than 50 U.S. officials have already called on Obama to use military strikes to weaken Assad and protect Syrian civilians. But Obama has given no indication he's open to entangling the U.S. military in another Middle East war. The Syrian conflict has lasted more than five years, attracting an array of groups including terrorist networks, and estimates of the dead range up to half a million. The Democratic president's diplomatic team, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, insists it will keep pursuing negotiations with the Russians despite the collapse this month of a short-lived cease-fire and extraordinary acrimony between Washington and Moscow at the U.N. Security Council. Kerry pointed out to reporters Monday that although the U.S. and Russia are not talking ""right now"" — presumably a reference to just a few days of silence — Russia and Syria were attacking rebel-held areas in Aleppo anyway. As a result, Kerry is unwilling to give Moscow and Damascus a permanent cold shoulder. ""We're still focused on a political solution,"" said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman. Kerry's diplomatic dependency has led to grumbling by Republicans. Just last week, GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Kerry ""intrepid but delusional."" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), who respectively chair the Senate and House foreign affairs committees, have raised doubts about the reliability of the Russians or the Syrians when it comes to talks. Corker said Friday he was “saddened for the people of Syria who are being murdered"" but that ""this was always to be the outcome of negotiations since Russia has known all along that there was nothing to back up empty words from the United States.” There are no notable GOP calls for the administration to send combat troops to Syria, but Royce and others have pushed Obama to impose sanctions on Russia for its aid to the Syrian dictator. ""There is no hope for diplomacy as long as Assad sees a military path to victory,"" Royce said in a statement to POLITICO on Tuesday. ""Imposing stiff sanctions on Assad’s war machine and its enablers will allow us to push for peace from a position of strength."" The House Democrats' letter came about with support from left-leaning groups including the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker organization, and Just Foreign Policy. The letter writers urge Obama to think beyond Syria when it comes to diplomacy, suggesting he look for peaceful ways to end the war in Yemen and to resolve the conflict between the Turkish government and Kurdish separatists.",1,0,0
1161,"Hillary Clinton offered her assistance to Charlotte officials Thursday following two days of protests and violence in the city, urging the community to ""come together to stop the violence."" According to a pool report readout of phone conversations between Clinton, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts and North Carolina Rep. Alma Adams, the Democratic nominee emphasized the importance of restoring ""the bonds of trust between police officers and the communities they serve."" Story Continued Below During the call, Clinton stressed that ""too many Black Americans have lost their lives and too many feel that their lives are disposable."" The former secretary of state made similar comments two days prior when she lamented the “horrible” shooting death of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Friday, adding that it is “just unbearable and needs to be intolerable."" The Democratic nominee also called for unity in a time of turbulence. ""They discussed the steps we must take to ensure that everyone is respected by the law, and everyone has respect for the law,"" according to the readout. ""There are good, honorable police officers serving their communities across our country, and we must all work together to mend the wounds that exist and build the America we want our children and grandchildren to grow up in,"" the readout adds. Mayor Roberts later praised Clinton's initiative in reaching out to local officials during an interview on CNN, quipping that the former secretary of state had visited the city so often during the campaign that ""it could almost be a second home to her."" ""She did lend her support to the city,"" Roberts said. ""She understands that big cities has challenges and she wanted me to know that if there's anything she could do to help, that she would be happy to do that."" Roberts said she was not aware plans by either Clinton or Trump's campaign to visit Charlotte in the coming days. Charlotte has seen two days of protests and violence following the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man who was pulled over by police officer Brentley Vinson Tuesday. Twelve officers were injured on the first night of protests Tuesday, while another disputed shooting Wednesday night left a protester in critical condition. That protester died Thursday. Forty four arrests have been made. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrocry called for a state of emergency in Charlotte late Wednesday as clashes between police officers and protesters escalated. ""These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,"" McCrory said on CNN shortly after making the announcement. ""We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,"" he added. ""That is not the American way.""",1,0,0
449,"Washington (CNN)Texas Sen. Ted Cruz concluded months of animosity between him and Donald Trump on Friday by saying he will vote for the GOP nominee. But between the party-line camaraderie that Friday brought and the ""bromance"" from the initial stretch of the election, the two bitterly battled it out for the nomination. Here are some of the more notable -- and inflammatory -- salvos the two exchanged while on the campaign trail. 'Lyin' Ted' The attack Trump most frequently deployed against Cruz was the nickname the real estate mogul turned politician used to describe his competition: ""Lyin' Ted."" Trump routinely dropped that moniker on Cruz. Candidates' spouses take the heat In an election season defined by vicious and often personal attacks, not even the candidates' wives were safe, evidenced by Trump's tweet about Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz. The March spat came after a Facebook advertisement targeted to Mormons showed an old photo of Trump's wife, Melania, posing nude. The ad, however, was produced by an anti-Trump super PAC, which had no known connection to the Cruz campaign. Trump, however, didn't see a difference. ""Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!"" Trump tweeted in March. As for Heidi's ""beans,"" Trump never spilled them, much less described what he was referring to. 'A sniveling coward' Cruz's irate response was predictable -- even if his choice of words was not. ""Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone,"" Cruz told reporters in Wisconsin, pointing his finger at the cameras for emphasis. Trump links Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald Heidi was not the only Cruz family member to be called out by Trump. ""(Ted Cruz's) father, you know, was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's, you know, being shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous,"" Trump said in an interview on ""Fox and Friends"" the day of the Indiana primary in May. ""I mean what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It's horrible."" No other news outlets corroborated the claim that Rafael Cruz knew of the John F. Kennedy assassin. 'A pathological liar' During a May press conference, Cruz's attacks against Trump hit a new level when he called Trump a ""pathological liar,"" ""utterly amoral,"" ""a narcissist at a level I don't this country's ever seen"" and ""a serial philanderer."" The strong rhetoric came after the accusations Trump made about Cruz's father and shortly before the crucial Indiana primary contest -- which Cruz lost, ending his candidacy. Cruz's lack of endorsement at the RNC Cruz showed the hard feelings hadn't subsided two months later at the Republican National Convention, when he blatantly undercut Trump with a lack of endorsement during his turn at the lectern. Cruz personally told Trump he would not be offering him an endorsement during his speech, instead encouraging voters to ""vote your conscience"" -- earning boos from an audience hoping for party unity. Trump didn't want Cruz's endorsement, anyway Asked about the snub, Trump said he didn't want it, anyway. ""If he gives it, I will not accept it,"" Trump said at a news conference at the end of the convention. A new Canadian prime minister? In January, Trump tweeted a fallback plan for Cruz in case his presidential dreams fell short, suggesting Cruz could be the Canadian prime minister, a jab at questions over Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his Canadian birthplace. 'Pathetic' Kasich and Cruz band together When Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- a pair Trump once called ""the leftovers"" as they were his last challengers in the primary fight -- made an attempt to divide the map to stop Trump, the mogul didn't mince words about his view of the maneuver. ""Actually I was happy, because it shows how weak they are, it shows how pathetic they are,"" Trump said. Trump accuses Cruz of stealing the Iowa caucuses After Cruz came out victorious during the Iowa caucuses, Trump accused Cruz of committing fraud and stealing the win. ""Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,"" Trump tweeted in February. ""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Trump also tweeted. The accusations came after Cruz sent out deceitful mailers that shared voter's caucus attendance records with their neighbors and warned them of ""VOTER VIOLATION."" ",1,0,0
796,"Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website. Sansaricq’s statement says: Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived. The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent. The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

565,"This may be the biggest endorsement that GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump has gotten since the primary season ended. His biggest weakness with voters has long been his perceived lack of experience on foreign policy, which has been exacerbated by the foreign policy establishment’s general embrace of Hillary Clinton. While Clinton likely plans to pursue many of Barack Obama’s failed policies abroad, she has generally toed the foreign policy line that the political establishment has been parroting for years. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has taken a different tack on issues dealing with Russia, China, the Middle East, and Latin America. These differences have made it difficult for him to find supporters in the foreign policy community that could help him reassure voters. That’s no longer a problem. Former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, who was appointed and served under President Bill Clinton, came out this week and announced that he would be joining the Trump campaign and advising Mr. Trump on foreign policy. Woolsey said that he could not support Clinton because of her unwillingness to sacrifice her own self-interests and to safeguard our secrets. “She demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and an inability to lead the agency she headed in such a way as to maintain its mission and security,” Woolsey said in a statement. “Based on the emails thus far released we know that Secretary Clinton also lacks the ability to lead her senior managers while complying with and maintaining the basic protocols designed to protect our government’s sensitive and classified information. Mr. Trump understands the magnitude of the threats we face and is holding his cards close to the vest.”  Later in an interview with CNN, Woolsey cited Trump’s ability to safeguard our secrets (better than Clinton has) and his budget plans as reasons for throwing his support to Mr. Trump. “He seems to be, more so than his opponent, in favor of a strong defense budget. We’ve got a lot of space to make up and problems that have been left in defense by the Obama administration.”  Woolsey’s endorsement and advice may go a long way to helping Trump close the foreign policy gap that he’s thus far encountered with Hillary Clinton. Also, now that Woolsey has joined the team, one wonders if other foreign policy experts will begin lining up with Trump as well. With the debates around the corner, the Trump team certainly seems to be getting their political affairs in order, which can’t be welcome news for the Clinton campaign.

911,"A ninety-six-year-old World War II veteran and longtime New Yorker contributor Roger Angell has voted in eighteen elections. As he prepares to vote in his nineteenth, he has published an op-ed in which he shares his wisdom and experience – and sends a dire warning to the American people. This man, who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation, including the prospect of nuclear Armageddon, believes that the election of Republican nominee Donald Trump would be a catastrophe on the same level: “My country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, or perhaps since 1943, when the Axis powers held most of Continental Europe, and Imperial Japan controlled the Pacific Rim, from the Aleutians to the Solomon Islands, with the outcome of that war still unknown. “ Angell acknowledges Trump’s long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart: military service and the lessons of the Second World War, the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought. “I stick at a different moment—the lighthearted comment he made when, in early August, an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his Purple Heart and Mr. Trump said, “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier.” Mr. Trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow (he had a chance but skimmed out, like so many others of his time) and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat? This is the dream of a nine-year-old boy, and it impugns the five hundred thousand young Americans who have died in combat in my lifetime, and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war. I take this personally, representing as I do the last sliver of the sixteen million Americans who served in the military in my war…I experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends, classmates, and companions of my youth, who remain young and fresh in memory. I have named them in previous pieces, along with some wounded survivors, like my friend Gardner, an infantry captain who landed at Normandy Beach and fought at Hürtgen Forest and Aachen and the Battle of the Bulge, was twice wounded…my late brother-in-law Neil, who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of Belfort Gap, and who hobbled with a cane all his life, and with two canes near the end. Every American of my generation can supply stories like these, and once learned and tried to forget that, worldwide, seventy million people died in our war. Far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict – or never learned them at all, as in Trump’s case. Trump is a selfish coward at his core; a draft-dodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young Americans who perished in the jungles of Vietnam, a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors, a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once they’ve served their purpose. Trump is uniquely ill-suited for the presidency, a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle – negatives that deeply disturb Mr. Angell. “Mr. Trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down, who cannot appear to pause or lose. He is a man who must win, stay on the attack, and who thinks, first and last, “How will I look?” This is central, and what comes after it, for me, at times, is concern for what it must be like for anyone who, facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this, finds only the narcissist’s mirror for reassurance.” On the other hand, Mr. Angell has glowing praise for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a woman who has spent her entire life in public service, who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the Presidency: I will cast my own vote for Hillary Clinton with alacrity and confidence. From the beginning, her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged. She is intelligent, strong, profoundly informed, and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching, restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality. Her well-established connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis. Ms. Clinton will make a strong and resolute President—at last, a female leader of our own—and, in the end, perhaps a unifying one. He saves his best criticism for the end, however, as he nervously ponders what a President Trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the White House: “If Donald Trump wins this election, his nights in the White House will very soon resemble those of President Obama.  A new day is arriving, and with it the latest rush of bad news—another police shooting out West, another suicide bomber in Yemen, and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the morning’s difficult events. He needs to respond, but the beginning of this President’s response is always reliably at hand: How will I look?” We absolutely cannot elect a President that will put his own public image above the needs of the American people.

1426,"It takes a lot of courage to tell the world that one of your family members has been radicalized to the point that (s)he is willing to injure and/or kill people. It takes courage because a lot of people would feel horrible “turning” on their family like that and would avoid doing it, believing that they could take care of it within their own home. So, to finally gather that strength and go to the American FBI with the information that your son is engaging in suspicious/potentially terroristic activity, and then to have the very people who are slated with the safety of the American people tell you that your child is not a danger as per their guidelines, has to be a HUGE relief. Until you flip on the news one day and figure out that they were DEAD wrong.  Terrorist suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami’s father, Mohammad Rahami, went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in August of 2014 with serious concerns about his son. He says that they investigated Ahmad for two months before coming to the conclusion that he is “clean.” Mohammad took them at their word and accepted their findings. And then, on an innocent day in September, Rahami flipped on the news like millions of other Americans and saw the name of a bombing suspect scroll across the screen; his son’s name. “Two years ago I go to the F.B.I. because my son was doing really bad, O.K.?” he said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s O.K., he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say O.K.” He added: “Now they say he is a terrorist. I say O.K.” After several weeks of interagency checks, interviews and database reviews, the FBI had determined that Ahmad did not pose a terroristic threat to America. Then, after being taken into custody, authorities found a blood-stained notebook with a bullet hole in it. In this notebook were writings about “killing the kuffar” and passages that appeared to be sympathetic to the jihadist cause. This, according to a LEO who wished to remain anonymous during the interview. In this notebook, which is believed to belong to Rahami, there were writings that celebrated lone wolf attacks on American soil, as well as former al Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki. Keep in mind this whole “my son is a terrorist” bit started with Ahmad stabbing his brother in the leg with a knife during an argument. Whatever his punishment is determined to be will be too good for him. ",0,0,1
1513,"Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in. This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.  From Louder with Crowder: Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. Take it away CNN…   “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.” I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda. These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down. It’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now. ",0,0,1
290,"White Plains, New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton's supporters in the Beehive State have launched Utah Mormons for Hillary, according to a release from the campaign, the latest attempt to court a group of people deeply skeptical of Donald Trump. Clinton's campaign has sought to draw a wedge between Mormons -- a religious group that makes up about 60% of Utah, according to some estimates -- and Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Some Mormon voters have grown concerned by Trump's candidacy, citing questions they have about his principles and comments he has made that hint at religious persecution. The goal, according to David Irvine, a former Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives and a member of the the organization, is to convince people within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to pick Clinton over Trump by touting the former secretary of state's values and commitment to religious liberty. Since its founding in 1830, Mormons have been persecuted and chased out of a number of areas they tried to settle. Members of the faith, after being expelled from Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, eventually settled in Utah in 1847. Irvine said in a statement that Trump is ""belittling and scapegoating people of other religious and ethnic minorities in the harshest language."" ""His disdain for them is equaled only by his disdain and crudity toward women,"" Irvine said. ""The most enduring pioneer value is charity in its broadest sense, and Utahns looking for those kinds of values"" should vote for Clinton. Last month, Clinton pitched Mormon voters in an op-ed published by the Deseret News, a paper owned by the church. Clinton nods to the church's history of persecution in her op-ed, noting that other Mormons have compared Trump's comments to ""when Missouri Gov. Lilburn Boggs singled out Mormons in his infamous extermination order of 1838"" and ""President Rutherford B. Hayes' attempt to limit Mormon immigration to America in 1879."" Shortly after the piece came out, Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top policy adviser, opened a campaign headquarters in Salt Late City. Clinton is not the only presidential candidate looking to undermine Trump in Utah. Evan McMullin, a former House Republican aide and a Mormon born in Provo, Utah, announced his plan to get on the ballot in Utah earlier this year, hoping to court members of the church away from Trump. McMullin's campaign stresses that he is plugged into the Mormon church's power structure, and in a close race in Utah, a strong McMullin showing could help put the state's six Electoral College votes into Clinton's column. Clinton's aides know that chances of winning Utah are long, but her outreach is more about forcing Trump to spend time and money to shore up support in a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

222,"A reporter for The Washington Post, David Fahrenthold, has uncovered another instance where GOP nominee Donald Trump has made some questionable tax-related choices. The investigation that Faherenthold launched into the Trump Foundation, along with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s personal finances, has unearthed the fact that Donald Trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. How? By having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. An excellent example is that the Trump Foundation took in payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” According to sources in the Trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is Richard Ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality TV star for services, he should pay the Trump Foundation instead. It makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that Donald Trump hasn’t even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the “donations” continue to pour in. One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s senior advisers, Boris Epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: ‘What Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely “suggest” that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.’ The irony is not lost on anyone that he’s basically saying it’s legal, and it is, despite the fact that anyone with half a mind deduce the shady implications. Marc Owens, Head of the Internal Revenue Service’s non-profit watchdog agency, hasn’t been very thorough in his monitoring of the Trump foundation and seems shocked by all of the information that Fahrenthold’s investigation has managed to uncover. Owens, said: ‘This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total.’ It’s pretty obvious to anyone that’s paying attention that the GOP nominee is probably violating the rules that were written to prevent this kind of blatant laundering of money when it comes to tax-exempt foundations. If Donald Trump were to be charged and found guilty of violating these laws the punishment would mean a monetary penalty, losing the tax-exempt status for his foundation, and even, perhaps, criminal charges being filed. When asked by journalist Sharyl Attkisson: ‘Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?’ Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded: ‘Well, I hope so… I mean, my lawyers do it.’ It’s kind of ironic that the Trump campaign would go after the Clinton Foundation when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s own Trump Foundation has such shady things going on. For shady example, his foundation has zero paid staff. The Trump Foundation has literally been laundering money under the guise of being a “charity” and the person profiting from it all is none-other-than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

1510,"What a racist asshat this president is. He just came out and spoke on the Charlotte riots and it was exactly what I expected… lame and in support of violent radicals. He says the majority of people protesting are doing it the right way, if you can believe it. Is the right way killing fellow protesters? Is the right way looting and burning? Is the right way killing police officers across the nation? What a reprehensible statement and by the way, the exact opposite of what he said over the Baltimore riots. You don’t see these people doing the ‘wrong thing’ every once in a while. It’s rampant and getting increasingly worse, which is exactly what Obama wants. He’s now pandering to the Black Lives Matter, New Black Panthers, Nation of Islam devotees for Hillary Clinton. If he seems to condone their barbaric actions, he might win their votes… or so his twisted logic goes.  From Breitbart: President Barack Obama dismissed the recent violence and destruction in Charlotte, North Carolina by rioters reacting to the shooting of an armed African-American man by an African-American police officer. “The overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way,” Obama said. “Every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way. Looting, breaking glass, those things are not going to advance the cause.” Obama made his comments during an interview with Good Morning America’s Robin Roberts at the brand new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. He argued that Americans should recognize that there was a real problem in the justice system that the protestors in Charlotte were reacting to. “I think it’s important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind,” he said. Obama didn’t condemn the violence or the murder at all. He didn’t support the police either. Big shocker there. He’s an absolute disgrace to the black community. He always has been. We were well on our way to being a colorblind society until Obama started dividing us. He’s a stone cold racist. It was a black cop who shot a black man there in North Carolina, but Obama managed to make it all about race in the end. Typical. He paid weak homage to being peaceful… but that is not what he means and he knows that is not what has and will happen in the streets of America. I guess the difference in North Carolina was that the area wasn’t ‘black’ enough and by wording things the way Obama did, he greenlighted further violence by Black Lives Matter and other radicals. But hey… vote for Hillary!  ",0,0,1
1520,"The wife of Keith Scott got the audio and some video of the police shooting her husband. You don’t actually see them shoot him, you just see the aftermath and her screaming at them. She kept saying he didn’t have a gun and that he was on meds for some mental impairment he had. Gee, did that cause him to wear a thigh holster and carry a gun? Regardless of her claiming he didn’t have one, you can plainly hear the officers telling him to put the gun down repeatedly. He got out of the car first with the gun and then got back in. The police were going to break the windows and he got out again with the gun drawn. That is when they shot him. You can clearly hear her at the end yelling at Keith not to do something. He evidently did it and it involved the gun, which got him a dirt nap. I’m sorry, I have no sympathy for any of this. He deliberately would not obey repeated commands by the police and that got him shot.  From Western Journalism: The wife of shooting victim Keith Scott was pleading with him not to do something in the final moments before his fatal encounter with police officers on Tuesday, according to a cellphone video recorded by Scott’s wife and shared by the family with The New York Times. Scott was killed Tuesday by Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., police after a confrontation in which police said Scott became aggressive and was a threat to the officers. Police reportedly have recovered a gun from the scene that had on it Scott’s fingerprints and DNA. The cellphone video was given to The Times by Scott family lawyer Justin Bamberg. Videos taken by police cameras have been termed by the police as inconclusive in documenting what took place just before police fatally shot Scott. I don’t understand his wife either. There’s nothing that could have kept me from my husband at that point. And I sure as hell would not be stopping to video all of it. He’s far more precious to me than whatever lawsuit this woman is angling for. The media of course is lapping this up and painting his wife and him as victims. Typical. Scott’s family, initially contended that he was carrying a book, but after viewing the police video on Thursday said it was “impossible to discern” what, if anything, he was carrying. They urged police to release the footage. “There’s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively, threatening or maybe dangerous,” said Justin Bamberg, one of the lawyers representing the family, said in an interview early on Friday. Well, you can’t see anything in the damned video, so I guess that is right. But you can hear the police telling him to drop the gun again and again. Despite law enforcement’s refusal to release any footage, Scott’s family gave a video recorded by his wife to NBC News. It aired on MSNBC less than an hour after authorities’ press conference ended. That was totally staged. I’ve lost all patience with this victim mentality that seems rampant out there… and I am beyond done with Black Lives Matter. The police can’t win for losing here.    ",0,0,1
1359,"NEW YORK — Wall Street rallied on Tuesday as investors appeared to cheer Hillary Clinton’s strong performance in the first presidential debate and rest a bit easier about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House. U.S. stock futures rose sharply immediately following the debate, which most pundits and surveys suggested the Democratic nominee won handily. The Mexican peso soared. The currency tends to drop as Trump’s chances rise, with investors betting on the GOP nominee making good on his promise of new trade tariffs. Stocks continued to climb during the day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 133 points, though some of that was in response to a very strong consumer confidence number. Story Continued Below Market analysts say positive reaction to the debate is not because Wall Street adores Clinton or her policies on taxes and spending. Instead it’s that many do not know what to expect from a Trump presidency and fear the impact of new protectionist trade policies and possibly unpredictable foreign relations. Wall Street’s biggest fear is uncertainty. “We’re seeing a bit of a ‘relief rally’ today. Equity markets are higher, and the peso, one key anti-Trump barometer, has rebounded from its multi-year low hit yesterday,” said Jack Ablin, chief market strategist at BMO Private Bank. “Investors assumed that Trump would cement a lead from the debate, but Hillary stayed on message, Donald did not.” Thus far in 2016, markets have not shown very strong reactions to the ebbs and flows of the campaign, as many investors assumed a Clinton win. Most of Wall Street focused on the Federal Reserve over the past several weeks, wondering whether it would raise interest rates at its September meeting. But with that meeting now past, and the Fed still on hold, investors and traders are paying closer attention to the 2016 race and taking the prospect of a Trump win more seriously, greeting news of his rise in the polls with bouts of selling. “There was certainly a reaction in the futures, and that was clearly related to the debate,” said Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management. “Traders clearly decided before the debate that a Trump win would be bad and a Clinton win would be good.” But Paulsen cautioned not to read too much into Tuesday’s market action. “Overall, there’s not much evidence of a big election impact on the markets, because there has been so much else going on with global growth, earnings and the Fed.” One area where a 2016 effect clearly shows up is in the currency markets, particularly the peso versus the U.S. dollar. The peso plunged 8 percent in the three weeks leading up to Monday night’s debate as Trump rose in the polls to a virtual deadlock with Clinton. After the debate, the peso rallied over 2 percent against the dollar, suggesting investors viewed Clinton as the winner. Trump continued his attack on Mexico as an unfair trading partner during the debate and once again ripped the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and the worst trade deal in history. “Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries,” Trump said at the outset of the debate. “The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons.” Trump also again threatened new taxes on Mexican imports, something that could lead to fewer exports from the country and thus a weaker economy and currency. Clinton, by contrast, is viewed by many on Wall Street as generally favorable toward trade — despite her avowed skepticism about the Trans-Pacific Partnership — and unlikely to unleash new protectionist policies. So when Clinton does well, markets tend to rise along with the peso. “Most people viewed Hillary as the winner of that debate, and markets clearly want Hillary to win rather than Trump; you can tell that from the way it trades,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “People are very concerned about Trump’s trade policies being bad for the economy, and then there is the crazy factor. He comes across as having an irresponsible attitude at times and thin skin that would make him more reactionary than a president would ordinarily be.” Massocca and others noted that while Wall Street does not look favorably on all of Clinton’s proposed tax increases — especially on the wealthy — she is a very well-known quantity, having been in public life for decades, including as a senator from New York. She has also raised millions of dollars from Wall Street and given highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banking groups. In addition, many big investors believe Clinton will likely be constrained by at least one side of Capitol Hill as president. That would mean more of the same kind of economic policies seen since divided government began after the 2010 midterm elections. “Somewhere along the way, everyone decided Clinton meant stability and Trump meant volatility and uncertainty,” said Paulsen. “And if it’s Clinton, there won’t be all that much she can do and it will be like Obama for the last six years.” Trump has also spooked some investors by referring to the current market as a “big, fat, ugly bubble” and suggesting it is going to burst in the near future. He has also taken the unusual step of publicly and repeatedly criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, something presidential candidates and presidents generally stay away from, given that the central bank is supposed to be largely insulated from the daily grind of partisan politics. The fear is that as president, Trump could be extraordinarily involved in monetary policy, possibly damaging both the economy and financial markets. Trump supporters argue that his presidency would actually be very good for stocks and the economy, with large tax cuts for corporations and individuals and a reduction in regulations that businesses often complain choke off stronger growth. He’s also pledged to bring back the more than $2 trillion in cash U.S. companies currently have overseas while spending hundreds of billions on infrastructure, all of which could be stimulative to the economy and good for stock prices. Trump tried to make that case in the debate on Monday night. “My tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan,” he said. “I’m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence,” he said to Clinton. “I’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They’re going to expand their companies. They’re going to do a tremendous job.”",1,0,0
94,"When Donald Trump was asked by debate moderator Lester Holt last night how he would prevent cyberattacks against the United States, the Republican nominee had an opportunity to hammer Hillary Clinton on her use of a private email server and her handling of classified information as secretary of state. Instead, Trump suggested that a 400-pound hacker could have targeted the Democratic National Committee, accused Democratic officials of mistreating Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign and praised his 10-year-old son’s “unbelievable” knack for computers.     The exchange was one of several missed opportunities for Trump in Monday’s presidential debate, according to congressional Republicans who tuned in to the much-anticipated matchup. “I wish Trump would’ve hit some of the softballs a little harder,” said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., who watched the debate with colleagues. Republicans expressed frustration that Holt did not ask any questions about the Clinton Foundation or the Benghazi attacks while challenging Trump on his record on the Iraq War and real estate career. But lawmakers said the New York businessman should have taken every opportunity to bring up those issues, which have dogged Clinton’s presidential campaign. “She might as well have emailed the Russians her email address!” Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., exclaimed Tuesday about Clinton’s use of a private email server. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found that just 36 percent of voters see Clinton as honest and trustworthy, compared with 45 percent for Trump. Trump, who has never run for public office, held limited debate practice and did not take part in any mock debates, according to campaign advisers, while Clinton was still preparing as late as Monday afternoon. Some top Republicans praised Trump for effectively making his case to American voters. “I saw Hillary Clinton give a polished, well-rehearsed defense of the status quo,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday. “I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo.” Trump, Ryan continued, showed “for 90 minutes he could go toe to toe with Hillary Clinton.” Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, said the debate “was very interesting.” While many Republicans gathered to watch the debate in Washington, it wasn’t required viewing for everyone. “I was on an airplane,” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told reporters. Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., who is in a tough re-election race in upstate New York, also declined to answer questions about the debate Tuesday.

One of the GOP candidateâs easiest lies to expose was his insistence that âstop and friskâÂ wasnât ruled unconstitutional. Heâs wrong, it absolutely was. Debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about his recent arguments in favor of âstop and friskâ and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. ââStop and friskâ was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men â â Trump cut Holt off mid-sentence:Â âNo, youâre wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.â Factcheck:Â U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled âstop and friskâ to be unconstitutionalÂ August 12, 2013.Â According to the Center for Constitutional Rights,Â âJudge Shira Scheindlin found the NYPDâs practices to violate New Yorkers âFourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,â The Bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. The order was then suspended by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the case was sent back to be tried againÂ with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. However, the court shot down the cityâs motion and decided not to vacateÂ Scheindlinâs decision. The appeal was eventually dropped byÂ the de Blasio administration. Trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by Holtâs assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice.

And while the political elites attempt to bring down Trump, they forget or attempt to distract the public, that they are the political class, and are directly responsible for America’s decline, and aside from the phony who currently resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, there’s another phony, in one Hillary Clinton, who has been a career politician for decades, and who now claims to be an outsider, regardless of the fact that she and Bill Clinton have amassed a huge fortune. Perhaps this 3-minute video clip best illustrates how these two career politicians have used the system to enrich themselves by creating perhaps the largest criminal enterprise within American politics, known as the “Clinton Foundation” which promotes itself as a worldwide outreach charitable organization, while at the same time a financial slush fund for these two. Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, sold access to anyone and everyone with an open checkbook, while Bill used her influence to enrich himself with blotted speaking fees to those same countries donating vast sums of money to the foundation, by selling America down the drain to the highest bidder.

On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conferenceÂ in Cleveland.Â Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mindÂ pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was workingÂ  the Prince of Darkness already.

And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it. (*Insert eye roll here.) Personally, I think they are a little late.

1532,"Alicia Garza, co-founder of BlackLivesMatter, has demanded that there should black communities without any cops. This ignorant statement of hers is turning heads throughout the whole country, but not for the reasons she wants.  In the wake of the latest spate of black men forcing cops to shoot them, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement says it’s time for the police to leave the black community. The idea apparently is that black neighborhoods, full of the worst criminals this country has to offer, would be safer without the protection of the police department. Alicia Garza co-founded Black Lives Matter on the lie of Trayvon Martin’s death and it came to national prominence on the lie of Michael Brown’s death. With a foundation built entirely out of bullshit, it’s no surprise that everything that comes out of the mouth of one of their founding mothers is completely asinine. Garza did an interview with Complexand it was one for the ages. In regards to the recent police shootings of black men in Tulsa, OK and Charlotte, NC, Garza hasn’t seen the videos, which support the police officers, but somehow she knows the cops were wrong. “I’ve chosen not to[watch the videos]. I think we know what it looks like when somebody is murdered, said Garza. Yeah, screw the facts. She doesn’t want them getting in the way of her preconceived notions and general hatred of law enforcement. Then there is this about the Charlotte riots, which erupted after a black cop shot and killed an armed black man: “The thing that people get so concerned about is how do we stop the violence in Charlotte, but yet we’re not thinking about the fact that there’s been violence in Charlotte since way before whatever is happening there has happened. The brother who was killed is a form of state violence. He was killed and the police will not release the video. The police are not taking accountability for the violence that they enact in our communities and yet there isn’t as much outrage about that as there is about some broken windows and lost property,” she said. A black protester shot and killed another random protester. Mobs of blacks have beaten the shit out of innocent white people because of the color of their skin. This is more than broken windows and lost property and it’s based on yet another lie. “How do we stop violence, looting, and riots? The way that we stop that is by making sure that people have the things that they need to thrive. When people are systematically denied their right to adequate housing, adequate schools, to adequate food, to dignity—this is a response and a reaction that we should absolutely expect,” Garza said. What a lot of people do to get adequate housing, schools, food, and dignity is work, you know, like at a job where they earn money to buy necessities. It works a lot better than looting for those things or hoping the government will give them to you. And finally Garza says the black community would be better off without any police at all: “Ultimately, policing in and of itself is problematic. I know that in this country we give a lot of veneration to police. In the ethos of this country, police can do no wrong. And if and when police do wrong, it’s a case of individual bad apples, as opposed to a corroded and corrupt system… Quite frankly, many of our [Black Lives Matter] members are continuing to investigate what it would mean to have police-free communities. I think what we’ve continued to see over time is that no moral appeal is actually stopping the deaths of black people, whether they be armed or unarmed,” said Garza. Interesting theory. She’s saying that cops kill blacks so getting them out of black neighborhoods will mean no blacks will ever be killed. This ignores the fact that almost all black people are killed by other blacks and that by removing cops from the equation there will be even more black killers running loose in the black community. But hey, good luck with that. Do these people realize what a cop free community would look like? It’s not all happy and bliss as they think it would be. It would make matters SO much worse. I can’t stress this enough; WE NEED POLICE. enchanted Sep 26, 2016 at 4:34 pm I will bet ten dollars she wouldn’t live in a cop free zone.",0,0,1
1300,"Donald Trump should skip the next two debates unless he gets special guarantees from the moderators, former New York mayor and top Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told reporters after the debate. Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor who moderated the debate, should be “ashamed of himself,” Giuliani said after the debate. He said Holt was wrong to attempt to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and his claimed opposition to the Iraq War. Story Continued Below “If I were Donald Trump I wouldn’t participate in another debate unless I was promised that the journalist would act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact checker,” Giuliani said. “The moderator would have to promise that there would be a moderator and not a fact checker and in two particular cases an enormously ignorant, completely misinformed fact checker.” “If you wonder why Donald Trump thinks that the press is a left-wing basically oriented group, Lester Holt proved it tonight,"" he added. He later clarified about future debates: “I didn’t say what I’m advising him, I said what I would do.” Trump himself had no problem with Holt's performance. The moderator did a ""fine"" job, Trump said. But Giuliani was especially piqued by Holt’s claim that “stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York.” “No, you're wrong. It went before a judge who was a very-against-police judge,” Trump responded. “It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.” “Stop and frisk is completely constitutional and the American people have been given the false impression that it isn’t,” Giuliani said. A federal district court judge ruled in 2013 that New York City’s stop-and-frisk policy violated the Constitution. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ran on a platform opposing stop-and-frisk, ended the policy soon after taking office.",1,0,0
1547,"The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.   Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.” DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.   Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too. Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents. How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? And if the answer to that question is “yes,” then the new question becomes… why? ",0,0,1
521,"Washington (CNN)Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a Senate hearing Tuesday that 18 states have taken up his agency's offer to help improve cyber security for their election systems, in the wake of suspected breaches blamed on Russian hackers. ""We are seeing a limited number of instances where there have been efforts through cyber intrusions to get into the online presence of various state election agencies. And, one or two of them have been successful, others have not,"" Johnson said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing. The issue of the integrity of US elections has been a prominent one on the presidential campaign trail, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Sen. Harry Reid each raising concerns about possible rigging of the results. Both Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, said at Monday's debate that they would respect the election results. Asked by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana, whether hackers are seeking to change votes, Johnson said: ""What we are seeing are efforts to get into voter registration rolls, the identity of registered voters, things of that nature, not to change a ballot count."" Johnson said the matter was still an active investigation and that the source of the intrusions hadn't been concluded. US officials briefed on the investigation have told CNN that an intrusion in an Illinois voter registration database and an attempted breach in Arizona are believed to be the work of hackers working for Russian spy agencies. US officials say there's strong evidence that Russian government hackers are behind a series other cyber-attacks against the Democratic National Committee and other affiliated political organizations. Johnson, FBI Director James Comey and Nick Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, on a variety issues during the hearing, ranging from the perceived missteps that failed to prevent recent domestic terrorist attacks to the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Lawmakers used the hearing to press Comey on the FBI's handling of suspects in recent domestic attacks, including those behind the Orlando mass shooting and the bombings in New York and New Jersey. The FBI had done preliminary investigations prior to the attacks on both suspects but closed the files on both men after not finding enough evidence to continue. ""I'm not here to say the FBI is terrible because it missed these things, but I'm also troubled that the FBI is unwilling to even admit they've made some mistakes,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said. Comey said the FBI will review the case of the alleged New York bomber Ahmad Rahami to see if anything was mishandled. ""We will go back and scrub our prior contact with that matter very, very carefully -- and maybe the inspector general will as well, which would be great as well -- and if there is learning, we will learn from it,"" he said. Republicans on the committee renewed their criticism of the FBI for recommending no charges be brought in the Clinton probe. Comey said the FBI didn't find evidence to bring charges for possible obstruction of justice. Comey spoke of the increased threat of domestic attacks as the US bombing campaign against ISIS prompts foreign fighters to return home. ""The so called (ISIS) caliphate will be crushed -- the challenge will be through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of very, very dangerous people,"" Comey said. ""They will not all die on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. There will be a terrorist diaspora sometime in the next two to five years like we have never seen before."" ",1,0,0

1403,"By now we’ve all heard the new reports of Pokemon GO players wandering around at night, getting their jollies off fictitiously catching fictitious monster animals. Alright, maybe ‘jollies’ is a little over the line and I am being inconsiderate to feelings…but this is the real world, not a made up one, and if you want to walk round at night with your eyes glued to your cell phone, not taking into consideration what or who is around you, then by all that is good and decent, you leave yourself open for an attack… NO! Not by Pokemon! By REAL people who want your cell phone, your wallet and anything else of value that they can find! …Think of it as a ‘Got to catch em all!’ for muggers… except you’re the Pokemon.  Well, in this case I’m going to share with you right now, Pokemon GO Twitch user Rickeybot was brutally socked in the face by a mugger who walked up behind him and robbed him. What makes this violent outbreak a perfect example to share with other GO players is that it was all caught live on the very stream Rickeybot was using Sunday in New York City’s Central Park. Judging by the background, it seemed as if the Grand Army Plaza, a designated Pokestop, was the site of the mugging, according to the map he was using at the time.   Rickeybot was keeping his fans up to date using Twitter, like most millennials do these days. Turns out the Twitch user was socked straight in the jaw, which he had scanned at the hospital. Amazingly, it was only swollen without major damage, although judging by the video, it would seem as if he smacked his head on the ground or something because of the blood seen on his forehead. So, what’s the lesson we learn from Rickeybot, hmmm? Well, I could say stop playing a child’s game and grow up, but I realize the world we live in and I would be considered a dreaded, villainous ‘hater’ by the lot of Pokemon GO adult children…so instead, I say play on, my Pokemon GO brothers and sisters!

Washington (CNN)Hopes by Donald Trump's campaign that it can mobilize enough white voters to win in November is a case of self-delusion, according to GOP pollster Whit Ayres. ""That's a wonderful example of how we can delude ourselves into thinking that nothing really has to change,"" Ayres recently told CNN's ""Party People"" podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham. The North Star Opinion Research political consultant pointed to an estimated 4.2 million white voters who participated in the 2008 elections but did not vote in 2012, when the GOP nominee lost by 5 million votes nationally. ""So if every single one of them had turned out and voted for Mitt Romney, he still would have lost. Moreover, most of those white voters who didn't turn out were in deep red states -- places like West Virginia and Arkansas and Oklahoma -- where the presidential campaign was never competitive and they saw no reason to go and vote."" ""You don't get bonus Electoral College points for that,"" Ham added. RELATED: 2016: Last call for working class whites? Ayres, who worked with Sens. Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham as well as Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, warned that Republicans are working with a ""worn-out business model.""

He suggested the party can broaden their electorate by targeting Hispanic voters, citing the last Republican president as a role model. ""George W.

672,"Huma Abedin dumped her then-husband Anthony Weiner when it was revealed that he had carried on a sexting relationship with another woman – one of many – in which he had sent a risqué picture of himself, and in the picture, he was accompanied by his young son. But unbeknownst to his then-wife and the rest of the world – but certainly not surprisingly – he was carrying on another relationship during this time with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. From January to July, he sent photos and vulgar texts to her. I’ll let the New York Post fill you in on the dirty details: The 15-year-old high school student went public with a trove of lurid come-ons she got from Weiner, who exchanged his “Carlos Danger” persona for the alias “T Dog” to send her kinky texts and shirtless selfies over a cell-phone messenger app. Weiner repeatedly told the unidentified teen how “hard” and horny he was, at one point boasting that after sex with him she would, “limp for a week,” the Daily Mail reported. Weiner — whose serial sexting cost him his seat in Congress and a comeback bid for mayor — also shared pornographic videos with her, asked her to get naked and masturbate for him over Skype, and even told her about “rape fantasies” that grossed her out. The girl said Weiner tried to cover up the sexual nature of their relationship by pressuring her to write a letter to her father and a teacher in whom she had confided, “and tell them what I said was false.” Even liberal Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo is disgusted with Weiner. “If the reports are true, it’s possibly criminal and it is sick,” he said. “And frankly, I’ve heard enough about Anthony Weiner, and I think that goes for all New Yorkers.” If Weiner is charged at the federal level with sexual exploitation of children, it carries with it a minimum of 15 years in prison, and a maximum of 30 years. At the state level, disseminating indecent material and promoting the sexual performance of a child could each get him 7 years in jail. In response, Weiner said that he has “likely been the subject of a hoax,” but as the Post pointed out, he didn’t deny any of the allegations against him. In a prepared statement, Weiner said, “I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement [sic] about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt…. I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position.

1443,"Brad Paisley doesn’t seem like one who would call out any other dude, but apparently he is! Brad Paisley is one of our favorite country artists, and he has more American pride than almost any other country artist. Although we were surprised at his latest statement, we kind of weren’t surprised at the same time. If you have any kind of social media, or you read the news anywhere you have probably heard about a man by the name of Colin Kaepernick. He is the San Fransisco 49ers quarterback and he refused to stand up during the National Anthem.  Of course, this caused a lot of controversy all over the U.S considering the fact that football is America’s sport. Kaepernick stated his reasoning behind sitting during the National Anthem and it only made American’s more mad…well most of them at least. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color…To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”  In response to his comment his team made a statement saying that it is an individuals choice to choose wether they stand for the anthem or not. “The national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.” This didn’t set well with Brad Paisley though, and he made sure that his fans knew he didn’t support Kaepernick’s decisions. The country star was recently performing at then PNC Music Pavilion in Charlotte and a video came up behind him that had fans rolling laughing.  Paisley was performing a fan favorite song “Celebrity” that talks about stars who let fame get to their heads. It’s a humorous song, but the best part was the video that was playing behind Paisley while he sand the song. The video was of making fun of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, and Donald Trump. The crowd was laughing hysterically but then a video of a cartoon Kaepernick was kneeling on the football field and other players were standing around him! The crowds tone changed quick and they turned their laughs into yelling and BOOING. Paisley didn’t say anything about Kaeapernick before showing the video, but apparently he is going to be showing it at all of his concerts!  What do you think about the video idea?",0,0,1
1052,"Their distaste for Donald Trump was no secret. But they saw no point in publicizing it. From Miami to Houston, Crawford to Kennebunkport, members of the Republican Party’s first family remained quiet for months, avoiding cameras and questions about presidential politics and focusing their few fundraiser appearances on assisting the GOP candidates who would be forced to share the November ballot with a nominee they detest. Story Continued Below But given the Bush clan’s proximity to public life, and their progeny’s desire to one day return the family to power, it was only a matter of time before they could hold their tongues no longer. Over a 24-hour span that began with Jeb Bush's surprising and sardonic cameo in Sunday's Emmy Awards broadcast and Monday night’s reports that his father, former President George H.W. Bush, had told a family friend privately that he intended to support Hillary Clinton, the Bushes returned to the headlines, and are giving Trump just the establishment foil he so capably exploits. ""He probably loves that former President Bush isn't backing him because it underlines his whole case against the establishment,"" one former Jeb Bush campaign staffer said. ""I bet he's highlighting it in his stump speech before long."" George W. Bush, who is headed to Washington this weekend to headline a fundraiser for Senate Republicans and attend the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, has shared in private settings for months his fear that he will be “the last Republican president.” And while Bush family loyalists say they do not know whether he is joking, they are certain he cannot support Trump. “When you have a Republican nominee who supported John Kerry in 2004 and implied that President Bush was responsible for 9/11 and has repeated the worst lies of the Michael Moore liberal Democrats, how in the world would the Bushes support that?” said one longtime GOP operative close to the Bush family. George H.W. Bush, at 92 years of age, is the freest to disavow allegiance to the party’s nominee. Although sources close to the former president indicate he would have preferred his vote remain confidential, he harbors a deep disgust for Trump, who mocked and insulted his son throughout the primary and whose life of shameless self-promotion and a coarse approach to politics are an affront to the cultivated gentility and pragmatic, big-tent conservatism he and his sons personify. “Forty-one instilled a duty and service mentality in the DNA of his boys,” said Slater Bayliss, an alumnus of Jeb Bush’s administration in Tallahassee and a supporter of his 2016 campaign. “I don’t think Jeb ran for president because it was best for him, but thought he could make a difference with a positive, policy-focused agenda. The fact that we would expect a guy who was a Republican president to support every future Republican presidential candidate is silly, especially when you have one like Donald Trump.” For George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, who has demurred on questions about how he’ll vote in the presidential race and focused on assisting down-ballot Republicans, there is also the consideration of the bond they share with the Clintons as members of an exclusive presidential fraternity and the disaster relief work they have collaborated on as ex-presidents. “There is a mutual regard that exists, despite their obvious political differences, between the families,” one source close to the Bush family said. “And also a mutual disregard, a shared disgust for Trump as someone so far outside of that club.” Those close to the family also doubt that any of the Bush women will privately cast a vote for Trump. Barbara Bush campaigned for Jeb in New Hampshire and lamented Trump’s foul language and desecration of the political norms her family always abided by. Laura Bush and her daughter Jenna Bush Hager have similarly expressed worries about Trump’s effect on the political discourse and pleaded the Fifth when asked whether they’d be voting for Trump. Jeb Bush, who prosecuted the case against Trump to little avail throughout the primary, has said publicly that he doesn’t plan to cast a ballot for Trump or Clinton — a reasonable position for someone who may hold out hopes of another presidential run or a position in a GOP administration down the road, should Trump lose in November and allow the party to reset itself for 2020. “I don’t know if it’s part of his thinking or not, but it would be a tough sell to the party to accept him if he’s on the record as having cast a vote for a Democratic nominee.” Interestingly enough, Jeb Bush’s son George P. Bush is the only family member publicly backing Trump. After watching the GOP nominee disparage, dismiss and eventually defeat his father, the Texas land commissioner, a telegenic Latino who has made no secret of his own ambitions for higher office, fell in line behind the party’s nominee, even though he acknowledged it being a “bitter pill to swallow.” “Donald Trump’s candidacy has divided Republican families around the country, and it sounds like this one’s no different,” said one Republican bundler who is close to the Bush family. The elder Bush’s admission that he plans to vote for Clinton occurred during a board meeting for the former president’s Thousand Points of Light Foundation. Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, asked Bush about his choice during a receiving line and got a frank answer — which she then posted to her Facebook page, prompting news reports Monday and Tuesday, confirming that Bush indeed plans to vote for Clinton. Several sources close to the former president expressed frustration Tuesday with the notion that Townsend would publicize what she heard while visiting a 92-year-old man’s living room, calling it a breach of privacy. But the former president himself issued no statement denying the reports of what he said. Even before news of Bush’s backing, Clinton’s campaign was running a television ad highlighting a number of Republicans criticizing Trump. And she has already won endorsements from many Republicans who worked in one or both Bush administrations. But just as early forecasts of a possible Bush-Clinton matchup were met with frustration and fatigue in the run-up to this year’s campaign cycle, confirmation this week of some sort of alliance between the families may only serve to harden the electorate’s obvious antipathy to dynastic, establishment politics. “The reality is, if all of this meant something, Donald Trump would not be the nominee,” said Bruce Haynes, a GOP consultant in Washington. “In Raleigh and Des Moines, people don’t give a damn about what the Bushes say or do. If anything, they see the establishment politicians closing ranks around Clinton and are more emboldened to do the opposite.”",1,0,0
901,"New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports: The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict. Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson. Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person  in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges. Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor. Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town. Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages. The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign. Watch his shame: ",0,1,0
576,"A former mayor in the State of Ohio has admitted to raping and molesting a little girl over a three year period, beginning when she was just 4 years old. However, what is more disturbing is the fact that he claims the child was a “willing participant” and initiated the acts. Richard Keenan, a former Hubbard mayor, admitted to the crimes, according to the Trumbull County Prosecutor’s Office. Vindy.com reports: Keenan, who served as Hubbard mayor in 2010 and 2011, was indicted last month on eight counts of rape and 12 counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. A rape conviction carries a sentence of life in prison. According to the filing by Assistant Prosecutor Gabriel Wildman, Keenan, 65, made the admissions to his wife, a pastor, a social worker and his brother and sister-in-law. Wildman’s filing states that when Keenan’s wife, Diana, heard about the assaults from the child, “upon confronting [her husband] about the allegations, [Keenan] responded, ‘I did it.'” The filing states Keenan also admitted sexual abuse during “group discussions” while he was in the ValleyCare Trumbull Memorial Hospital psychiatric ward. Keenan also had “in depth” conversations with his pastor in which he spoke of the molestation and rape. Mr. Keenan was also feeling suicidal because he had been abusing the child, according to a social worker from the Warren psychiatric facility, which he voluntarily admitted himself. He also said that the child initiated the act and even referred to her as a “willing participant.” Now, questions are being raised as to whether or not his wife and pastor are able to testify against him. The Ohio Rules of Evidence state that a spouse is considered “competent to be a witness if the testifying spouse elects to testify.” Additionally, the Ohio Revised Coder says that the pastor cannot be compelled to testify if “the confession or confidential communication was made directly to the cleric.” Keenan was indicted in August on eight counts of rape and twelve counts of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. He is free on $75,000 bond. If convicted, he faces life in prison. His trial is scheduled to be held prior to April 24, 2017. I have to ask, what need is there for a trial? Has the man not confessed to the crime? It is a waste of time and money. Furthermore, what is with sentencing a man to life in prison? Will his young victim not grow up to pay taxes to support food, clothing and housing for her rapist? What is just about that? We need a return to the Biblical model of law and justice, a model our forefathers followed.

618,"On an Ohio motorway a semi-truck was seen driving down the road. Most motorist that passed by the truck noticed nothing unusual about the unassuming truck. However, one motorists noticed the words on the back of the truck just below the bumper. The motorist immediately took a photo and posted it online. Now many are less than thrilled to know what was quietly passing through their state. While driving down the highway in Twinsburg, Ohio one driver noticed something on back of a big rig that stood out to him. He immediately took a closer look and saw what the driver had done to his truck's mudflaps. Now Black Lives Matter supporters are furious at the trucker's message, while many other patriots across the country are cheering in support. The picture that the unidentified driver of the truck took was sent and posted to the Ohio Going Blue Facebook page. It didn't take long after the pic was posted for it to go completely viral. The man cleverly chose to through the controversial theme that the Black Lives Matter movement is built on, the idea that only 'black' lives matter. The trucker's message smacked down those entitled blm thugs with his awesome 4-word statement.  The truck's mudflaps read ""Without cops, nothing matters."" A very true statement indeed that some of these blm cop-haters should really try to understand. Police do more than just deal out justice to those who break laws. They are the glue that holds together the fabric of society by maintaining order and preventing chaos. Without the protection and watch of our nation's police force many innocents would be robbed of their way of living and lives themselves. It is important to take a step back and realize what these men and women in blue really do for us each and every day. This truck driver obviously gets it and knows that the Black Lives Matter is clearly working their hardest to unravel the order that police have fought so hard to protect. Make sure to share this story on Facebook let us know if you think the Black Lives Matter movement only wants to create chaos and disorder for their own personal gains.

164,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump. First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote. In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation. As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process. âThereâs actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they wonât know the law, and theyâll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,â Gitlin said. âThat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.â As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim. And thatâs exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants. âWeâre going to watch Pennsylvania,â Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. âGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people donât come in and vote five times. If you do that, weâre not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion â I really mean this, Pennsylvania â is if cheating goes on.â Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to âStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!â In response to Trumpâs claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage. With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trumpâs favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else. ",0,1,0
733,"You’ve probably seen the bumper stickers that say, “Don’t like abortion? Don’t have one!” Perhaps during the slavery debate in our country, a similar bumper sticker could have read, “Don’t like slavery? Don’t own one!” Proponents argue that abortion doesn’t affect most people, so people shouldn’t care. It’s between a woman and her doctor. They say that pro-lifers shouldn’t be able to force their worldview down everyone else’s throats. They shouldn’t be able – through legislation – to “force” childbirth on women who don’t want to have babies. So, since the issue isn’t affecting anyone, except the mother – and the baby who doesn’t get a say, but that’s beside the point – it should be left solely up to the woman and her right to do with her body what she wants. (Even though the baby isn’t her body.) You could say the same thing about slavery. It didn’t affect anyone except the slave owner – and the slave, but they didn’t view slaves as people then (kind of like how unborn babies aren’t people either) – so, if you didn’t like slavery, good for you. Don’t own any. And don’t force your worldview down everyone else’s throats. Well, here’s one activist and head of an abortion rights group who’s comparing abortion to slavery. Except, she’s arguing that not allowing federal funding for abortion is tantamount to slavery. And allowing federal funding for abortion would be “setting women free.” Here’s CNS News: Kierra Johnson, executive director of URGE: Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, testified Friday before the House Judiciary Committee examining the Hyde Amendment, which forbids the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest, and compared the amendment to slavery, saying that repealing the Hyde Amendment is about “setting us (women) free.” Johnson responded to a question on the impact of the Hyde amendment on low-income women, referencing an earlier comment from Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) in which he compared the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision to abortion, saying, “It’s interesting that we’re bringing up slavery in this space. When you own somebody’s decision-making, you own them.” “The Hyde amendment is about increasing coverage of insurance,” she argued. “It is about returning decision-making back to women. It’s about setting us free. “When you get to decide for them whether or not their body has value, you own them whether you decide they’re valuable as black or not, you actually don’t get to make that decision,” Johnson emphasized. “We are valuable, and women are valuable. The Hyde amendment simply says set us free,” she said. “We are not simple-minded. We are not being duped. Women are choosing to be pregnant and have children. The majority of women who have abortions are parents. They care, they care about their families.” “We should repeal the Hyde Amendment,” she concluded. There should be no federal funding for abortion, period, regardless of how the baby was conceived. In the vast majority of cases, people want abortion for convenience. They want sex without consequences. Even in the cases of rape and incest – while those instances are tragic – you don’t punish the baby. It wasn’t the baby’s fault. The baby merely becomes an innocent bystander. Instead of punishing the baby, the rapist should be the one to be aborted.

891,"The police officer who shot unarmed motorist Terence Crutcher has been charged with first-degree manslaughter and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. Crutcher had been driving home from community college when his SUV broke down. Officer Betty Shelby, who has a past history of domestic violence and drug abuse, was on her way to answer a domestic dispute when she encountered Crutcher and the SUV. She stopped, initiated the confrontation with Crutcher, and shot him dead, even though he clearly has his hands up and was unarmed. Her radio communications show that she called him a “bad dude” even though there was no reason to do so. While the charges are a good sign that justice will be carried out, we must remember that not a single police officer was convicted of unlawfully killing a civilian last year. Nor were any convicted in 2014. Since 2005, only thirteen cops have been brought to justice for executing civilians. “Juries and judges seem reluctant to second-guess the split-second life or death decisions of police officers in violent street encounters in the course of their job … and will give the benefit of every doubt to an officer on trial in these cases” says criminology professor Phillip Stintson.   We’d appreciate it if they began to give the people they ostensibly are “protecting and serving” the same benefit of the doubt. Here is video of the shooting. Viewer discretion is advised; as Police Chief Chuck Jordan remarked, “it is very disturbing.”",0,1,0
391,"Washington (CNN)Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Anthony Weiner's cell phone and other records, according to law enforcement officials. The FBI and the New York Police Department have opened preliminary investigations of allegations that the former New York Democratic congressman exchanged sexually explicit text messages with a purportedly underage girl. Spokespersons for the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan and the FBI declined to comment. The allegations first surfaced in the Daily Mail. The online sexting relationship allegedly went on for months between Weiner and a girl claiming to be just 15. The Daily Mail reported she said he sent her numerous photos, one of him in a pool and at least one bare-chested. The outlet reported that the girl said she reached out to Weiner in January on Twitter. In a statement to CNN, Weiner neither confirmed or denied sending the texts. ""I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt,"" he said. Weiner continued: ""While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax, I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position. I am sorry."" CNN has not been able to confirm this was a hoax. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump noted that Weiner donated $550 to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign last year. ""The announcement by the FBI and New York Police Department that they are investigating close Clinton ally Anthony Weiner's inappropriate relationship with an underaged female is extremely disturbing,"" Jessica Ditto said. ""The Clinton campaign should immediately return all campaign contributions from Weiner. America has had enough of the sleaze that is Clinton, Inc."" Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides, announced last month that she was separating from Weiner after photos emerged of him allegedly sexting with another woman while their son was in bed with him. That woman was described in the New York Post as a 40-something divorced woman from the West. Weiner left Congress in June 2011 when sexually-charged, sometimes explicit, texts with women other than his wife first emerged. His social media habits continued after leaving Congress and contributed to his poor showing in the 2013 New York City mayoral race, a contest in which he had once been a leading contender.

343,"Washington (CNN)New Jersey governor and Donald Trump surrogate Chris Christie called Hillary Clinton ""a disgrace"" after she connected recent police shootings to ""systematic racism"" -- hours after the GOP nominee said he was ""very troubled"" by a recent incident in Oklahoma. ""She's a disgrace. She's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,"" Christie said Wednesday on ""The Laura Ingraham Show."" ""It's typical of Hillary Clinton. She knows nothing but the mouth never stops."" Trump, however, has also displayed a tendency to speak about events before all the facts are made clear. He notably called the explosion in New York City over the weekend a ""bomb"" 30 minutes after the incident, despite a lack of official confirmation. Ingraham played comments Clinton made Tuesday on ""The Steve Harvey Show"" following the shooting of Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old unarmed black man shot dead by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""And we've got to tackle systemic racism -- this horrible shooting again,"" Clinton said. ""How many times do we have to see this in our country? In Tulsa, an unarmed man with his hands in the air? I mean, this is just unbearable, and it needs to be intolerable. And so maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people, say, look, this is not who we are."" Trump, speaking Wednesday in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, at a minority voter outreach event, also expressed concern about the shooting. ""I must tell you, I watched the shooting, in particular in Tulsa, and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. To me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do,"" Trump said. ""And he looked like a really good man -- and maybe I'm a little clouded because I saw his family talking about him after the fact ... but he looked like somebody who was doing what they were asking him to do."" Christie -- speaking hours after Clinton condemned the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina -- said the former secretary of state doesn't know enough about policing to draw any conclusions. ""The fact is she has no idea what happened in North Carolina,"" he said. ""The same way, as you very aptly pointed out Laura, people jumped to conclusions in Ferguson, which caused riot conditions in Ferguson, because of politicians dumping gasoline on a fire."" The Clinton campaign has said she hopes to develop national best practices for police to help them manage situations like those in Tulsa and Charlotte. But Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said Clinton had ""no experience in law enforcement except for being interviewed by them."" ""I'm just appalled, and as someone who spent seven years in law enforcement, she's exactly the kind of politician that law enforcement loathes, loathes her,"" Christie added. ""Because she jumps to conclusions for political gain and doesn't care what careers or lives she ruins in the process."" ",1,0,0
1077,"Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday he expects the House will vote to override any presidential veto of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, despite his concerns that the measure could touch off a wave of retaliatory lawsuits. “I really don’t know the answer to that question,” Ryan (R-Wis.) said when asked if the House would take up a veto override this month before Congress prepares to leave until after Election Day. But Ryan did not say exactly when he expected the override vote to happen. Story Continued Below “It depends on how long it takes for us to get our other work done. I heard that the Senate majority leader said they’re going to stay so if we’re in and they pass it, then it’s going to come over here and we’ll pass it,” he added. President Barack Obama has said he will veto the measure, which passed both chambers unanimously, in part over concerns that the bill could open up U.S. officials to legal retaliation in foreign courts. He has until the end of the week to issue his veto. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said his chamber will take up the veto override vote before leaving for recess. Ryan said he has concerns with the bill, listing many of the same complaints voiced by the White House, but that shouldn’t stop the veto override from coming up for a vote. “I worry about legal matters. I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about precedence. At the same time, these victims need to have their day in court,” Ryan told reporters. “I do have concerns about the legislation but I’m going to let Congress work its will because that’s what Congress does. I do think the votes are there for the override.”",1,0,0
528,"Washington (CNN)Rudy Giuliani blasted Hillary Clinton as ""too stupid to be president"" because she stayed with her husband after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ""She didn't just stand by him -- she attacked Monica Lewinsky, and after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn't know the moment Monica Lewinsky said Bill Clinton violated her and was telling the truth -- then you're too stupid to be president,"" the former New York City mayor and prominent Donald Trump surrogate told Elite Daily shortly after Monday night's debate. Trump told CNN's Dana Bash shortly after the debate concluded that he was ""very happy that I was able to hold back on the -- you know, on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton, because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn't want to say what I was going to say."" Giuliani said the GOP nominee's biggest mistake during the debate was being ""too reserved and too gentlemanly."" Had he been debating, Giuliani said, he would have ""talked about what she did to Monica Lewinsky, what that woman standing there did to Monica Lewinsky."" The Lewinsky scandal resulted in Bill Clinton being impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was ultimately acquitted in the Senate. When news of the scandal first broke in 1998, Clinton led the White House's behind-the-scenes damage-control efforts and appeared on several news programs to defend her husband, blaming the allegations on a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" that she said was part of a political effort to bring down the president. Giuliani, however, accused Clinton of ""trying to paint her as an insane young woman."" He did not offer any proof in his interview and a message left with the Clinton campaign seeking response was not immediately returned. Giuliani and Trump have both been married three times and engaged in extramarital relationships that have led to past divorces. But asked about Trump's hint that he could bring up Bill Clinton's infidelity at an upcoming debate, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Tuesday that the former first lady was ""ready for anything."" ""This is -- it's such an obvious dodge. He spiraled out at the end of the debate and so, of course, he wants to bully. He wants to talk about the supposed indiscretions,"" Mook said.

849,"There’s a plague sweeping across the nation. One that has one washed up football player feeling pretty good about himself. The attention he is getting from his nonsense, is off the charts. (I realize, I’m not helping, but you need to know what’s going on so…) It’s the Kaepernick Plague. It’s wiping out once respected NFL players and really ruined my Monday night football when I learned the Seahawks were talking a bunch of crazy talk. Stupid Kaepernick couldn’t leave my team alone!? Anyhow… Now, you see High School teams, and cheerleaders acting a fool. Pulling a Kaepernick number that should have never gotten an encore. This is when you know stupid has taken over… Half of American ADULTS don’t understand what Kaepernick is doing or why, how do these kids understand it? Seriously, they are doing what they do best at that age, jumping on a bandwagon because it’s apparently the ‘new thing’ to do. Yet, Kaepernick takes pride in it. In fact, so much so that he visited a High School football game in Oakland. You’ll never guess in a million years the kind of stunt they pulled off in HIS honor. Not the honor of what he is claiming to stand for…but in honor of HIM.

924,"Every Presidential nominee since 1976 has released their tax returns except for Republicans Donald Trump and Gerald Ford. Debate moderator Lester Holt put Trump on the spot about releasing his returns, and he filibustered, hemmed and hawed intensely, used the old “I’m waiting for an audit to finish” excuse, and then actually dropped a shocking revelation – saying he’s been under audit for 15 years now! – before unleashing a horde of “4 Pinocchio” level lies. The IRS has confirmed time and time again that there is nothing preventing Trump from releasing his returns, and noting that it is very unusual to be under audit for so long, implying that there’s something foul at play. But this hasn’t been just a dodgy situation in this campaign; Trump promised to release his returns if President Obama released his birth certificate. We all know how that turned out: In 2011, when Trump was spearheading the movement questioning whether President Obama was born in the United States, Trump told ABC News that he would release his tax returns if Obama released his long-form birth certificate. “I’d love to give my tax returns,” he said. But once Obama released his birth certificate, Trump hedged. “At the appropriate time I’m going to do it,” he said. The appropriate time never came. It turns out that Trump has been under audit for 15 years! It also turns out that the repeated questions about Trump’s missing tax returns did yield one revelation from the Republican nominee – he tacitly admitted he doesn’t pay income tax, and he thinks that’s great because it makes him “smart” and not greedy. In the end, Hillary Clinton scored her very best zinger of the night after Trump looked like a one armed wall-paper hanger with crabs, trying to cover up a very large wall, with nothing more than shameful lies and promises, and certainly none of his tax papers which the American people deserve to see before voting for this country’s President.

1274,"Last October, Hillary Clinton and her top aides were debating one of those seemingly trivial yet politically consequential decisions that often bedevil a Me Generation candidate in the YouTube era. Should Clinton, at times cautious to the point of rigidity, sing a boozy ballad with her Saturday Night Live impersonator Kate McKinnon at the end of her turn as “Val the Bartender?” Story Continued Below The internal debate ebbed back and forth -- the candidate herself was ambivalent and some aides thought it would make her look silly. Quietly, they reached out to Philippe Reines, a former Senate and State Department aide who hadn’t been invited to work on the 2016 campaign, yet had always helped to manage her big-stage moments in the past. Reines urged her to do it. He flew with Clinton in a private jet to New York, negotiated some details of her appearance with the writers at NBC, and stood backstage while she was warbling “Lean on Me” to provide moral support, according to two people familiar with the situation. The selection of the colorful, combative, cloak-and-dagger, defiantly wise-ass Reines as Donald Trump’s stand-in during debate prep sessions, first reported by the New York Times on Saturday, came as a surprise to many outsiders. The idea: Clinton’s in-house Trump to be someone with no vested interest in pulling a punch -- like SNL alum Al Franken, the Minnesota senator; or financier Robert Wolf, who lobbied for the gig. But it was no shock to the people who know the candidate or the 46-year-old Reines, who lives a bachelor’s life in Washington with two doted-upon cats named after Saddam Hussein’s sons, Uday and Qusay. Clinton, facing what could be the biggest night of her political life on Monday when she squares off against Trump in the first presidential debate of 2016, made an intuitive, even predictable choice, turning to a member of the tiny inner circle she has often relied on in times of maximum stress. The fact that she would tap a trusted defender to portray her most savage enemy says a lot about Clinton’s management style, and her circle-the-wagons psyche even during times when other politicians might reach outside for help. There’s staff, and then there’s the palace guard – and Reines, despite an up-and-down career with Clinton, is practically Jaime Lannister. “The debate prep team is made up of people who are really comfortable with her and she's comfortable with them,” said Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle, who began her career as young member of Clinton’s Hillaryland posse in the East Wing in the 1990s. “Everybody’s always saying Hillary needs to project her authentic self, but Philippe is one of the only ones who knows what that is, and knows how to get her to go along with that,” said a person who knows both. “He’s the one who urges her to abandon the caution, to go for it. And she’ll listen to him, and that’s because she trusts him.” Clinton’s relaxed SNL appearance, self-deprecating but dignified spot, shows why. She flubbed the song but laughed her way through it – and It worked. That hasn’t always been the case for a 68-year-old pop culture staple who struggles to understand pop culture: Many on her staff still regret letting the boss do a deeply awkward version of the ""nae nae"" dance on the Ellen Show. Clinton also trusts Reines precisely because he shares her skepticism – bordering on hostility – toward most of the D.C. and national political press to whom he routinely refers as “idiots” or worse in private conversation. He’s famous for his flame-out emails to reporters over the years -- calling former POLITICO blogger and current BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith a moron in a 2008 email, telling the late BuzzFeed correspondent Michael Hastings to f—k off in another, and challenging yours truly in 2009 to take a lie-detector test after it was suggested Reines was scheming to force Caroline Kennedy out of contention for Clinton’s vacated Senate seat in New York. Clinton aides expressed astonishment that the fake Trump’s identity hadn’t been ferreted out sooner – Reines has, according to one person with direct knowledge of his involvement, participated in as many as a half-dozen mock debates and more relaxed moot-court sessions, peppering the candidate with lines cribbed from Trump’s primary debates and personal attacks meant to keep the candidate off balance. “Nothing is really off-limits,” the person told POLITICO. “In some ways it’s easier for him to say these nasty things to her because she knows he has her best interests at heart.” His brushes with the media – and his flamethrower reputation with fellow staffers – left him largely on the sidelines in 2008 until he emerged, late in the primaries, as a travelling adviser and PR bodyguard for Chelsea Clinton – and, consequentially, as a late add to her debate-prep team. Reines’ relationship with Hillary Clinton is personally close, but has been professionally rocky from time to time; she has long told people she likes him “because he makes me laugh,” but has lectured him for picking public fights and nearly sacked him when he worked for her in the Senate for a variety of over-the-top transgressions, according to former Clinton staffers. Controversy followed him to Foggy Bottom, where he waged endless turf battles and was rapped over the knuckles in an inspector general’s report. And Clinton was none too happy when Reines, who has a weakness for too-clever-by-half schemes, handed her a Staples “Reset” button to deliver to dour Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov – only to be told the Cyrillic inscription was wrong. But Reines endeared himself in other ways, and exhibited skills that serve him in his role as debate stand-in. In 2007, Reines – then a member of Clinton’s Senate staff – oversaw an effort to discredit and defuse a pair of potentially damaging biographies of his boss. He obtained bootlegged pre-publication printouts of the tomes from various sources and distributed the contents to a team of researchers who scoured the texts for errors, inconsistencies and off-key passages he later trotted out in Clinton’s defense. “Is it possible to quote me yawning?” Reines said when asked to summarize the contents of an investigative biography penned by two New York Times scribes. She loved that one, and has rewarded him with loyalty, even when other called for his scalp. When Clinton accepted Barack Obama’s invitation to run the State Department in late 2008, Obama’s deputy chief of staff Jim Messina tried to block his appointment as a strategic adviser assigned to Clinton’s personal staff – and the new secretary overruled the decision and installed Reines as a central member of a management team that included longtime Clinton confidante Cheryl Mills, aide-de-camp Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, who is now her campaign policy chief. Prior to the Democratic convention in late July, Reines, who works at a consulting firm that specializes in defense and foreign policy, had been speaking with Clinton from time to time on messaging and press issues, but “not in a regular, systematic way,” according to one Clinton insider. Around the time of Clinton’s SNL appearance, Reines accompanied Clinton on a flight to a town hall in New Hampshire moderated by Reines’ friend, “Today” show co-host Savannah Guthrie – but he kept a low profile after that. Then, after the Democratic National Convention, Clinton’s staff began informally kicking around names for people to play Trump – a list that included Franken, along with entrepreneur and reality show host Mark Cuban. The sticking point with all of those people, sources told POLITICO, was the candidate’s comfort level. It’s not clear who came up with the idea of tapping him but Sullivan, Abedin and Karen Dunn, one of the lawyers overseeing debate prep sessions (and a Reines friend), backed the idea – and Clinton quickly approved. There was another consideration: Reines had a day job, but controlled his own hours, and the Trump role, above all, requires “someone who has lots and lots of free time,” according to one Brooklyn aide. It also required days of cramming, along with hours of YouTube-watching to replicate Trump’s distinctive speech patterns and habitual lines of attack. Yet there was one skill Reines didn’t have to study up on: New York attitude. “I was a good Bush for Gore because I am stupid but cocky,” said Paul Begala, a central player in Al Gore’s ill-fated 2000 debate prep effort. “Philippe is a good Trump for Hillary because he is clever but obnoxious.” Annie Karni and Rebecca Morin contributed.",1,0,0
1177,"Hillary Clinton’s nationwide lead over Donald Trump has tightened to single digits with just three days to go before the first presidential debate between the two candidates. A new McClatchy-Marist poll released Friday puts the former secretary of state 7 percentage points ahead of the Manhattan billionaire in a head-to-head matchup among likely voters, 48 percent to 41 percent. That lead is down significantly from the 15-point advantage she held in an earlier McClatchy-Marist poll that surveyed registered voters nationwide in early August. Story Continued Below In a four-way race that also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein, Clinton leads Trump by 6 points, 45 percent to 39 percent. Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, polled at 10 percent and Stein polled at 4 percent. Respondents preferred Clinton on the issue of immigration by a 51-41 margin and on trade by a 52-42 spread. Asked which candidate would better address the issue of terrorism, respondents favored Clinton, 52 percent to 41 percent. Fifty-seven percent of those reached said Clinton has the experience to serve in the White House, compared to just 30 percent who said the same of Trump. Likely voters reached by the poll also gave her the edge on the question of temperament, preferring her by a 50-38 margin. While recent nationwide polls have favored Clinton of late, it is Trump who has received mostly good news in swing state polling. Surveys released in recent days have shown him ahead in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio, while another put him and Clinton in a statistical tie in Florida. Winning in battleground states like those are crucial for Trump, who faces a relatively narrow electoral path to the White House relative to Clinton. The McClatchy-Marist poll was conducted from Sept. 15-20, reaching 1,298 adults via landlines and cell phones. Of those 1,298 respondents, 758 were considered likely voters based on a probability turnout model. The margin of error for all respondents was plus-or-minus 2.7 percentage points and the margin of error for likely voters was plus-or-minus 3.6 points.",1,0,0
709,"The Hillary Clinton staff dismissed State Department IT technician concerns over private server. Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s Chief of Staff said that other Secretaries of State had done it. As you remember, that was their excuse; everybody did it. Then they went on to say that Colin Powell endorsed it. The liberal mantra: Blame anyone, but don’t take responsibility. Read more below.  As Written By Katie Bo Williams for The Hill: The State Department technician who set up Hillary Clinton’s private server told FBI officials that he conveyed internal concerns that the setup violated federal record-keeping rules to Clinton’s “inner circle,” according to investigation notes released Friday afternoon. Bryan Pagliano told investigators that in 2009, two State IT specialists asked him whether he was aware of the clintonemail.com domain, then asked him to relay to Clinton’s team that the server could be a federal records retention issue. Pagliano conveyed the message to Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s chief of staff during her tenure as secretary of State. He told investigators that Mills replied that other secretaries of State had also used private email accounts, citing Colin Powell. The details come from 189 pages of notes from the FBI’s interviews with State officials, Clinton aides, IT technicians who worked on the server and others, released late Friday afternoon. The pages contain a few previously-unknown tidbits — including the revelation that Clinton at one point had a Gmail account, used so an unnamed aide could send her articles of interest to read. But the aide said he was “fairly sure” that the account was never used after it was ….

1239,"The Obama administration Monday is calling on cities and counties to rethink their zoning laws, saying that antiquated rules on construction, housing and land use are contributing to high rents and income inequality, and dragging down the U.S. economy as a whole. City zoning battles usually are fought block by block, and the president's involvement will create friction, particularly among environmental groups and the not-in-my-backyard crowd. But the White House jawboning is welcome news to many others, including mayors and builders increasingly foiled by community opposition to development. Story Continued Below The White House published a “toolkit” of economic evidence and policy fixes to help local political leaders fight back against the NIMBYs that tend to hold sway over municipal zoning meetings. “In more and more regions across the country, local and neighborhood leaders have said yes in our backyard,” the paper states. “We need to break down the rules that stand in the way of building new housing.” The prescriptions call for more density, speedier permitting and fewer restrictions on accessory dwelling units such as basement and garage apartments. The plan rejects some of the arguments made by environmentalists, labor unions and other liberal constituencies that have stood in the way of development and endorses changes long sought by builders and the business community. “When unnecessary barriers restrict the supply of housing and costs increase, then workers, particularly lower-income workers who would benefit the most, are less able to move to high-productivity cities,” said Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. “All told, this means slower economic growth.” Zoning policy might seem picayune for a president, but eight years after the foreclosure crisis left the country littered with empty homes, the country is facing a critical housing shortage in its most vibrant job centers. The result is soaring rents, growing income inequality and sputtering economic growth nationwide. By one estimate, barriers to development in major cities have shaved as much as $1.95 trillion a year off U.S. economic growth. “It’s important that the president is talking about it,” said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute. “Local restrictions on housing supply are a crucial economic issue. I would say it’s one of the top 10.” There’s not much the White House can do beyond talk. The administration’s 2017 budget request includes $300 million in grants to help mayors update zoning rules, and the Department of Transportation has begun weighing plans for housing growth and affordability before approving funding for certain transit projects. Despite a growing consensus among economists that slow-growth policies of the 1970s are hurting job and income growth, many elected officials continue to face local opposition to liberalized development. Earlier this year, environmentalists and labor unions quickly shut down a plan by California Gov. Jerry Brown that would have made it easier for developers to build apartments and condominiums. The proposal got nowhere, despite the support of mayors, businesses and the White House. The case illustrates the steep road to change and the need for high-profile jawboning, Calabria said. “Normally governors don’t like to get involved in local land-use decisions,” Calabria said. “And if you have a president talking about it, that’s unusual.”",1,0,0
774,"NFL spirals even further into the gutter after the Miami Dolphins announce that they will be joining in on the Kaepernick roadshow of disrespecting, ungrateful, and entitled MULTI-MILLIONS-DOLLAR idiot athletes. This time though…there will be consequences for their stupidity. Just as they made the announcement, the police union also had one of theirs’ to make, and you might like this. Like…a lot. The Dolphin players who are sitting out during the “Star-Spangled Banner” believe that their butt to chair crap is going to help the black community. Of course, using their multi-millions to help make the community better isn’t their idea of helping…no, that would be too much for them to commit to. So instead, they take easiest more INEFFECTIVE choice…because they are selfish a-holes like that. …yet the ‘black community’ they are “helping” adores them for it. Really? It’s insanity really. Their dishonorable Black Lives Matter protest is against the very men and women who are willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING, and have proven it time and time again when they HAVE. It’s sick. Of course, many are not taking a stand for something they believe in but taking a stand to try and stay relevant. Just like Colin Kaepernick, his career was deteriorating…and he needed something. However, what they probably don’t get yet…is in this case, not even BAD publicity is going to be good for them. Not when it involves hatred towards our heroes. That’s just bad form… So now, guess what? Since the Dolphin players have confirmed that they will continue kneeling during the National Anthem, the police union has responded with their own announcement. They are calling for Broward County Sheriff’s Office to stop providing police escorts for the ungrateful, selfish, and wretched team. Association president Jeff Bell announced on the union’s Facebook page that they have contacted the executive board not only to condemn the anti-police, pro-BLM actions of the Dolphins but also to request that they cease attending events in which they’re unwanted. “We have buried coworkers who have unnecessarily lost their lives protecting the lives of individuals. Some law enforcement officers even lost their lives while protecting the lives of the very same individuals who were protesting against law enforcement. The Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association Local 6020 is seeking the immediate termination of all Miami Dolphin escorts until such time the Miami Dolphins and the National Football League set forth a policy that will not tolerate the disrespect of the American Flag and National Anthem during any sanctioned games or events.” Of course the police union understands that it is the right of these entitled morons to choose to disrespect the flag, and country that allows them to live out their dreams…but it is also the right of the police officers to decide that they won’t provide optional security to those who don’t want them there and wish them harm because of ignorance. How hypocritical right? I’m embarrassed really. The world is definitely rooting for America to win, because if we don’t…they don’t either. However, I’m sure they are watching in on what is happening here…and shaking their heads. We are no longer a leading nation…that others can look to and respect. Not with that idiot President in the White House that only knows how to lead from behind, divide a people, and cause chaos among brothers and sisters. He is no leader…look at the garbage that is going on now. Of course, the 4 Miami players who refused to stand for the anthem immediately attempted to downplay their disrespect after word surfaced that the sheriff’s office may boycott their events. According to the Daily Dolphin, Jelani Jenkins provided an absurdly hypocritical response, saying that he wasn’t insulting law enforcement or the military. “Most important, man, I just want equal rights for everybody,” Jenkins said Sunday. “Hopefully we’re raising awareness and pushing for change. I want it to be known that it’s no disrespect to the military or to police officers. And 9/11, I respect everything about it. My perspective is that there are people hurting. It means a lot to me to not be quiet about it.” So minorities in America don’t have equal rights? Well if that were true, I myself would not even exist. My parents immigrated to America with nothing but their hard work ethic, and hope for better days in a free land. Now they are living their dreams that were awarded to them by this free country through their sheer will power and hard work. Also, raising up 3 great Police Officers to serve and protect in their communities and me… who chooses to follow in their footsteps in teaching my children to be grateful and have love for country and respect and honor for our heroes. So… these fools, can take a seat. Their message is redundant. ",0,0,1
992,"Former President George H.W. Bush is bucking his party's presidential nominee and plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to a member of another famous political family, the Kennedys. Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Story Continued Below On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: ""The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!” In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. “That’s what he said,” she told POLITICO. Asked about Townsend’s post, George H.W. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied, ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim."" George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush have stayed out of the political debate since campaigning earlier this year for their son Jeb's unsuccessful bid for president. Neither George H.W. Bush nor his son, former President George W. Bush, attended this summer's Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Trump accepted the nomination. Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. One Bush official who has taken Trump's side is former Vice President Dan Quayle, who told POLITICO in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump. ""Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president, but they can speak for themselves,"" Quayle said in an interview in July.",1,0,0
668,"A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison. The UK’s Express reports: Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein. The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles. During the trial Jama B. boasted: “I’m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.” … Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime. A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, “Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case. “Therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.” Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure. Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, “The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused. “The fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.” What’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney. “It was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” Peter Boysen said. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not. Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing. “The incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.  “This is the verdict that shames you all.” People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire. Don’t think it won’t be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not. In a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.

1521,"You’ve got to be freaking kidding me. This is just simply unbelievable. Not only was the Hildabeast’s IT guy granted immunity, they gave immunity to Cheryl Mills and two other staff members. No wonder they couldn’t convict her. The revelations of the immunity granted left Republicans in utter shock. Then they got furious, but I guess they got out-maneuvered on this one. I told you these people aren’t stupid. There were a myriad of ways that Mills herself violated the law or at a minimum assisted Clinton in skirting it. In the New York Post earlier this month, Paul Sperry bluntly accused Mills of being the evil mastermind behind the Clinton email coverup: … Mills ultimately made the determinations about which emails should be preserved before she and Clinton decided to delete the rest as “personal” … Mills was the one who ordered the server host to move the emails from the server to a laptop where she could screen them … And Mills may have been a key player in the game of hide-and-seek.  From The Federalist Papers Project: Another top aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton was granted immunity by President Barack Obama’s Department of JusticeInjustice during the FBI’s investigation into the former Secretary of State’s use of a private email server, reported theAssociated Press. Specifically, the FBI provided Clinton’s former chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, and two other staff members with immunity. The bombshell revelation reportedly left congressional Republicans in utter shock. “No wonder they couldn’t prosecute a case,” remarked Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “They were handing out immunity deals like candy.” Consider also why the FBI granted immunity — to procure more evidence to use against Secretary Clinton. Yet the Department ultimately failed to acquire enough evidence to pursue charges against her, as Director James Comey tried to explain two months ago:   Every official in and out of the FBI involved in this whole investigation should be brought to account for this and should at the very least, lose their jobs, if not go to prison. According to the final House Benghazi Committee Report released three months ago, as reported by Politico, Mills also tainted “the findings of an internal State Department review of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack.” Why in the hell would you grant this woman immunity? Oh, I know why! You never had any intention of prosecuting ANYONE involved. Instead the FBI was so corrupt they handed out immunity deals like candy and everyone walked. The FBI is no longer viable. They need to be gutted and rebooted. Seriously. ",0,0,1
655,"The House Oversight Committee has ordered the website Reddit to preserve copies of posts purportedly published by the computer technician who appears to have asked for advice for how to strip Hillary Clinton’s email address from her emails. (If you are unfamiliar with the story, read this first) Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight Committee, told The Hill that the order “has the weight of law, you can’t destroy things and hope things magically get erased.” The posts in question appear to have been made by Paul Combetta, a technician at Platte River Networks, a Denver-based computer firm that Clinton hired in 2013 to manage her private server. They were deleted on Monday, just after Internet sleuths discovered them and circulated them across the Web. In the posts, a user going by the handle “stonetear” asked other users for advice on how to “strip out” email addresses from the account of a “VIP.” “Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out,” reads the post, which was published on July 24, 2014. That date is a significant point on the Clinton email timeline. Just the day before, the House Select Committee on Benghazi had reached an agreement with the State Department to obtain Clinton’s work-related emails. The FBI’s report of its investigation of Clinton’s emails shows that that same month, Combetta transferred backups of Clinton’s emails to two of her lawyers, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson. “Stonetear’s” post on Reddit raises questions about what was being covered up. And if “stonetear” is Combetta, as seems likely, the Reddit post would not be the first example of the technician engaging in an apparent cover-up. Combetta is the technician who used a software program called BleachBit to delete backups of Clinton’s emails in late March 2015, weeks after Clinton’s email setup was revealed in the press and after Congress had subpoenaed all of her records. He also lied to the FBI during an initial interview about his decision to use BleachBit. Regardless, the Justice Department granted him immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the email investigation. Last week, Combetta and another Platte River Networks technician named Bill Thornton declined to testify at a House Oversight Committee hearing. Both technicians pleaded the Fifth. The allegations that Combetta posted questions about Clinton’s server on Reddit “fit the pattern of what we think was happening,” Chaffetz told The Hill. Another Oversight Committee member, North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, said that while the circumstantial evidence “certainly points in one direction” — that “stonetear” is Combetta — the Committee wants to have definitive proof that he is. “We’re just trying to make doubly sure that we can authenticate that in a real way, because if not it will be challenged on a number of fronts,” Meadows told The Hill. Chaffetz also said that the committee has to verify the authenticity of the posts, “but we are pursuing it with vigor.” Numerous clues have surfaced which strongly suggest that “stonetear” is Combetta. Combetta’s email address is [email protected] , and other posts from the user refer to facts known about Combetta, such as that he lives in Rhode Island. TheDC uncovered other clues which lend more evidence to support the case that Combetta is the Reddit user. In some of the Reddit posts, “stonetear” refers to an email encryption service that Platte River Networks uses called Mimecast. He also refers to Datto, Inc., a cloud storage company that PRN hired to service Clinton’s server. A spokesman for Platte River Networks told TheDC on Tuesday that the company is not yet ready to comment on the matter but that it will “soon.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

However, the savages that comprise ISIS have certainly never been accused of being civilized… Early reports indicate that ISIS has used chemical weapons on U.S. troops in Iraq.   Several U.S. officials have claimed that ISIS fired a shell filled with Mustard Gas into Qayyara Air Base in Iraq on Tuesday where U.S. and Iraqi troops are stationed. The shell was either a rocket or an artillery shell and was promptly tested and revealed to contain a chemical agent that reports indicate was Mustard Gas. No troops were injured in the attack and no troops have yet showed any signs or symptoms of the effects of Mustard Gas. According to one official, the weapon was poorly weaponized and the chemical was of “low purity.” U.S. officials have anticipated an attack of this nature as several hundred U.S. troops remain stationed just outside of Mosul to assist Iraqi forces in taking-back Mosul from ISIS. Pentagon officials have maintained that U.S. airstrikes have been hitting locations where it is believed that ISIS is manufacturing chemicals like Mustard Gas. However, Mustard Gas is fairly easy to produce and while our airstrikes have been effective, it is unlikely that our efforts will cease production of such weapons. While President Obama and his band of weakling followers cannot be blamed for each vile act conducted by ISIS, they can be blamed for not taking seriously enough the resolve of the terrorist groups fighting to the death to kill so-called infidels. Though President Obama seems pleased with his oh-so-gentle brand of targeted airstrikes, our military engagement in the Middle East does little but inconvenience ISIS as they march onward towards more death and destruction. While Obama applies the least amount of military pressure possible, ISIS is experimenting with chemical weapons. Who seems to be taking this fight more seriously? ",0,0,1
32,"The Clinton campaign has slammed Donald Trump as “a fraud who believes the rules don’t apply to him” over reports that the GOP presidential candidate used money from his charitable foundation to settle two lawsuits filed against his for-profit businesses. The Washington Post reported today that Trump made two payments totaling $258,000 to settle suits — one involving the Mar-a-Lago Club, which he owns, in Florida and another involving one of his golf clubs in New York.  Clinton’s deputy communications director, Christina Reynolds, put out a statement after The Washington Post story was published, calling Trump a fraud. “Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education,” she said. “Trump’s version of charity is taking money from others to settle his own legal issues ... which experts say is a clear violation of laws governing charitable organizations,” Reynolds said.   ABC News has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.     Lloyd Mayer, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News that if the allegations made by the Post are true, the payments violate federal law.   “Federal tax law bars a private foundation like the Trump Foundation from using its assets to benefit its insiders or the businesses they own. That’s exactly what’s been alleged here. If true, the foundation and its managers, including Mr. Trump, violated tax laws,” Mayer told ABC News.  The lawsuit involving Mar-a-Lago, filed in 2007, revolved around a complaint by the town of Palm Beach over an oversize flagpole at the club. Publicly available court documents show that as a condition of a settlement, “Mr. Trump will contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between the parties” in return for the town’s waiving fines against Mar-a-Lago. Another section of the court documents specified, “Mar-a-Lago shall contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between parties dealing with Iraq War veterans, American flag or the local VA hospital.”   In a September 2007 letter to the town, as reported by the Post, Trump wrote, “I have sent a check for $100,000 to Fisher House. Although the court documents show that under the settlement, Trump or Mar-a-Lago would make the payment, the payment apparently instead came from the Trump Foundation. Tax forms for the Trump Foundation show that in 2007 the charity gave $100,000 to Fisher House, an organization that helps pay for housing for veterans’ relatives when their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. It was one of only three $100,000 donations it made that year; the other two were to a New York hospital and a police athletic league. Fisher House confirmed to ABC News that it received a $100,000 check from the foundation on Sept. 11, 2007. It does not have a copy of the check available.  The IRS has strict rules on the operation of tax-exempt private foundations, including against what it calls self-dealing. To qualify for tax-exempt status, a foundation is required to demonstrate, among other things, that “no part of its net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,” according to an online IRS publication. Mayer noted that if the lawsuit settlement was paid for by Trump’s foundation, he wouldn’t be the first person to violate tax law in this way. “It’s not unheard of for people to use their private foundations for their own benefit. Usually if the IRS learns about it, the insider has to pay a penalty tax and repay foundation with interest,” Mayer said. It can be a civil action or a criminal violation, but Mayer has “never heard of anyone serving prison time for this kind of thing.” “Here the foundation allegedly paid for a substantial benefit to Trump’s business — the dropping of lawsuits. That is clearly crossing the line. It’s not even close,” he said.  The Trump Foundation takes in substantial donations from people and organizations, including until eight years ago Trump himself. In 2007, tax forms show that the charity had revenue of close to $4.1 million, from contributions, gifts and grants. Of that total, Trump donated $35,000. Similarly, in 2008, Trump gave $30,000 to the foundation. In previous years, his contributions were bigger, ranging from $184,000 to $713,000. Trump made no donations to his foundation from 2009 to 2014, which is the last year for which records are available. A few years after the Mar-a-Lago settlement, the foundation reportedly paid $158,000 to settle a lawsuit against one of Trump’s golf courses in New York, which led to a charitable donation by the foundation. The foundation is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office over a payment made to a political group associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump supporter who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer. A person familiar with the probe tells ABC News that the New York Attorney General’s Office is also investigating all the donations mentioned in the Post report. The Clinton campaign’s Reynolds said in her statement, “Once again, Trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the rules don’t apply to him. It’s past time for him to release his tax returns to show whether his tax issues extend to his own personal finances.” ABC News’ Liz Kreutz contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1191,"Donald Trump won’t be winging his debate performance Monday, but the Republican presidential nominee also hasn’t been cramming his head with microchips and binders like Hillary Clinton, his campaign manager said Friday. “Of course not. He need not wing it,” Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told Fox Business. “There’s a difference between being spontaneous and just, you know, being yourself at the debate stage.” Story Continued Below Trump and Clinton will square off Monday in New York at Hofstra University for the first presidential debate. While Clinton has taken time off the trail for debate prep, Trump has largely eschewed the traditional debate prep process. His campaign, however, maintains that the real estate mogul will be prepared for Monday's bout. “I don’t think he’s locked up in a cabin for two weeks like other people have been — or currently are — cramming their heads with microchips and binders, but he’s a brilliant man,” Conway said, taking an obvious shot at Clinton’s preparation. Conway said no one is playing Clinton in mock debate sessions because “we all know Hillary Clinton very well, so those of us who are intimately involved with this process feel confident that we understand Hillary Clinton’s record, we understand her vision — her lack thereof — for the country.” Clinton’s performance at NBC’s commander in chief forum earlier this month “wasn’t her best night,” Conway continued, adding that it was “a very typical debate performance or forum performance for Hillary Clinton.” “She’s easily flummoxed,” Conway said. “She did not see Bernie Sanders coming in the primaries this year, she did not do well in debates against Barack Obama in 2008, and she never saw — she never anticipated our comeback in the last five weeks.” Conway also blasted Clinton for asking supporters this week why she isn’t leading Trump by 50 points. Her remark was “a very honest moment” for Clinton but appeared “a little bit desperate,” said Conway, who went on to ask, “Who in the world tells people, ‘Why am I not 50 points ahead of Donald Trump?’” “She cannot believe — it’s so beneath her to be running against Donald Trump for president of the United States. She simply can’t get him out of her mind,” Conway said. “Why is every subject and predicate out of her mouth ‘Donald Trump’? So, you know, that’s the person you’re going to see in the debates, someone who very much has her head occupied by him.”",1,0,0

393,"Washington (CNN)A spokesman for the State Department acknowledged in a recent interview there's ""potential"" for ISIS terrorists to infiltrate refugee camps in the Middle East, but stood by the rigor of US vetting standards for refugees. ""I wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves,"" John Kirby said on ""Fox and Friends"" Wednesday. ""And we've seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey where they'll try to insert themselves into the population."" The acknowledgment comes amid criticism the Obama administration's refugee resettlement policy poses security risks to the US, a charge made often by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the campaign trail. ""Is it perfect?"" Kirby asked of the vetting process. ""Can it be perfect? Can it be foolproof? Well, probably not. No. But it is very, very serious."" ""I can tell you that the vetting is tough,"" he added. ""It is very, very stringent."" Kirby's statement also comes as the State Department is preparing to set new resettlement goals for 2017.

300,"United Nations (CNN)President Barack Obama took to the most prominent international stage Tuesday to deliver a stark warning to American voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in November. Never mentioning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name, the President's final address to the United Nations General Assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the GOP candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. He painted a dark picture of the future awaiting Americans, and the world, if the forces of ""aggressive nationalism"" or ""crude populism"" win out. And he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of Trump's proposal on border security. ""A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama declared to the assembled representatives of the UN's member states. Gone were Obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous UN addresses. The ""hope and change"" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. ""Time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate,"" Obama suggested. ""We have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war,"" Obama said. ""Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history."" He pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created ""an uncertainty and unease and strife"" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. ""I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,"" Obama said. ""We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back."" It was Obama's eighth and final address to the UN body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor George W. Bush. In his speech that year, Obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. But in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for Obama and the UN. The organization's inability to stem suffering in Syria and Ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while Obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. Obama's address Tuesday reflected those realities. He drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged General Assembly hall when he noted that ""at times both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington. And perhaps too many in Washington believe that, as well."" He made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. ""The world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife,"" Obama said. ""Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface."" RELATED: Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons Obama continued his tradition at the UN of acknowledging areas where the US has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. Citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, Obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. ""Those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. Because both the facts and history is on our side,"" Obama said. ""We better strive harder to set a better example at home."" Obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of US leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. He also cited the deal with Iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with Cuba and Myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. RELATED: Global leaders at UN tackle world's worst to-do list But the array of places where Obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. That includes his inability to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians -- a major topic in his first four UN addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. This year, the President took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. He criticized Israeli settlements, saying the only path to Mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. Palestinians must ""reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel,"" Obama said. But he also said peace won't come until ""Israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land."" Obama plans to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to ""discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,"" according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. Another persisting crisis -- Russia's continued incursion into Ukraine -- also drew Obama's attention Tuesday. ""In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,"" Obama said. ""If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. It may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. Over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure."" Indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. ""There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now,"" he told the assembled leaders. ""And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.""

On September 17,Â an attacker apparently affiliated with ISIS stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnetota. He was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. Fortunately, the victimsâ injuries were not life-threatening â something most would celebrate, but Nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because they didnât bring their guns to a knife-attack. In one of his traditionally hateful Facebook posts, Nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her. Calling the victims âsad soulless & embarrassing,â Nugent mocked them for being âso patheticâ and âhelpless,â remarking that âapparently most Americans like being victimsâ:  Previously, Nugent has attacked âlosersâ who donât carry guns after the mass shooting at Umpqua community College in Oregon last year, blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around. Nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations, but Newsweek reported at the time that the campus wasÂ  a âgun-free zoneâ and that it was âcommon knowledgeâ many students were armed. âDisarmed and helpless is an irresponsible, suicidal choice that will get you killed,â Nugent disgustingly concluded. âDefend yourself.â Victim-blaming is a hallmark of the Right â something we can expect to see more and more of if Donald Trump is elected in November.

1556,"This is just disgraceful. Texas… you can do better than this. A judge took to Facebook to vent her feelings after seeing a police officer named Sgt. Demetrick Pennie sue Black Lives Matter and others for causing disparagement of police and causing racial division. He also charges their actions led to the deaths of five officers in Dallas and others across the country. For that, this judge called him a clueless slave. Others on her Facebook page called him derogatory names and went to town on the officer. One of them was a Texas State Representative, if you can believe it. Sergeant Pennie recently petitioned the federal court to expedite his case due to the incoming threats received. Everything is about race now and cop-hatred. I don’t even recognize my country anymore. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), should be removed from the bench permanently. She is supposed to be non-partisan, unbiased and fair as a judge. She is obviously not. She should be reported to the state bar and held accountable.  From Breitbart: A Texas judge likened a black Dallas Police Sergeant to a clueless slave in response to the cop’s lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and its high-profile supporters. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), told her network of friends on Facebook Saturday that Sgt. Demetrick Pennie was like a slave that Harriet Tubman could not free because he could not comprehend his own bondage. The post elicited a number of supporters to Judge Martin’s sentiment, typically calling Pennie a “coon” and other derisive messages. A sitting Texas State Representative apparently joined the racialist banter as well.  Martin’s thoughts led others to compare Pennie to a “coon”, “Judas” and Samuel L. Jackson’s house slave character “Stephen” in the 2012 film, Django Unchained. The derisive comments were repeatedly cheered by Martin’s lines of “laughing-so-hard-I’m-crying” emojis and others.     Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D – Dallas, Mesquite) also appears to join in with a “Stephen” reference via his Facebook account. Judge Martin currently serves in the 304th Juvenile District Court. She originally graduated from Texas Wesleyan University School of Law in 2000 and later worked for the Dallas County District Attorney as a general prosecutor and subsequently represented Child Protective Services. Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D – Dallas, Mesquite) should be recalled immediately as well. Such behavior is unbecoming of a state leader. These people are stone cold racists and they are pushing bigotry and hate. These are the sentiments and comments that tear communities apart. They are extremely destructive. All elected officeholders should be held accountable for their racially-derogatory language.  ",0,0,1
19,"A 19-year-old U.S. Marine shot in the head while on weekend leave in Los Angeles has died and police are searching for suspects, authorities said Tuesday. Lance Cpl. Carlos Segovia Lopez died at a hospital Monday night, according to coroner's spokesman John Cades. The young Marine had been on life support since he was found Friday night slumped over in the driver's seat of his car in South Los Angeles. No suspects were identified and investigators did not have a motive. Officials named the victim as Carlos Segovia Lopez, but a family friend, Claudia Perez, referred to him as Carlos Segovia. ""We ask everyone to please keep his family and Carlos in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,"" Perez posted to Facebook on Tuesday morning. Perez told the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/2cCJbf0) that the Marine was visiting family and friends while on leave from Camp Pendleton near San Diego. The Marine had spent time with his girlfriend and was on his way to Perez's home, where he usually stays while in Los Angeles, when he was struck by gunfire, she said. A vehicle pulled up beside the Marine's car, and at least one person opened fire, striking him once in the head, LAPD Officer Norma Eisenman said Monday. He was not in uniform. Police contacted the U.S. Marine Corps, which in turn notified his family. He was born in El Salvador and came to the U.S. with his mother. Both are U.S. citizens, Perez said. He joined the Marines about six months ago. ""The overwhelming support and prayers we witnessed in support of this young man are a testament to the mighty son, friend and warrior that he was,"" the Marine Corps said in a statement. It went on to say his ""unselfish and honorable legacy will live on in our Corps. Once a Marine, always a Marine.""",1,0,0
22,"The suspect in a spate of bombings that terrorized the New York City metropolitan area this weekend visited a city in Pakistan known for being a hotbed of insurgent activity, a source told ABC News. The suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. Rahami spent time in Quetta, Pakistan, and Afghanistan during a trip, from April 2013 to March 2014, the source said.     Quetta, a city of about 2 million people, is a known hotspot for insurgents and the reported home of the leadership of the Afghan Taliban. ""If they spent more than a few days, it raises suspicions that while they were there, they will have been recruited by terrorist groups,"" national security consultant Richard Clarke said on ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" Monday, referring to Rahami's travel to the area. A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, told ABC News that there was no link between the Taliban and Rahami.   Afghan and U.S. government officials say they believe Quetta has sheltered the Afghan Taliban's leaders since the U.S. invasion forced them to flee the country in 2002. The Taliban's central leadership council, believed to be based there, is known as the Quetta Shura. Officials say leaders there have planned and directed attacks across the border in Afghanistan and coordinated with terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. The area has a major border crossing that leads to Kandahar in Afghanistan and is reported to be a transit point for extremists traveling in and out of Afghanistan and a hub for illegal trade crossing the porous and largely unsecured border.   Several al-Qaeda militants have been killed or captured in the area, and the United States last year destroyed an al-Qaeda base across the border in Kandahar province that U.S. officials said was the largest militant training camp discovered in the history of the Afghanistan war. Quetta harbors a long-simmering insurgency against the Pakistani government. The city has seen a number of significant violent attacks and bombings, most recently last month, when a blast killed more than 70 people and injured over 100 others. In May of this year, a U.S. airstrike in Baluchistan province, which encompasses Quetta, killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. The Pentagon said in a 2014 report that as long as Afghan Taliban forces enjoy “sanctuary” in Quetta and in neighboring border areas of western Pakistan, the Afghan insurgency will persist. Rahami, who was captured Monday after a shootout with police, is being held on charges of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.",1,0,0

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail. Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad. He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

601,"In the past 3 or 4 days, the old Obama “Birther Claims” are again making headlines. This time is that candidate Donald Trump is attempting to close the door on it by saying that Barack Benito Milhous Hussein Obama (ht: Mark Levin) was born in the United States – period. You know it – the claim that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore not eligible to be president – the claim that was first implicitly floated by the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2007 and 2008. Yes, that one. It wasn’t Donald Trump who originally fired up the birther train. He just took it to ridiculous heights. It was actually a political stunt by Hillary Clinton’s chief strategist Mark Penn who wrote in 2007: “His [Obama] roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values.” Penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this. “Every speech should contain the line that you [Hillary] were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century,” he advised Clinton. “And talk about the basic bargain as about [sic] the deeply American values you grew up with, learned as a child, and that drive you today.” He went on: “Let’s explicitly own ‘American’ in our programs, the speeches and the values. He doesn’t … Let’s add flag symbols to the backgrounds [of campaign events].” So they’ve chosen the one straw man they can go to war against. A topic so utterly pointless at this time, the only question to be asked is – what is the point? Almost eight years into Obama’s reign and it’s being brought up again.

741,"The National Association of Secretaries of State have told Congress to step back and let them handle it. They assure Congress that the election mechanism is secure. The data breaches have been about voter databases and NOT the election machines. The polling system is a closed system and not open to hacking. To date there have been zero occurrences.  As Written By Reid Wilson for The Hill: State officials are reassuring members of Congress that the integrity of November’s elections is secure amid growing concerns over cyberattacks by foreign actors tied to Russia. In an open letter to Congress, the National Association of Secretaries of State warns against damaging public confidence in the electoral process. The group, made up of bipartisan election administrators across the nation, says security measures currently in place are sufficient to guarantee an accurate vote count. Vote-counting systems “have their own fail-safes and contingency solutions that would make it highly difficult to leverage them for changing outcomes,” the association said. “Poll books, printed records, back-ups and back-ups of back-ups all provide multiple layers of security around this part of the process.” The association said there is no fix-all to guard against all cyberattacks but pointed out that recent hacks of voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois are unconnected to separate systems that tally votes. The decentralized nature of American election administration acts as its own safeguard, the association said. In November, Americans will vote at hundreds of thousands of polling locations, and those votes are counted by more than 9,000 election administrators, making large-scale hacking almost impossible, it added.

1363,"As he made clear once again in Monday night’s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms—when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was “one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.” Hillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once—as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton’s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. ‘I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,” she said. “Incomes went up for everybody.” Story Continued Below That is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. “My whole life is about winning. … I always win,” Trump says in explaining why he’s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric “Winning the Global Competition.” You don’t get more zero-sum than that. Despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game—but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone’s welfare at once–Trump’s message has resonated in an era when it’s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow. The recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim. Hence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they’ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn’t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton. No, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of “winners” without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan’s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier. Hillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description – clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially – support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins. *** Is either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children’s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing. The voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it’s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders’ powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a “cross of gold.” Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all. Trump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven’t lack for economic benefits in today’s world. They aren’t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street. We have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have.

1384,"When Chesapeake School Board Chairwoman Christie New Craig shared a provocative political cartoon to her personal Facebook page last month, Muslims in her state of Virginia immediately used it as an opportunity to complain about racism, discrimination and Islamophobia. “Muslims hate pork, beer, dogs, bikinis, Jesus, and freedom of speech,” the cartoon read. “My question is, what the hell do they come to America for?!” When questioned by reporters at The Virginian-Pilot, Craig maintained that she did not share the cartoon “maliciously.” “I merely shared it,” she told WAVY-TV. “I did not make a comment, and I’m just shocked with everything going on in our country — police officers are losing their lives, people are homeless and people don’t have jobs — that a political cartoon would cause this much stir.” And yet it created so much controversy that the Council on American-Islamic Relations accused Craig of propagating “anti-Muslim bigotry” and demanded that school board members investigate her post. “Only by addressing this issue can the board uphold its stated commitment ‘to the principle of equal opportunity for all and does not permit discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, military or veteran status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law,'” the council wrote.  Furthermore, M’hammed Abdous, president of the Muslim Community of Tidewater, questioned the accuracy of the cartoon and asked Craig to apologize for sharing it. Craig did eventually apologize, though she made it abundantly clear that this was the furthest she was willing to go — that she would not resign. Craig clearly never once discriminated against anyone. She simply shared a political cartoon or meme on her private Facebook account. Judging by the way local Muslims responded to her innocuous post, however, it is clear that the cartoon was 100 percent right about one thing: Muslims really do hate freedom of speech. H/T Mad World News Do you find it ironic that the Muslims complaining about this cartoon are inadvertently proving that the cartoon is right?

725,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available. [Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group] As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election. A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud. The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America. Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible. Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed. Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

1448,"Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns. That has been made clear as she has never shied away from shilling for gun control. But the National Rifle Association isn’t going to let her get away with it without a fight. They’ve already released a good number of brutal ads targeting Hillary, but the newest one points out how, if Hillary is elected, she will do everything she can to leave you defenseless.   Hillary, and her liberal anti-gun followers, will of course try to claim that all they want is “common sense” gun reform. But what Hillary wants isn’t just some kind of mild gun reform, like requiring a background check before someone can purchase a gun. She wants things like a 25% tax on guns and refuses to say that she believes that the Second Amendment is constitutional. She even praised the Australian gun buyback program, where Australian citizens had their guns confiscated by the government. Of course, Hillary doesn’t hate all guns. She just doesn’t want Americans to be armed. She has armed security guards protecting her every single day, so she doesn’t have to worry about potentially defending herself in a life-or-death situation. She also doesn’t care if you ever need to defend yourself. She’s safe and that’s all that matters. She wants to force you to rely on the government for protection.   That’s why the NRA’s new ad works. People don’t want to be defenseless. Police officers are fantastic and they risk their lives every day to protect Americans… but they can’t be everywhere at once. If someone is in danger, it will take police a few minutes to get there. And without guns, there is literally nothing they can do to defend themselves. Hillary’s plan actually does leave Americans defenseless. Worst of all, gun control doesn’t work. Look at Chicago, with their super strict gun control laws. They still have some of the highest gun violence numbers in the country. Australia still has problems with gun violence, particularly with gangs and drug dealers, despite forcibly confiscating people’s guns. Gun control doesn’t work. And that’s why liberals like Hillary have to lie and use fear to force their agenda into action. The only question is, will Americans fall for it? ",0,0,1
125,"The 2016 election is shaping up to be the weirdest (and nightmarish) election in decades. Up is down, night is day, and stupid is smart. Once Donald Trump became the nominee of a major party for the presidency, all existing and established norms went up in smoke. And the crazy is just getting started, so make sure you’ve got your passport handy. Politico writes that Former President George H.W. Bush is completely snubbing Donald Trump and plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. This revelation came from Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy announced the news on Facebook yesterday when she posted a picture  shaking hands next to Bush Sr with this caption: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!” This is actually not very shocking when you consider how much the Bushes have shown their contempt for Trump, after ruining their chances of continuing their political dynasty with low-energy Jeb. Neither George Bush Sr. or George W. Bush showed up at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and Jeb Bush has constantly let it be known that he has absolutely no intentions of voting for Trump. So perhaps this can be viewed as more of a repudiation of Trump than a glowing endorsement of Hillary. Former First Lady Laura Bush dropped a major bombshell in April of this year when she essentially indicated that she was supporting Hillary. Here’s what Laura Bush about the presidential race: “I want our next president – whoever he or she might be – to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue US policies… that we continue to do what we’re committed to do as a country,” she said, as she appeared on stage alongside her twin daughters Jenna and Barbara. “That’s who I want – or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history, and know what’s what’s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.” Say what you will about George W. Bush–and there’s plenty–but his father was mostly a man of principle who put the country above petty politics. This is yet another reminder of how fractured the Republican Party has become.

337,"Cleveland Heights, Ohio (CNN)Donald Trump said Wednesday he was ""very troubled"" by the fatal police shooting late last week in Oklahoma of an unarmed black man and suggested the officer in question ""got scared"" or was ""choking."" Trump offered his first public reaction to the shooting during an event at the church of Pastor Darrell Scott, a black supporter who asked Trump for his reaction to the police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump began his response by praising police and noting he has been endorsed by several law enforcement groups, but added that ""you always have problems."" ""You have somebody in there that always makes a mistake, that's bad or that chokes,"" Trump said, using a term he often uses to describe somebody who falters under pressure. RELATED: Tulsa police shooting investigated by Justice Department Trump did not address Tuesday's shooting in Charlotte of Keith Lamont Scott, who police say was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but the Republican nominee did describe the video of the shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa. Crutcher was unarmed when he was shot by a police officer. ""I must tell you, I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. To me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do,"" Trump said. ""And he looked like a really good man -- and maybe I'm a little clouded because I saw his family talking about him after the fact ... but he looked like somebody who was doing what they were asking him to do."" ""This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very, very troubled by that and we have to be very careful,"" Trump said, referring to the officer who fatally shot Crutcher. The officer, Betty Shelby, is 42 years old. Trump questioned whether Shelby got ""scared"" or if she was ""choking."" ""Did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But people that choke, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing,"" he said. Trump's remarks on the shooting came as he delivered a speech to a group of pastors focused on his plans to help minority communities as president and one day after he argued that African-American communities are ""in the absolutely worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."" RELATED: Obama: Would be 'personal insult' to legacy if black voters don't back Clinton Trump did not address the Tulsa shooting during the two rallies he hosted on Tuesday, after the Department of Justice announced it would investigate the shooting for possible civil rights violations.

Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash, who then asked what he would have said. ""Maybe I'll tell you at the next debate. We'll see. But I'm very happy,"" Trump said. He added: ""I think she'd be a poor president. I don't think she'd be do the job. We need somebody who will really be able to do the job. She doesn't have what it takes to make America great again."" ""I think it went better than I ever thought,"" he said. Trump later said in another interview after the debate that Clinton never gets anything ""fixed."" ""She has been saying these things for years. And nothing ever happens. They never get fixed.

1575,"I just could not stomach that debate last night. In the first ten minutes, I heard nothing but horrific socialist drivel from Hillary Clinton. Then Trump immediately chimed in with protectionism and tariffs. Both want socialist policies. It’s just stomach churning. Trump says he’ll release his tax returns if Clinton releases her deleted emails. We’ll never see either one. Both candidates say they are for taking Second Amendment rights from those on the No-Fly list which is heavily flawed and the whole concept is unconstitutional. However, the issue of ISIS was blood boiling. Trump screwed up big time: “No wonder you have been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” he told Clinton. ISIS came into being around 2003 after the Iraq War. Unless she’s 13 years-old, that was just flat wrong. But even worse was Hillary’s faux paux where she blustered: “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Exactly backwards and SEAL Team Six member Robert O’Neill called her on it.  From Independent Journal Review: During the debate on Monday night, Hillary weighed in on how we need to take down ISIS. She said we need to: “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Veteran and SEAL Team Six member Robert O’Neill, who was part of the mission to kill Bin Laden, found something off about her comments. So he called her out for it:  We should wipe out ISIS everywhere, but especially in Syria where they are headquartered. They are spreading into Iraq, not the other way around. Clinton also seemed to intimate that she took out bin Laden. O’Neill shot him with the backup of his SEAL team… Clinton and Obama merely watched and had almost nothing to do with it. Lester Holt was a disgrace too. Not only did he not bring up Benghazi or the emails, he let both candidates blather on issues where they got multiple points wrong. It was a waste of a debate. Trump let Hillary slide on most issues. Both gave the same old talking points. One of them will be president and I guess we certainly get what we deserve in that department. We’ve richly earned it and begged for it. Don’t even get me started on Ted Cruz fawning over Trump’s lackluster performance last night. It’s disillusioning in the extreme. Cruz made that bed though and now he’s lying in it. I agree with SooperMexican: “There are no more heroes, there is only booze.” Looks like it’s going to be a predictable, boring apocalypse.

1154,"Donald Trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too. Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies. Story Continued Below It’s standard practice for the agency — which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials — to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates. In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle. The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him. The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest. “The taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities."" Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying “everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.” Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC “specifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seats” on charter aircraft. A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trump’s campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower. But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc. Trump, who once said “I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,” has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets. The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as “misleading and flat out wrong,” pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign. The statement explained the campaign’s payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying “the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.” The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission. ""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses."" The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So it’s conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane. The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly. The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund. Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trump’s campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.",1,0,0

LeAnn Rimes life looks pretty perfect if you take a glance at her success or her social media accounts, but the truth is that it isn’t always roses and rainbows for the country star. In fact, it hasn’t been that way at all for her. Even now after getting ready for her new album release she has shared some of the most intimate secrets that none of us knew about. She has been through a lot over the years, and of course all of it was extremely public which didn’t make it any easier.  In an interview with Hello! magazine she opened up about all of the hardships she has been over the past couple of years and it broke our hearts. One thing you may not know is that she took her former manager and her father into court for stealing money from her. It was already hard enough for LeAnn having all of the pressure from the public, but when her father betrayed her it was a harder pill to swallow. That wasn’t all that she has been through though. After her divorce with Dean Sheremet she ended up checking herself into rehab for depression.  The country star had an affair on her husband with her now current husband Dean Sheremet and it was one of the most publicized scandals in music at the time. She has struggled with all of these circumstances over the past years and she quit making new music. Now the country star is ready to come out with her new album “Remnant” and she opened up about how all of these life events have made her into the woman she is today. She says that this record isn’t going to be like any other. This album is going to be her “tell-all”. She is going to walk her fans through the past ten years of her life and how it has all helped her grow as a person – it is the most vulnerable album of hers to date. “This is a powerful record for me. I’m in my 30s now and whether it’s in your 30s or at some other point in your life, everyone will go through a kind of crumbling of sorts and for me it was about trying to do that as gracefully as possible…There is a real beauty in allowing that to happen as you get to pick up the piece and rebuild them to find out who you really are. Starting in the music industry so young, there were so many influences that weren’t truly me, but this album comes from the inside out.”  She added that many women will be able to relate to it, and she is excited for the release. “I know I’m not the only one that’s been through heartache and that so many women can relate to it. The last album was coming from chaos and this one if coming from love. I feel very settled now…”  We are so proud of LeAnn! So many women will be able to relate to this!",0,0,1
593,"One question on the mind of many is why would the Clinton IT staff plead the 5th? Based on this report from the NY Post, we may have part of our answer: The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into Clinton’s server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on Clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct‐-Feb? . . . If we had that e-mail, we are golden,” Platte River IT consultant Bill Thornton wrote to colleagues on Aug. 19, 2015. “Wondering how we can sneak an e-mail in now after the fact asking them when they told us to cut the backups and have them confirm it for our records. Starting to think this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy s- -t.” Thornton and fellow Platte River specialist Paul Combetta refused to answer questions last week before a congressional committee probing the server scandal. Each cited his Fifth Amendment rights. Recently Judicial Watch submitted questions to Hillary Clinton that a federal judge required her to answer. That may be why crooked Hillary almost passed out on 9-11, since the date looms. Perhaps we will finally get real answers to the racketeering of The Clinton Mafia. ",0,0,1
1597,"Progressive Democrats are the “helicopter parents” of America. They want to protect people so much that they end up doing more harm than good, and it’s keeping segments of the American population from being fully independent. This is NOT what our Founders envisioned when they set out to create our government.  One of the groups most negatively affected by liberal hand-holding is blacks. Don’t believe me? Just ask Thomas Sowell, who penned an amazing piece for National Review on this very subject. Back in the 1960s, as large numbers of black students were entering a certain Ivy League university for the first time, someone asked a chemistry professor — off the record — what his response to them was. He said, “I give them all A’s and B’s. To hell with them.” Since many of those students were admitted with lower academic qualifications than other students, he knew that honest grades in a tough subject like chemistry could lead to lots of failing grades, and that in turn would lead to lots of time-wasting hassles — not just from the students, but also from the administration. He was not about to waste time that he wanted to invest in his professional work in chemistry and the advancement of his own career. He also knew that his “favor” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in the long run, because they wouldn’t know what they were supposed to know. Such cynical calculations were seldom expressed in so many words. Nor are similar cynical calculations openly expressed today in politics. But many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks “favors” that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run. Sowell continues his piece, lamenting the creation and maintenance of the “welfare state,” a term used to describe a government that acts as a parent of the citizen. In 1960, before this expansion of the welfare state, 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent. By 1985, 67 percent of black children were raised with either one parent or no parent. A big “favor” the Obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining of other categories of students.

438,"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton called Friday for officials in Charlotte, North Carolina, to make public a police video showing the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. The shooting of Scott, a black man, has sparked protests in the city this week and is the latest incident to fuel a national discussion about lethal police force, particularly against African-Americans. ""Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides. --H,"" Clinton said in a tweet, the ""H"" indicating that she personally approved the message. Clinton will travel Charlotte on Sunday, according to her campaign spokesman, Nick Merrill. Details will be forthcoming, he said. Two police videos -- from a dashboard camera and an officer's body camera -- show how Scott died. Police allowed Scott's family to view the videos Wednesday but have so far declined to release the footage to the public. Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violence On Friday, Scott's family released what it says is a separate cell phone video, recorded by his wife, that shows the moments leading up to his fatal shooting. Clinton calls shootings 'intolerable' Clinton has commented throughout the week on the shootings of Scott and and Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man who was killed by police last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At a campaign event on Wednesday, Clinton said that the police killings of Scott and Crutcher are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable."" ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, told CNN's ""New Day"" this week that as president, Clinton would prevent such shootings by building ""bonds between communities and law enforcement."" Clinton's Republican rival, Donald Trump, has not yet publicly commented on Scott's death. Speaking about the Tulsa shooting, however, he said he was ""very troubled"" by the incident and suggested the officer -- who has since been charged with manslaughter -- ""got scared"" or was ""choking,"" slang for a person who fails under pressure. Family releases cell phone video Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Friday he expected police videos of the shooting to be released eventually, when investigators decide that it can be released as part of a package with other information, so that the videos aren't released without context. This differed from his message a day earlier, when he said the public shouldn't expect the videos' release. Scott's family on Friday released cell phone video, recorded by his wife, that shows the moments leading to his fatal shooting by police Tuesday. ""Don't shoot him. He has no weapon,"" Rakeyia Scott can be heard saying. The first portions of the shaky video appear to show a number of police officers surround a vehicle in a parking lot.

""He's not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine."" Police said an officer shot Scott after he failed to heed commands to drop a gun. His family has said he didn't have a gun.

The attackers implicated in those incidents were both admitted to the United States as children. Pence didn’t say how tougher vetting would have helped prevent those attacks, but he said: “We need common sense back in our immigration policies.” Pence also referenced a Turkish immigrant implicated in a Friday shooting north of Seattle that left five dead as he made his call for changes in immigration policy. “We don’t know the motivation of the permanent legal resident in Washington state who took five American lives last night,” he said.",1,0,0
1554,"As most of our readers are well aware, there has been immense speculation recently regarding the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

""Getting ready, getting ready!"" pic.twitter.com/mXxBbMiVcu — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) September 25, 2016  As can be seen in the video, Clinton seemingly ignored the reporter’s first questions, instead remaining intently focused on grabbing the handrail and her footing on the steps as she descended. Once she was about three-quarters of the way down the stairs, only then did Clinton turn her attention to the reporter, flashing a sudden smile but continuing to ignore the questions, replying with only “Getting ready” when pressed about her preparedness for the first presidential debate Monday evening. She then carefully hoisted herself up into her special campaign van, without any assistance, though a Secret Service agent stood ready to perhaps lend a hand right behind her. While it is entirely plausible that Clinton didn’t see or hear the reporter until she had reached the bottom of the steps, this video clip will likely still serve as further proof that she is suffering from some sort of medical issues that make it difficult for her to walk up and down stairs. The video certainly reinforces the supposition that Clinton suffers from selective hearing, picking and choosing which questions she will acknowledge and answer while ignoring others that may prove difficult or too revealing for her. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see Hillary Clinton seemingly struggle in her effort to successfully descend a flight of stairs, so much so that she virtually ignored a reporter standing and watching in close proximity.

307,"Kenansville, North Carolina (CNN)Donald Trump bragged Tuesday there's ""nothing like"" using other people's money, hours after a report said he used more than $250,000 from his charitable organization to litigate lawsuits against his business interests. Trump, while calling for building safe zones in Syria financed by Gulf states, vaunted the benefits of doing business with ""OPM."" ""It's called OPM. I do it all the time in business. It's called other people's money,"" Trump said. ""There's nothing like doing things with other people's money because it takes the risk -- you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk."" His comments came on the heels of a Washington Post report published earlier Tuesday, which called attention to Trump's funneling of contributions from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to charities in order to settle lawsuits against Trump. Trump has only sparsely contributed to his foundation. Instead, the foundation is largely funded by outside donors -- not Trump himself. Trump did not make those comments in the context of that report on Tuesday. The Republican presidential nominee has frequently lauded the benefits of ""OPM,"" telling his supporters at rallies that he would put the tactic to use for the country's benefit. Trump has frequently called for other countries to chip in larger amounts to help pay for the US military to maintain its bases around the world, in addition to calling for Gulf states like Saudi Arabia to bear a larger financial burden in the fight against ISIS and in building a safe zone to shelter refugees. Trump has called for building a safe zone at the same time as he has stiffly argued against allowing any more Syrian refugees into the US. Even though refugees undergo numerous screenings and a lengthy vetting process that can take more than a year, Trump has argued they could represent a national security threat to the United States.

Now it’s all ‘agenda politics’ and rushing for the scoop… even if it’s WRONG. ClashDaily asked the question. (Isn’t ‘Hispanic’ more of a liguistic term?) With social media, the revolt is well underway: A controversy began brewing Friday night when Mount Vernon police described the suspect in the Cascade Mall shooting as a Hispanic male in his late teens to mid-20s with a close-shaved haircut. By Saturday night, when police arrested Turkish immigrant Arcan Cetin in connection with the crime, it had reached a full boil on Twitter. Some observers were angry that police had wrongly put out the word to look for someone who was Hispanic and that many media outlets — including The Seattle Times — repeated the description. Laura Martínez tweeted, “BREAKING: Cable networks realize ‘brown mall shooting suspect’ is not Hispanic after all.” Others suggested that officials and the media were trying to cover up the possibility of terrorism inspired by or sympathetic to ISIS.

Asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he'd be willing to campaign for Trump or help with his debate prep, the former Trump nemesis was on board. He formally endorsed the Republican nominee in a Facebook post last Friday. ""I am happy to help. I have conveyed that to them. I will do whatever I can to defeat Hillary Clinton,"" Cruz said, adding that he is equally focused on preserving a Republican majority in the Senate. ""I'm going to do everything I can to urge conservatives to come out and vote, even if they may not be thrilled at the candidates on the ballot.

Trump's former rival praised his ""strong"" debate performance, calling Clinton ""tired"" and ""formulaic."" ""I thought it was a very strong debate. I thought Hillary did not have a good performance. I think throughout the night, she was tired, she was formulaic. The entire debate from Hillary was more Washington as usual.

1333,"Hillary Clinton will be at the next debate in St. Louis and the one after that in Las Vegas, regardless of whether Donald Trump decides to show up, she maintained Tuesday. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a top Trump surrogate, suggested that the Republican presidential nominee forgo the remaining presidential debates unless he’s assured by the moderators that they will “act like a journalist and not an incorrect, ignorant fact-checker.” Story Continued Below “Well, I’m gonna show up,” Clinton told reporters Tuesday during a gaggle aboard her campaign plane in White Plains, New York. “He gets to decide what he’s gonna do, but I will be there at Wash U in St. Louis and then after that in Las Vegas. If I’m the only person on stage, well, you know, I’m the only person on stage.” The next presidential debate is Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis, followed by an Oct. 19 debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump skipped two debates during the Republican primary — once to hold a competing fundraiser for veterans organizations and again because he was due to speak at a conference of the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC (the latter debate was ultimately canceled after Trump and John Kasich pulled out). “Nobody told me about debates. As you saw, I thought the last debate on CNN was the last debate,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” at the time, though following that CNN debate he had told Chris Cuomo that he’s “had enough” of the debates after noting “they want to do two more.”",1,0,0
284,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this."" RELATED: Charlotte police shoot and kill man, sparking growing protest ""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards."" Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer. Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. ""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said. Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America. ""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

1372,"With yet two bombings and stabbings being committed within a 12-hour span, America has been reminded that we are the target of both homegrown hatred and the fanatical cult-like fallowing of a medieval ‘religion’. As expected, the two candidates running for office gave their comments on the matter..  But it was only one that really caught the attention of the media and not for what was said, but rather how it was delivered. Hillary Clinton used her response to a New York City bombing Saturday night to yet again take a swing at Donald Trump, but opponents and the media wondered if she was swinging while she was under the influence of something else. A tranquilized-sounding Clinton looked as if she was dazed out of her mind, as well as looking as if she was about to drop over and fall asleep. She spoke with the media pool that have been following her around on the campaign: “I’ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, I’ll have more to say about it when we actually know some facts.” As she was giving her take, a reporter asked about Donald Trump’s reply and if she had any further comment on it. “I think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this. That’s why it’s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen. I think it’s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened,” she said. Twitter has gone crazy over the interview, with many followers saying they believed Clinton was either drugged up, or she just didn’t have the energy to wake herself up in a time of need. Either, or – it’s not Presidential material.  Is she highly medicated or what??

161,"Last night, Fox News reporter Steve Harrigan was reporting live in Charlotte, North Carolina to cover Â police brutality protests that had erupted after a shooting. Perhaps because Fox News has typically shamed these kinds of protests and ran footage that depicted protesters as thugs and looters in the past, Harrigan got his a** handed to him by a protester that didnât hesitate to confront the notoriously racist network. The female African American protester went right up to Harrigan and decided to educate him about why she and other protesters had gathered. When Harrigan tried to shame her for being outside in an area where someone had just gotten shot, the protester couldnât tolerate his ignorance and white privilege anyÂ longer. Harrigan made the mistake of asking her,Â âIf a man was shot about 50 yards over there, we donât know by who. Why are you here?â And that was it. The protester went off, and replied to Harrigan,Â âBecause I serve a purposeâ right before giving him a brutal lesson in racism. She forcefully said that no matter where she is, at any given moment she could be shot just because of the color of her skin. She said: âI could be at work, at school, in my car, I can still get shot â by the police!â Pointing out the fact that racism still exists in America, she continued: âWe are not the same. We are human, but I am black and you are white so donât tell me not to come over hereâ¦â Harrigan tried to jump in, but the protester quickly called him out for âusing sarcasmâÂ as a crowd began to gather, and accused the network of only being at the protests so that they could get video footage andÂ âmake a f*cking fabricated storyâ â which we all know Fox News has done in the past.

665,"“I really support everything President Obama said he would do through regulation on guns but we’re going to start the very first day and tackle the gun lobby.” – Hillary Clinton on MSNBC, 4/25/16 There are those who believe that the 2016 presidential election is a once in a generation, existential kind of national election. These folks notice all of the dangers we face and worry that depending on how the vote falls this November, we may soon be a very different nation than we’ve been. I’m not sure I fit on this worrisome boat, but I do believe that our dearest rights and freedoms are in danger today. The Left has developed a fascist streak unlike any we’ve seen previously in American history, and they believe it to be their duty to destroy our liberty… for our own good, of course. “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.” – Hillary Clinton, The Free Beacon, 10/1/15 Into this caustic climate comes the NRA, an organization wholly devoted to defending the 2nd Amendment from the gun-grabbing left. The NRA believes that if elected president, Hillary Clinton would do everything in her power to undermine and repeal the 2nd Amendment. Because of this, they are working hard to unmask her as the anti-freedom fascist she really is. Their latest ad paints a disturbing picture, reminding all Americans what is really at stake in the upcoming election.  This is the second in the “Don’t Let Hillary Leave You Defenseless” series. The previous ad covered the disgusting hypocrisy of Clinton’s anti-gun position. Here’s a woman who has lived the last 30+ years of her life surrounded by men with firearms, yet she has the audacity to tell law abiding American citizens that they shouldn’t have the right to use the same tool to defend their families? If it wasn’t such a serious topic, it’d be laughable. “When it comes to guns, we have just too many guns.”— Hillary Clinton, USA Today, 4/20/2016  In November, you can actively defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

902,"In an interview with Rolling Stone, rock legend and American icon Bruce Springsteen ripped Republican nominee Donald Trump for undermining the integrity of our democracy and for unleashing the undercurrents of white supremacy into mainstream American politics. When asked what his thoughts on the Trump phenomenon were, he gave this nuanced and eloquent response: Well, you know, the republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it’s a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you’re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it’s a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don’t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all. The ideas he’s moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas – white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he’s done – not immediately disavowing David Duke? These are things that are obviously beyond the pale for any previous political candidate. It would sink your candidacy immediately. I believe that there’s a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the United States for the past 35, 40 years and how it’s deeply affected people’s lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution. And Trump’s thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing. It is indeed a tragedy for our democracy. The most important part of democratic governance is ensuring the public believes that our politicians are held in check by the will of the people – and the behavior of the Republican Party over the past eight years has been to erode that confidence in our electoral system through their efforts gain unfair advantage by repressing the votes of minorities and gerrymandering districts to ensure their political security. At the same time, their single-minded devotion to increasing the political power of the monied elites and funneling the wealth of the American people to the top 1% has greatly exacerbated the costs of deindustrialization/globalization, while studiously denying the existence of those costs in the first place. Donald Trump is the epitome of that excess, the wealthy man who has spent his entire life exploiting and extorting his way to wealth who has now turned to cheap ethnonationalist scapegoating as a way of shifting the blame for the economic frustrations of the working class off of predatory capitalists like himself and onto minority groups. “The Boss” also gave a resounding endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, saying that he thinks she would be a “a very, very good president.” Springsteen’s words remind us all of what’s at stake in this election, and why it’s so critical that we defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box this November.",0,1,0

The Icelandic foreign ministry said it doesn’t want the retailer to give up its brand, but wants to make sure it does not stand in the way of Icelandic firms that want to register the name “Iceland” in the EU, the Independent reports Friday. A spokesman for the foreign ministry said legal action was “being looked into.” “We are looking for a ‘live and let live’ outcome,” said Jon Asbergsson, managing director of Promote Iceland, an agency linked to the Icelandic foreign ministry. Iceland Foods, which has 800 stores across Britain, has been in business since 1970. “We are not aware that our use of the Iceland name has ever caused any confusion with Iceland the country,” a spokesperson for the chain said. “We didn’t make any objections in the beginning, as we were never going to be running any supermarkets,” Asbergsson said. “But over the course of the years they have been registering the name in several other categories and companies that have Iceland in the name.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

1205,"President Barack Obama hailed the timing of the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Friday, signaling his desire for people of all stripes to visit the new museum and walk away with a better understanding of what it’s like to be black in America. “The timing of this is fascinating,” Obama said during a reception at the White House. The “exceptionally good-looking group” of many friends — so many “that it feels like one of our house parties,” he quipped — applauded in agreement. Story Continued Below “Part of the reason that I am so happy the museum is opening this weekend is because it allows all of us as Americans to put our current circumstances in a historical context,” Obama said. “My hope is that as people are seeing what’s happened in Tulsa or Charlotte on television, and perhaps are less familiar with not only the history of the African-American experience but also how recent some of these challenges have been, upon visiting the museum may step back and say: ‘I understand. I sympathize. I empathize. I can see why folks might feel angry, and I wanna be part of the solution, as opposed to resisting change.’” Obama’s references to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, highlight the most recent officer-involved shootings of black men that have captured the nation’s attention. Officers fatally shot Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands raised when he was struck, in Tulsa last Friday and Keith Lamont Scott, who officers contend was armed when he was struck but concede that video doesn’t conclusively corroborate their account, in Charlotte on Tuesday. Obama, flanked by first lady Michelle Obama and the museum’s director, Lonnie Bunch, used a sampling of letters he said he read on Thursday to illustrate the divide among Americans when it comes to policing and talks of racial bias. “I’d say about half of them said, ‘Mr. President, why are you always against police, and why aren’t you doing enough to deal with these rioters and the violence?’” he said. “And then the other half were some black folks [who] said, ‘Mr. President, why aren’t you doing something about the police, and when are we actually gonna get justice?’ And I understand the nature of that argument because this is a dialogue we’ve been having for 400 years.” A key challenge Obama cited in “generating a constructive discussion about how to solve these problems” is rhetoric on TV and the radio that’s “bereft of context and ignores history.” “So people are just responding as if none of what’s represented in this museum ever happened,” Obama said, “adding, “That’s true for all of us, not just some of us.” “My hope is, is that this, this complicated, difficult, sometimes harrowing but I believe ultimately triumphant story, will help us talk to each other,” he continued. “And more important, listen to each other. And even more important, see each other, and recognize the common humanity that makes America what it is.”",1,0,0

405,"(CNN)The fate of several dead American ISIS hostages quietly came back to the forefront at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday when a member asked Defense Secretary Ash Carter to find a way to bring their bodies home. Sen. Joe Donnelly brought the issue up amid growing talk by military commanders about using Kurdish and Arab forces to push ISIS out of Raqqa, the terror group's stronghold in Syria and self-declared capital. The US believes several of the US hostages murdered by ISIS likely were killed in the Raqqa area and their bodies have never been recovered. ""When we go to Raqqa, we lost some young men and women there who were killed by ISIL, and we want to have them come home, "" said Donnelly, an Indiana Democrat, using another word for ISIS. ""We don't want to leave anyone behind. And we would ask for your cooperation and assistance,"" he said to Carter. Donnelly specifically mentioned Peter Kassig, an aid worker killed in November 2014, and Kayla Mueller, another aid worker ISIS held, tortured and then claimed died in an airstrike. The US believes the American hostages, including journalist James Foley, were killed by the now-dead ISIS operative known as Jihadi John. ""All the parents and all the folks back home, we want them all to come home. And we'd sure appreciate your assistance in making that happen,"" Donnelly said. Carter answered ""noted."" The military is aware of the families' desires, but also knows how very tough that job may be, one defense official told CNN. The US military has a long history of trying to recover the remains of dead Americans. Recently the bodies of two American civilians who fought and were killed with militia groups fighting ISIS were returned to the US. And fallen service members missing on foreign battlefields are still being searched for from the Vietnam and Korean wars, as well as World War II. The US also searched for years in Iraq for the Scott Speicher, a downed Navy pilot from the first Gulf War, until his remains were recovered in 2009. But whether the remains of the hostages can be located, identified and brought home may be very difficult the defense official said. It's widely believed there are a number of burial sites around Raqqa and without some confirmation of where the Americans are buried it may be too sensitive to begin removing remains. ",1,0,0
95,"President Obama painted Donald Trump as unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be commander-in-chief after the first presidential debate. ""Anybody who was watching the debate, I think got a sense that you got really sharply-contrasting visions about where we should take the country. And I’m admittedly biased. I have worked with Hillary. I know her. She is well-prepared. She’s got the right temperament for the job,"" Obama said in an interview with ""On Air With Ryan Seacrest."" He contrasted that with what what he believes Trump has demonstrated. ""The other guy doesn’t have the preparation, the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunity that would take our country forward,"" he said. Obama described why he thinks this election is particularly important and why voters need to turn out. ""Every election is a big election. This one’s especially big just because there’s such big differences between the two candidates, and people need to register to vote,"" he said. ""There's only one candidate in this race -- Hillary Clinton -- who's actually qualified to do the job and make good decisions for us."" The president expressed concern over Trump's stance on two issues he thinks will be pivotal to his daughters' generation --- nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. ""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or North Korea should be protected by us, maybe they should get their own nuclear weapon.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,"" he said. The president added, ""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot of the Chinese, it's a fraud and a hoax when 99 percent of scientists are saying, 'No we've got to do something about this. That worries me.'"" Asked what he thinks when his name is mentioned in a debate, Obama said, ""If I got heated about stuff that was said about me at this point, I would be even more in the grey than I already am. I've developed a pretty thick skin."" ",1,0,0
395,"(CNN)Sen. Tim Scott said Thursday that instituting stop-and-frisk policing -- like the kind Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for -- could be a potential impingement on Constitutional rights, adding that the policy would be ineffective at easing police-community relations. ""The reality of it is that you don't need to violate the Constitution to keep communities safe,"" the Republican South Carolinian told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead."" ""We're seeing an increase, an improvement, in public life, in quality of life in South Carolina because we learned how to work together."" RELATED: Reality Check: Was 'stop-and-frisk' effective? Communities that are at a higher risk of crime would benefit from collaborating directly with law enforcement officials, said Scott, who is the US Senate's sole black Republican. ""We still have issues, we still have challenges, but we're working the right direction,"" Scott said. Trump recently touted the policing practice and has brought up the topic during recent public appearances, adding that stop-and-frisk policies have worked in some cities to lower crime. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,"" Trump said in response to an audience member's question during a pre-taped Fox News town hall. He said the following morning that his comments were in regards to how to stop gun violence in Chicago. In light of recent police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Charlotte, North Carolina, Scott said while relations between law enforcement and community members are increasingly fraught, those who want to see change must partner with police to delineate a clear path for the future. ""Part of the pain and the suffering that happens without clarity is that people jump to conclusions and sometimes it's the wrong conclusion,"" he said. ""The faster the information jumps to the surface, the more information that provides clarity, hopefully the greater the calm will be."" Scott cited how publicizing video footage of police shootings -- as in the case in Oklahoma, as well as following a 2015 fatal police shooting in Scott's home town of North Charleston -- gives communities more clarity about the incidents. ""I'm simply here to suggest that there are some solutions that will provide greater clarity and provide a more panoramic view of the situation,"" he said. ""Body cameras (are) a part of that."" With protests surrounding recent police shootings cropping up around the country -- with some turning violent -- Scott said the most appropriate response would be to forge a path allowing the community to come together with law enforcement to draft key policies. ""There is never a reason for violence in response to the situation,"" Scott told Tapper. ""Violence for violence only begets more violence. This is the wrong direction in the wrong path."" ",1,0,0
118,"Youâve got to love Robert Reich. The former Secretary of Labor under future First Lady and former President Bill Clinton met a Trump supporter at a coffee shop and couldnât resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poor guyâs week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him: facts. âI finally found a Trump supporter â this morning when I went to buy coffee. (I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his car.),â Reich writes in a Facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it Monday morning. Then he completely dismantled Trump â politely â before the guyâs very eyes: âHi,â I said. âNoticed your Trump bumper sticker.â âYup,â he said, a bit defensively. âI hope you donât mind my asking, but Iâm curious. Why are you supporting him?â âI know heâs a little bit much,â said the Trump supporter. âBut heâs a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president.â âHow do you know heâs a successful businessman?â I asked. âBecause heâs made a fortune.â âHas he really?â I asked. âOf course. Forbes magazine says heâs worth four and a half billion.â âThat doesnât mean heâs been a success,â I said. âIn my book it does,â said the Trump supporter. âYou know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,â I said. âMost of that was from his father.â âThat just proves my point,â said the Trump supporter. âHe turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man.â âBut if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, heâd be worth twelve billion today,â I said. The Trump supporter went silent. âAnd he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in New York alone,â I said. More silence. âHeâs not a businessman,âÂ Reich concluded. âHeâs a con man. âHope you enjoy your coffee.â While itâs unlikely that Reich managed to change the Trump fanâs mind â or even reach him on a level that matters â he surely left the guyÂ steaming more than a freshly-brewed cup of go-go- juice.

861,"During a Fox and Friends interview Monday morning to talk about the NYC bombings, Donald Trump came dangerously close to suggesting unheard of levels of censorship. Trump asserted that the the biggest obstacle towards stopping terrorism at home is the first amendment and the lax attitude surrounding freedom of the press. Referring to jihadi propaganda, the Donald said: “They’re all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, it’s called “freedom of the press,” where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw. They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because they’re participating in crime. Instead they say “oh no you can’t do anything, that’s freedom of expression.” Of course, this is wild conjecture. There is no way Donald Trump has absolutely any idea why the New York bomber decided to build these bombs, the information for which is easily found in a cursory Google search, which has nothing to do with how that possibly relates to the print news media’s freedom of expression, which he’s criticized on numerous occasions. The type of publications that would even contain this kind of information – we’re assuming he’s referring to the Daeshi magazine, Dabiq –  are diligently hunted down and taken off the website by counterterror forces. But the most terrifying aspect of this line of thinking, is how casually it could use the “boogeyman of terrorism” to make freedom of speech disposable, setting a dangerous precedent that could be expanded to censor any kind of dissenting opinion. Trump, has long demonstrated his disdain for the press, and has a chilling history that suggests he would be open to embracing unconstitutional censorship. Trump has praised the leadership of Russia, admiring its “strength” despite its history of censorship and human rights abuses including state control of the media and regular murder of dissident journalists. Back in August, he took to Twitter and railed against “the corrupt media” and freedom of the press for having the audacity to look into his personal life and to dig up the skeletons in his closet. Although Trump has never actually revealed what he would do to address this grievance with the press, his comments underscore a grim future ahead for America if he is elected. Trump has taken every opportunity to criticize and attempt to discredit anyone that disagrees with him in any way, leaving behind a trail of journalists and citizens fed up with appalling lack of regard to the First Amendment and the founding principles of our nation. Here’s the full interview with Fox & Friends: ",0,1,0

731,"On Friday, I reported that of those arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, 70% of the provocateurs and rioters were from out of state. However, one writer is now questioning why they are not facing federal charges of crossing state lines in order to engage in rioting and destruction. James Lonstreet writes at The American Thinker that the Department of Justice has a “disinterest for certain laws” and it has engaged in “non-enforcement of the law has become sport in the past eight years.” Lonstreet says that the number of out of state rioters who have been arrested should pique the interest of the DOJ, but it doesn’t. Instead, the Justice Department has become so corrupt that it no longer seeks justice. He writes: Criminals disguised as protestors cross state lines to engage in destruction and rioting.  Has anyone heard of the statute that prohibits crossing state lines to engage in such behavior being enforced by federal authorities? From the Federal Judicial Center, 2101. Riots: (a) (1) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, with intent – (A) to incite a riot; or (B) to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or (C) to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or (D) to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; and who either during the course of any such travel or use or thereafter performs or attempts to perform any other overt act for any purpose specified in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. (b) In any prosecution under this section, proof that a defendant engaged or attempted to engage in one or more of the overt acts described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and (1) has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or (2) has use of or used any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including but not limited to, mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, to communicate with or broadcast to any person or group of persons prior to such overt acts, such travel or use shall be admissible proof to establish that such defendant traveled in or used such facility of interstate or foreign commerce. There is a wisdom to such laws, one that predicts how local situations can blossom into much larger events when interlopers are allowed to exacerbate the situation.  These laws need to be enforced.  They are not.  It is fair to ask, “Why not?” Recall in Ferguson that the influx of non-residents (Revolution Club of Chicago, New Black Panthers, etc.) who came to join in the fray was noted by local authorities, yet there was no action from federal authorities regarding the enforcement of statues prohibiting the crossing of state lines to engage in such behavior. Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. (June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 808; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)” source He then concludes, “There are two clarities. The administration has sympathies in one direction, and the Department of Justice has disinterest in another direction.” This is not the first time that Lonstreet has brought this issue up. In 2014, he wrote on the issue when it was the New Black Panthers stirring up rioting in Ferguson, Missouri. At that time, he cited the same law and wrote, “The proof is for all to see. The New Black Panthers once again are not prosecuted at the choice of federal authorities. (Recall Philadelphia polling incident.) Need we mention who those authorities are?” Picking and choosing which laws to enforce is problematic for sure. This administration not only often targets innocent Americans, but then allows the lawless to escape punishment. Perhaps it’s time the people brought justice upon their criminal representatives in DC and institute new government, as the Declaration of Independence advises us to do.

29,"Concerns about New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami's intentions were raised to authorities by his father and a neighbor more than once over the past years, ABC News has learned. Two years ago, Rahami's father told the FBI that his son was interacting with ""bad people"" overseas and a concerned citizen in the neighborhood told authorities that Rahami's associates may have been trying to procure explosives, sources told ABC News. The FBI first became aware of Rahami in the summer of 2014, when local law enforcement contacted the agency's New Jersey field office about him, sources said. A dispute at the Rahami home had brought local law enforcement to the house at that time. A neighbor told the authorities he overheard Rahami's father calling his son a ""terrorist,"" according to a U.S. official. In addition, the neighbor said Rahami’s father had expressed concern his son may be in contact with people overseas who were collecting explosives, ABC news was told. The FBI then opened a so-called ""Guardian"" file on Rahami, initiating a process to determine whether Rahami had any links to terrorism or other criminal activity and whether a more formal investigation was warranted. The assessment of Rahami produced no clear evidence or indications of radicalization, and at one point his father recanted his claims, sources said. Rahami was not placed on any U.S. terrorism watch lists. Speaking to reporters today outside of his New Jersey home, Rahami's father said he ""called the FBI two years ago"" about his son. ""I told them you got a connection with this guy,"" he said, without offering any further information.   The FBI interviewed Rahami’s father after New Jersey officials compiled complaints and sent them a suspicious activity report. He told the FBI that his son had traveled to Pakistan and was interacting with ""bad people,"" according to sources. Rahami's father also told the FBI his son had injured and beaten members of his immediate family -- but a grand jury declined to file charges against him. However, Rahami's father later told the FBI he didn't mean to suggest his son was a terrorist, but that he was hanging out with ""undesirables,"" the U.S. official said. At a press conference Monday, the head of the FBI's field office in New York, Bill Sweeney, noted that the FBI had previously received ""a report of a domestic incident,"" adding that ""the allegations [were] recanted."" However, Sweeney did not address terrorism-related allegations. It’s unclear if the FBI or other law enforcement agencies interviewed Rahami in 2014. As in most suspicious activity report cases they review, the FBI found no significant derogatory information in Rahami's case, sources told ABC News. In a statement today, the FBI acknowledged that in August 2014 they ""initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities."" ""The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews -- none of which revealed ties to terrorism,"" the statement said. One source emphasized that only a single report came to authorities related to Rahami. Had more reports come in, authorities would have looked further at him, the source said, adding that the FBI does not have the resources to put every subject of a suspicious activity report under full-time surveillance. ""We should not be keeping people under surveillance indefinitely"" when there is no solid reason, another U.S. official said, adding that doing so would violate Constitutional rights. ""Our job together is to find those needles in a hay stack,"" FBI Director James Comey recently told lawmakers. ""In fact, our job is harder than that, it's to find pieces of hay in that haystack that may become a needle and disrupt them before they move from consuming to acting on that [online] poisonous propaganda."" The FBI’s ability to assess potential terrorists came under intense scrutiny after Florida native Omar Mateen opened fire in Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in June, killing 49 people and injuring scores more. In May 2013 the FBI had obtained sufficient information to open a preliminary investigation into Mateen — coworkers told authorities that Mateen had made terrorism-related comments at work. But after ten months of investigation, including two interviews with Mateen, the FBI determined there wasn’t enough information to indicate he was ""possibly a terrorist,"" as FBI Director James Comey put it after the Orlando attack. Two months later, in July 2014, the FBI took another look at Mateen because his name ""surfaced"" in a separate terrorism investigation, Comey told reporters. Mateen was interviewed again, but authorities found no reason to continue tracking him.",1,0,0
444,"Washington (CNN)Eric Trump on Friday defended his father's self-made real estate mogul narrative, saying the Republican presidential nominee was the epitome of the American dream for having ""gone from just about nothing"" to become a successful real estate mogul in New York. The younger Trump's comments follow extensive reporting of how the GOP presidential candidate got his start in property development in part thanks to a $1 million loan from his father, Fred Trump, in the late 1960s or early 1970s. ""Well, I think he's a guy who has been an entrepreneurial guy,"" Eric Trump told Fox News on Friday after being asked about his father's outreach to millennial voters. ""He's built an amazing company. He's become the epitome of the American dream."" Trump begun to say that millennials could relate to his father because ""he's gone from just about nothing,"" but was interrupted by ""Outnumbered"" panelist Julie Roginsky. ""Nothing? He got a million bucks? I mean, come on,"" Roginsky interjected. ""Listen, he's built an unbelievable empire,"" Trump responded. ""He's epitomized what America is all about: opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?"" Trump continued, ""It's no different from a (Mark) Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That's achieving something, right? And I think it is very different than a person who has been career politician."" In 2015, Donald Trump described the $1 million loan from his father as ""small."" ""My whole life really has been a 'no' and I fought through it,"" Trump said at an NBC-sponsored town hall in October. ""It has not been easy for me, it has not been easy for me. And you know I started off in Brooklyn, my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars."" The 32-year-old Eric Trump on Friday also said that he thought millennials did not relate to policy well because ""they haven't lived their lives long enough to understand ... the broad stroke of issues."" ""They obviously understand a lot of issues as it pertains to them, student debt, and this and that,"" Trump said. ""But I think maybe taxes and things might be a little less significant than other issues. And so I just think there is a disconnect between somebody who is constantly talking about policy and this and that, than a man who's built a great company."" Donald Trump's children have become prominent surrogates for his unconventional presidential campaign, but at times have cause minor controversies of their own. Eric Trump's comments come after his older brother, Donald Jr., caused controversy earlier this week when he likened Syrian refugees to Skittles. ",1,0,0

446,"Washington (CNN)The Cincinnati Enquirer, one of Ohio's largest newspapers, is backing Hillary Clinton after supporting Republican presidential candidates for nearly a century. ""The Enquirer has supported Republicans for president for almost a century -- a tradition this editorial board doesn't take lightly. But this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times,"" the editorial board of the Enquirer published Friday. ""Our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst."" ""That's why there is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton,"" the editorial reads. The Gannett publication announced its endorsement in advance of the first presidential debate between the two nominees. Ohio is a battleground state that both candidates have increasingly worked harder to win. The paper said Clinton was a ""competent"" secretary of state who made ""mistakes"" in Benghazi that were ""tragic"" but called Republicans' assessment of her actions a ""diabolical conspiracy."" ""Clinton, meanwhile, was a competent secretary of state, with far stronger diplomatic skills than she gets credit for. Yes, mistakes were made in Benghazi, and it was tragic that four Americans lost their lives in the 2012 terror attacks on the US consulate there,"" it wrote. ""But the incident was never the diabolical conspiracy that Republicans wanted us to believe, and Clinton was absolved of blame after lengthy investigations."" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is more interested in his self that the country, the paper concludes. ""Trump brands himself as an outsider untainted by special interests, but we see a man utterly corrupted by self-interest. His narcissistic bid for the presidency is more about making himself great than America,"" the board said. ""Trump tears our country and many of its people down with his words so that he can build himself up. What else are we left to believe about a man who tells the American public that he alone can fix what ails us?"" While the editorial board are sympathetic to voters interest in the change that Trump could bring, the Enquirer concludes that not all change is good. ""Our country needs to seek thoughtful change, not just change for the sake of change. Four years is plenty of time to do enough damage that it could take America years to recover from, if at all,"" it wrote. ",1,0,0

On Tuesday, Sweden’s ruling Social Democrat and Green Party coalition will submit a series of proposals to parliament. One would cut the tax rate on repairs to shoes, clothes, and bicycles from 25 to 12 percent, the Guardian reports. Another would allow half of the labor cost of repairing large appliances — fridges, ovens, dishwashers — to be claimed back on incomes taxes. That’s not all: There’s also a plan for a “chemical tax” on new computers and appliances to cover the environmental cost of those new, shiny, and often unrecyclable materials. The parliament will vote on all the proposals in December. “I believe there is a shift in view in Sweden at the moment,” Per Bolund, Sweden’s minister for financial markets and consumer affairs who spearheaded the new incentives, told the Guardian. “There is an increased knowledge that we need to make our things last longer in order to reduce materials’ consumption.” There Sweden goes again, making the rest of us look bad. read more Last week, we recommended reading literally anything that didn’t have to do with the election.

COP22 Though this year’s U.N. climate agenda was notably less ambitious than that of the 2015 Paris meeting, climate conferences always go long. You should know that. Write it down. But there are a few notable outcomes already ironed out, even if negotiators are still scrambling on the final text: thanks obama The Obama administration took a big step in protecting the Arctic Ocean from oil and gas exploration on Friday when it blocked the sale of new permits to drill in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the Alaskan coast until 2022. The move was applauded by environmental groups that have long argued that drilling in the area will harm the Arctic’s fragile ecosystem and contribute to catastrophic climate change. “Given the unique and challenging Arctic environment and industry’s declining interest in the area, forgoing lease sales in the Arctic is the right path forward,” said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell in a statement. Last year, Royal Dutch Shell and other oil companies abandoned plans to drill in the Arctic, citing the high cost of exploration as well as the falling price of oil. (Public outcry may also have had something to do with it). This step by the Obama administration, however, may not last. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to open up new lands to drilling and could ultimately reverse Obama’s decision. how crude An estimated 20 billion barrels of oil has been discovered in West Texas’s Permian Basin. This could be, according to the USGS, the largest supply of oil ever found in the United States, worth up to $900 billion. The timing could not be better for oil prospectors — and worse for the environment. President-elect Donald Trump, who thinks that climate change is a hoax, has pledged to dismantle environmental regulations and rubber stamp fossil fuel projects. There is, however, one silver lining to this discovery: The low price of oil, which is currently around $45 a barrel, means much of the Texas oil will likely remain underground, at least for the immediate future. “We are picking up a few rigs every now and then but we wont see it really take off until we get to that price in the $60 to $75 range,” said Morris Burns, former president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, on KWES TV.

The phrase Mni Wiconi, which means “water is life” in Lakota, has been used to rally support for the movement. The pipeline’s original route was rejected because it was a threat to Bismarck’s water supply, but it now poses that same risk to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux. Despite recent developments that make approval for the pipeline likely, Winona LaDuke, founder of Honor the Earth, warns against despair in the short film: “Don’t operate out of fear; operate out of hope. Because with hope, everything is possible.” Vanishing Act Into the ocean, it seems. New satellite data show the total area of global sea ice dipping wayyy below the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s record for this time of year. In fact, Arctic sea ice has dropped well below the next-lowest seasonal extent ever observed (which was in 2012). That year’s all-time record low was narrowly avoided in September, the month when Arctic sea ice levels typically are at their lowest. But the fact that ice levels are lower now than they were this same time in 2012 is part of what makes this latest data so alarming. Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice is also much lower than usual at the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Both the #Antarctic and #Arctic #seaice extents are abnormally small. That's the story. pic.twitter.com/nObJ4WqsUl — Aarne Granlund (@granlund_aarne) November 17, 2016  We’ve gotten somewhat used to broken records here, but watching sea ice levels flatten out when they should be peaking is well beyond normal understanding of record lows and highs.

1417,"George Bush Sr. is now 92 years-old. Do you remember him? He was the 41st President of the United States and gave an infamous speech for the 1991 State of the Union where he famously said: “What is at stake is more than one small country; it is a big idea: a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind — peace and security, freedom and the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children’s future.” Calling the United States a ‘small country’ was insult enough, but to decide to use America as a tool to ‘achieve universal aspirations of mankind’ is quite another. Mankind doesn’t have any ‘Universal aspirations’. It’s hard enough to get Americans within the same culture to agree on one thing, let alone the whole world of many cultures. I am no conspiracy theorist, but the phrase ‘New World Order’ was coined by our 41st President, so we will have this discussion with that one thing in mind.   It was reported that George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush wanted to stay silent about the upcoming race for the Presidency and who they support. But former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy wanted to find out who Bush Sr. was supporting for the Presidency. She asked him and then immediately took a selfie with him and posted his response on Facebook.   “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!” In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. “That’s what he said,” she told POLITICO. Asked about Townsend’s post, George H.W. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.” I guess my question to you is this: Does it surprise you that the man who said the United States is small and that we must unite in a ‘New World Order’ might be voting for Hillary Clinton? They are very similar in belief. While President, Bush Sr. allowed many of the U.N. entrapments to sneak past our Congress. He introduced the U.N.’s Common Core education, which is an arm of Agenda 21 into our education system in the 90’s. Hillary Clinton also believes the United States to be small and should be more under the reign of U.N. treaties and such. They are not very different at all. Now Trump? That guy is not part of that elite group trying to ‘achieve the universal aspirations of mankind’. He’s all for himself which means in turn he would be the kind of President who would be ALL about the United States. He doesn’t believe the U.S. is one small country, like a cog in a machine. Trump believes that the U.S. IS the machine. Trump’s are not the type of ideals that Bush wants in the White House. It’s dangerous because before you know it the United States would become a sovereign nation in the world once again and then what happens to all the Bush’s and Clinton’s work? Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. One Bush official who has taken Trump’s side is former Vice President Dan Quayle, who told POLITICO in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump. “Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president, but they can speak for themselves,” Quayle said in an interview in July. Dan Quayle was such a stud and polar opposite to GHW Bush. It was very sad for our country to end up with Bush Sr. after Reagan and not a Dan Quayle. ",0,0,1
549,"In advance of Constitution Day, Campus Reform interviewed students at Georgetown University, many of whom suggested that the founding document should be eliminated or replaced because it is too old and “vague.” Several students expressed frustration over the extent to which the Constitution factors into political debates because it includes limitations on the powers of government. Friday is Constitution Day, so Campus Reform stopped by Georgetown University to speak with students about their opinions of the document upon which our nation was founded. When asked about the modern relevance of the Constitution, most students made their opinion clear: the Constitution isn’t something to take too seriously. “People definitely take it too seriously, it’s not 250 years ago,” one student complained. “It’s maybe not as important as it was when it was written… times have obviously changed,” concurred another.

1068,"Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook drew the ire of the hosts of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe” on Wednesday when he repeatedly refused to be drawn out on Clinton’s views on Syria, with an exasperated Joe Scarborough at one point asking, “We love you, buddy, but what are you here for if you can't answer basic questions?” Mook deferred to Clinton when asked about the former secretary of state's biggest regret with respect to the handling of the situation in Syria. Noting, as panelist Willie Geist had, that Clinton was already out of office in 2013 when Syrian President Bashar Assad crossed the White House's ""red line"" by using chemical weapons on his own people, Mook also acknowledged that Clinton was in office when the conflict began in 2011. Story Continued Below ""Well, right, but, you know, she — I think she's well regarded for her leadership as secretary of state. She came out of that office with a 70 percent approval rating. She, in contrast to Donald Trump, has released a clear and decisive plan to defeat ISIS. Donald Trump has said that he thinks he knows more about it than the generals and refuses to tell us what his secret plan is,"" Mook continued. Pressed about the red line, Mook declined to respond as to whether Clinton was ""disappointed"" about President Barack Obama's lack of action. ""I think you'd have to ask her about that question, how she would characterize it,"" Mook responded, to which Geist said, ""Well, you're here to speak for her, Robby. You haven't discussed that at all?"" Laughing, Mook remarked, ""Look, what matters is what she is going to do as president. As I said, she has a clear plan to defeat ISIS. Donald Trump does not. It's a secret. He won't tell anybody what it is and he says he knows more than the generals. I think the choice is clear."" Asked what Clinton would do on Day One in Syria, Mook rehashed Clinton's talking points and directed viewers to the campaign website. Panelist Mike Barnicle, while acknowledging that Mook is not the candidate herself, posed a hypothetical debate question for Clinton at next Monday's debate, asking what the former secretary of state would do to provide aid to the people of eastern Aleppo after the bombing of a relief convoy, differently from the Obama administration. ""Again, I think you're going to have to ask her that question. That's a matter of policy, and I'm going to leave it for her to determine that,"" Mook said. Scarborough then snapped, ""We love you, buddy, but what are you here for if you can't answer basic questions? I mean, I don't know if there's a — I mean, we may be tiptoeing into Gary Johnson territory here if you don't know the answer to that basic of a question. ... then why do we have you here?"" (The Libertarian presidential nominee stumbled on the same show earlier this month when he asked, ""What is Aleppo?"" in response to a question about the conflict.) ""I think — look, you're asking new policy questions. You would have to ask the secretary for that,"" Mook said. ""My job's not to set policy."" ""New?"" Scarborough responded incredulously. ""Aleppo's been around for — Syria's been around for some time. The red line being drawn has been around for some time. I'm not being difficult here at all. These are basic questions."" ""And I'm not being difficult either. I'm simply saying that she has laid out a plan to defeat ISIS, and if there are new questions pertaining to Aleppo, I'm going to need to let her answer those, and she will answer those in the debate, and we look forward to her having the opportunity to do that,"" Mook said. ""And as I said, Donald Trump has been able — unable, rather, to release a plan, and we hope that he will reveal what his plans are in the debate."" As the interview drew to a close, Geist asked Mook about Clinton's current thinking on no-fly zones in Syria, given her past support. ""I'm going to let her statements speak for themselves,"" Mook said, smiling and laughing. Geist followed up, ""Robby, aren't you here representing her point of view?"" ""I am, indeed, and I'm gonna let her language speak for itself,"" Mook said, to which Geist responded that the Clinton aide was saying that Trump would not clarify his policy at the same time he would not address questions about his own candidate's. ""You are quoting Secretary Clinton's plans as she's laid them out. I'm going to let them speak for themselves,"" Mook repeated. ""Donald Trump has not laid out a single plan."" Moments after concluding the interview, Scarborough remarked to the panel, ""So what's going on? I don't understand that. I'm completely flummoxed by that interview."" ""I mean, first of all, are they pleased, and openness with the press,"" he said, referring to Mook's comments earlier in the same interview to that effect. ""I heard after the pneumonia deal they all were chastened and changing their relationship and trying to be more open with the press. Won't respond into Aleppo. Won't respond to the no-fly zone. What's going on here? Better not to come on."" Brad Woodhouse, president of the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record, ripped into the show for its line of questioning. Woodhouse retweeted the Los Angeles Times' Mike Memoli, who asked, ""How much time does @Morning_Joe crew think a campaign manager is spending on Syria policy 50 days out?"" ""No s---. That was ridiculous and uncalled for. Book the policy director for that and the campaign manager to talk about how to get to 270,"" Woodhouse added.",1,0,0

If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!

1413,"The Black Lives Matter movement claims that racism is endemic among the country’s law enforcement agencies — and Hillary Clinton evidently agrees. Rather than understanding that there are a few bad apples in any profession, they paint all police officers with a racist brush. And now, she’s found a new opportunity to pander some more. Terence Crutcher is a black man who was shot by police officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was unarmed and in the police video, can be seen with his hands in the air and his back to police when he was first tazed and then shot. At no point does Crutcher make any aggressive moves towards police, yet for some inexplicable reason, he was shot and killed anyway.   The video makes it clear: this was murder, plain and simple. And the officers responsible should be fully prosecuted. There’s no getting around that. But of course, Hillary used it as an opportunity to smear all police officers, and to stoke racial tensions. Appearing on The Steve Harvey Show, Hillary talked about the Crutcher shooting. “We gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?” she asked. “This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.” Lucky for us, Hillary has a solution to this nationwide problem: vote for her, of course, and these shootings will end!   “Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘Look this is not who we are. We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias’,” she said. “We can do better. We have got to reign in what is absolutely inexplicable.” While she did pay lip service to the many “good honorable cool-headed” police officers around the country, she had absolutely no problem whatsoever exploiting this tragedy in an effort to get more votes. And that’s despicable. She couldn’t even wait for Crutcher’s family to bury him before she started using him as an opportunity to ask people to vote for her. Isn’t she ashamed? Is she not embarrassed? Because really, she should be. What she’s doing is blatant race-baiting. It’s infuriating that liberals can so easily inflame racial tensions for their own gains, while calling everyone else racist. They’re trying to start a race war, and they’re doing it so they can place themselves in positions of power. That’s disgusting. ",0,0,1

Schools have been closed or put on lockdown after alleged clown threats, including two Alabama schools. According to AL.com: “Irondale [Alabama] police Officer James Lewis, a school resource officer, said a student reported to police that a Facebook post hinted at the possibility of clowns showing up on campus at Shades Valley High School. “There was no threat,” Lewis said. Birmingham police said Holy Family Cristo Rey High School in Ensley received a call that a clown was coming to the school to lure children to the woods. Police found nothing, said Sgt. Bryan Shelton. Similar incidents have taken place throughout Alabama, including Flomaton, Etowah County and Montgomery, and across the southeast. In some instances, children have reported clowns trying to lure them into the woods. In other cases, victims have been messaged by the so-called clowns with vulgar language.” So far, investigators have not been able to find hard evidence that there is any truth to these sightings. Thanks to social media, anything that could be the slightest bit interesting is suddenly a huge story.

605,"According to Homeland Security’s Inspector General, at least 858 immigrants from foreign countries that pose national security risks, as well as those from countries with high immigration fraud who had orders to have them deported were “mistakenly” granted citizenship. An internal Homeland Security audit was released Monday, which documented the “mistake.” The Associated Press reports: The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the United States — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials — old paper-based records containing fingerprint information that can’t be searched electronically. DHS says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review “every file” identified as a case of possible fraud. The gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn’t consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. And this is what happens when government puts its nose in things like healthcare and other unconstitutional things it usurps its authority to meddle in. If the central government had been focused only on the things it is authorized to deal with, this matter would more than likely never have occurred. Not only that, but you can rest assured that no one will be held accountable in the matter. While DHS is blaming paper issues and fingerprints, there were some of those who were awarded citizenship that were set to be deported. While Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul called on ICE to have all immigration fingerprints digitized, but the threat to national security is great since citizens can apply and obtain security clearances or take jobs which are security sensitive. According to Roth, at least three of these new citizens acquired aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. He went on to state that their credentials were revoked once it was discovered that they had been given citizenship mistakenly. He also said that another individual had been given the role of a law enforcement officer. While changes were recommended and DHS agreed with them and said they would work to implement them, this problem has been going on for years. According to the AP report, “The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated.” What has really been done about it? Nothing. Are we really to expect something new?

1441,"This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did. Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this. “This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.  From The Daily Caller: Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF. This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money. ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF. Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either. Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant. Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary.  ",0,0,1
1553,"This is just getting pathetic. A restaurant owner in Florida took exception to Hillary’s “basket of deplorables” remark. So on his sign outside, he made a statement: NRA Member… Concealed Carry OK… Not a Deplorable… Vote Trump. This enraged Hillary Clinton supporters who began to mobilize to protest the restaurant. You would think that would actually be a threat since she has 57 offices in the state of Florida and Trump has six. You would be wrong. The owner of the restaurant, Bill Davis, called Trump supporters and they decided to counter the Clinton mob even though they had a 24-hour head start. It wasn’t even a contest. 16 Clinton supporters showed… over 100 Trump supporters made them look weak to say the least. Florida is a must-win state for Clinton. Looks to me as if she is in serious trouble there.  From Top Right News: A restaurant owner in Florida decided to post a sign in favor of Trump, Hillary Clinton’s local office immediately rallied supporters to protest on Facebook. But when they got there, the Democrats found themselves outnumbered — more than 5-to-1 — by Trump fans. Bill Davis, owner of the seafood restaurant Barnicle Bill’s in Sarasota, was upset with Hillary’s description of Trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables.” So he decided to post a sign supporting the GOP nominee:  The sign reads: NRA MEMBER CONCEALED CARRY OK NOT A DEPLORABLE VOTE TRUMP The first debate is tonight and my money is on Trump walking away with it. Clinton is terrible in a debate and the Trump persona will literally overshadow and dwarf the Hildabeast on stage. Trump is leading Clinton in Florida… shows of support like this must terrify Hillary and that is sure to be uppermost in her mind when she scales that stage tonight. Clinton has outspent Trump 5 to 1 and is still losing. And although the polls still show her with a minor edge on winning the election, that is bound to change at this rate. The worm is turning and in the final stretch, Trump could leave her in the political dust of history. If Trump walks away in the debate tonight, Clinton will be all but finished. If she has a potty attack, a seizure, a brain freeze, a stroke or a fainting spell… well, Trump can start picking out drapes for the White House. Trump’s followers have enthusiasm and passion for their candidate. Hillary can’t even get a soul to show up to go door to door for her. Her crowds have been underwhelming to say the least.

1592,"There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now. There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking! The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies? Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?  It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?  Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece. Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.” While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”  Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”  Then Woods added: “She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.” Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches. Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. We’ll let you be the judge. ",0,0,1
1031,"When is the first general election presidential debate? The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26. Story Continued Below What time is the debate and how long is it? The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks. How can I watch the debate? It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN. Who will participate in the debate? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified. Who will moderate the debate? Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor. What is the format of the debate? The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission. Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate? Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold. What's at stake for Hillary Clinton? The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump. What's at stake for Donald Trump? Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again. What is the most watched debate in presidential history? In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers. What's the most-watched television moment of all time? Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24. Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.",1,0,0
905,"A few days ago, Donald Trump’s despicable spawn tweeted out a meme comparing refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm in Syria to “poisoned Skittles,” implying that allowing them to resettle in the United States would lead to increased terrorist attacks. Donald Trump Jr’s meme is referencing an idea with a long history in white supremacist and neo-Nazi thinking and is nothing but a heartless Islamophobic attack against innocent people fleeing an unimaginable hell on earth. Over the past week, hundreds have perished as Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies rain hellfire upon the city of Alepp. Over half a million have perished in Syria’s civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people in cities across Syria are starving, trapped in besieged cities with no way to get fresh food. Hospitals, markets, schools are bombed indiscriminately. Rebel-held areas are dominated by jihadi groups that institute harsh religious law; in regime areas, tens of thousands vanish into the depths of Assad’s prisons to be raped, tortured, and eventually killed. The people of Syria need our help. The conflict is of our making thanks to George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq; our refusal to hold the Assad regime accountable for his crimes means we contribute to the slaughter being perpetrated every day. Comedian Eli Bosnick gave an incredibly powerful explanation for just why the Skittles meme is so offensive – and how we should really feel about accepting refugees.  That’s what real courage looks like. That is how a REAL American, a real human, should feel.",0,1,0
1306,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — The first 20 minutes of the long-awaited showdown between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton appeared to be a draw. It was only later, when Clinton began a barrage of possible explanations for Trump's failure to release his tax returns and then sat back as he squirmed his way through an explanation of his history of birtherism, that her victory became clear. But it was rooted in those opening exchanges and a seemingly off-hand but actually quite deliberate decision by Clinton to bait Trump—by mentioning his father and challenging his own conception as a self-made man. Story Continued Below “Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit,” Clinton started. “He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.” Trump quickly dismissed Clinton’s characterization, saying he received “a very small loan” that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. “I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.” In the moment, he seemed calm—but from that point forward he was anything but. “She mind screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,” said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative in California. “That was brilliant psychological warfare on her part. He slowly unwound from there, culminating is borderline incoherency over the final 30 minutes.” Suddenly, his words were dripping with sarcasm as he asked his rival if he could call her “Secretary Clinton—yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.” His voice rose as he skewered her for flip-flopping on his signature issue of trade. And before long, he was interrupting both Clinton and moderator Lester Holt, interjecting as she ran through allegations that he rooted for the housing crisis and claimed that climate change was “a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.” He remained on the defensive throughout, unwilling to apologize for—or dispute—accusations of stiffing contractors and paying little to no federal income tax. Indeed, by the debate’s end, he’d again defended the years he spent refusing to recognize the U.S. citizenship of the nation’s first black president, showed no quarter on walking back his statements that Clinton, the first woman presidential nominee in the country’s history, “doesn’t have a presidential look,” and spent the final minutes defending having once called Rosie O’Donnell a fat pig. For Trump, who had appeared to pull nearly even with Clinton heading into their first debate showdown before a Super Bowl-sized television audience, it may amount to a colossal missed opportunity. GOP pollster Frank Luntz, who held a focus group of undecided voters in suburban Philadelphia Monday night, reported that 16 of the 22 participants deemed Clinton the winner. If history reflects this debate as a pivotal moment in this campaign, Trump, should he lose support and the White House as a result, will have only his own thin skin and scant impulse control to blame. But it wouldn’t be the first time Trump was thought to lose a debate only to see his standing in the polls improve. Indeed, while insiders and viewers alike handed the win to Clinton, the Republican certainly scored with his base when taking the Democrat to task on trade. But that’s about all. Before the candidates had cleared the stage, Clinton’s surrogates were pouring into the spin room, eager to take a victory lap and to focus their comments on Trump’s angry, animated performance. “He became unhinged,” Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, told reporters. David Plouffe, a top Obama strategist, also noted Trump’s behavioral change as the debate went on. “In the beginning of the debate, he tried to be sedated, straitjacketed Trump, kind of on his best behavior,” he said. “And I think as the debate went on, we saw the Donald Trump all of you have covered: a little bit unhinged, a little bit rattled.” Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s campaign communications director, used the same word—“unhinged”—in describing Trump’s performance. Clinton’s surrogates stuck to their talking points, including their denial that they had planned to bait Trump into a meltdown. “We thought he would hold it together,” she said. “This is not the debate we mocked. We didn’t think this is what he would do; we thought he would come buttoned up, we thought he would be more disciplined.” But, in fact, Clinton’s team had invested in psychological research as to how she might get under Trump’s skin, according to two sources who said her off-hand reference to his father in the debate’s opening minutes was a deliberate calculation. Plouffe, holding court with reporters, didn’t mention the research but explained the analysis, couching it as his own. “My analysis of Trump is the thing he’s most interested in defending is himself—even more than winning the presidency,” Plouffe said. “So any time his record’s challenged, his business record’s challenged, he kind of spends a lot of time on that. I think he spent a lot more time on himself than the American people.” After the debate, Jason Miller, Trump’s senior communications adviser, cast Clinton as “programmed.” Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump had been a “gentleman” for not mentioning Bill Clinton’s past infidelities. As Trump’s staff was spinning hard, most Republicans, from seasoned operatives watching at home, to close Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani who let it slip in the spin rooms that the performance was “not one of his better nights,” concurred. “Trump opened strong and hit some key themes that work for him. He won the early exchanges on jobs and trade, outsider versus politician, and presenting himself as the agent of change,” said Bruce Haynes, a GOP consultant in Washington. “But Trump was not disciplined enough or prepared enough to carry those themes through the debate. Trump found himself discussing Sean Hannity, Sidney Blumenthal and Rosie O'Donnell in a presidential debate. He was like Charlie Brown, he tried to kick every football that Lucy held out there and he missed them every time.” After a dozen GOP primary debates, Trump’s former rivals were hardly surprised to see him so easily baited. “He refuses to let any criticism go unanswered,” said Curt Anderson, who guided Bobby Jindal’s presidential bid last year. “It's a conscious decision on his part. It's a bad decision.” They’d seen this Trump before. We all have. Just never on such a stage. Annie Karni contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1462,"Our Constitution protects the right of people to disrespect this nation. It’s despicable, but such policies help preserve the very foundation of freedom in America.   However, nowhere in the Constitution does it say that every action and speech is protected against consequences. Though one may not be jailed for speaking, that doesn’t mean that employers cannot dictate what speech is acceptable in the workplace. As such, one history teacher who disrespected America has discovered that while his actions did not land him in jail, he has landed in hot water. A teacher on Monday at Massey Hill Classical High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina – home of Fort Bragg and America’s Special Forces – stomped on the flag to prove a point about the value of the First Amendment. Because of this, the teacher has been placed on administrative leave while the school district investigates the incident. Students reported that the teacher had attempted to burn and tear the flag before stomping on it. Several students were upset and some walked out in protest of the disgrace. “I put it on the ground and I used my right foot and I took two steps on it, and immediately two kids get out of the room,” the teacher, Lee Francis, stated. Francis was teaching about the First Amendment and specifically about Texas V. Johnson, a Supreme Court case that struck-down prohibitions on flag desecration. “But this is exactly what I teach: You don’t teach kids how to think or what to think; you teach them to go their own path,” Francis said. “If they feel so convicted that this is their cause they’re going to stand for, I don’t blame them. It’s an upper-level school for those who aspire to go to college and in that regard, we have rigor and expectations, so I treat them as such.” “Not only was the demonstration warranted and justified based on the court, it’s warranted and justified in the rights we have,” he continued. This is the law of the land upheld by the highest court. Freedom of speech is not just defined verbally by something you say or write down on paper, but something that can also be a physical action.” The school district has placed him on paid administrative leave as they investigate. What Francis’ explanation reveals, however, is that he remains ignorant about the world he lives in. Just because something is legal does not mean that it is a good idea and it doesn’t mean that the legal act is not deeply offensive to some or downright inappropriate. If Francis wished to teach about Texas v. Johnson, he should have done so the way countless other teachers have done: by explaining it. Acting-out the provocative action is not necessary and unnecessarily hurtful to members of the fiercely-patriotic Fayetteville community. Unfortunately, “paid administrative leave” sounds an awful like “union-sponsored paid vacation.” ",0,0,1
896,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump’s latest escapade has been to swindle $1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him, according to FEC filings. The Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate. Typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service, and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds. However, Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by, TAG Air, Inc, one of his companies. Therefore, the Secret Service – and the American taxpayer- are literally paying Trump. This is in sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton’s campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways, to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement. One’s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her travel, but selective outrage is their stock and trade. Trump’s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they’ve done. A spokeswoman of Trump’s campaign, Hope Hicks, said, “Everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.” Along with Secret Service payments, Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons. It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels, as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible. This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy.",0,1,0

Burke also estimated that the contentious debate may have been watched by 100 million viewers in the U.S., according to Comcast set-top box data that showed about 35% if U.S. households tuning in. Holt received mixed reactions for moderating the debate between Clinton and Trump, during which he mostly let the candidates hash out the issues without his interference.

Among the poll’s key findings were that 63 percent of young voters thought Clinton won, while just 24 percent named Trump as the victor. Clinton won by 54-36 among women voters, and by a whopping 77-13 margin among voters who identified as either African American or Latino. However, Trump was named the winner among white voters by a slim 47-45 margin. PPP also asked respondents if either candidate could be trusted with nuclear weapons.

252,"Washington (CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knew about the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge while they were going on, federal prosecutors alleged in court Monday during the opening statements for their case against two former Christie confidantes. Prosecutors revealed Monday that they will show Christie was told about the traffic in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and that Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's public safety concerns were ignored, US Department of Justice Public Affairs Officer, Matthew Reilly told CNN. After an unsuccessful run for president, the governor is now chairing the transition effort of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Assistant US Attorney Vikas Khanna said former Christie confidante and Port Authority executive David Wildstein will testify that he told Christie about the plan to close lanes on the George Washington Bridge while it was causing traffic problems in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where the mayor was a political rival of Christie. Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and former Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges in connection to the lane closures, an incident that has come to be known by some as ""Bridgegate."" Text about Christie: He 'flat-out lied' Christie has never been named as a conspirator in the case or charged. Wildstein has pled guilty in the case and pointed to the two staffers on trial. When asked whether Monday's assertions mean charges could be coming for Christie, Reilly said, ""We have not filed any charges and we never discuss whether we will/won't file charges."" CNN has reached out to Christie's office, as well as the offices of Baroni and Kelly's attorneys for comment. A source with ongoing knowledge of the case has told CNN that Monday's assertions by the prosecutor that Christie knew about Bridge-Gate came as a surprise because Christie has never been charged in the case, and because up until now the prosecutors have said they were not bringing charges against the governor. Christie told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday that he would testify if subpoenaed, but didn't expect to be called as a witness. ""Of course I will,"" Christie told Tapper on ""State of the Union."" ""I have been investigated by three different entities, two of them led by partisan Democrats, who have all found that I had no knowledge of this incident and no involvement in it. And so I would have no problem if called to testify by either side. But the fact is that I won't because I really don't have any knowledge of this incident at all."" The traffic headache was allegedly intentionally called for because Sokolich did not endorse Christie's re-election. Baroni and Kelly allegedly ""bragged"" to Christie about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Sokolich was not getting his calls returned, prosecutors said in court according to Reilly. Baroni's attorneys have sought to argue that Baroni is being unfairly singled out in the scheme. In a previous court filing, the attorneys released a text message exchange from a Christie aide saying he ""flat-out lied"" during a news conference about the bridge closures. Christie had said senior staff were not involved in that news event. He later said that staff in his office lied, but that he hadn't known it at the time of the news conference. Attorneys for Kelly and Baroni previously confirmed to CNN that they will both testify in their defense. The trial is expected to last six weeks. Christie has long denied any involvement in the closures and neither the federal investigation nor the New Jersey legislative inquiry has pointed to him. In December 2015, when they were opponents, Trump told an audience in South Carolina Christie ""totally knew about it,"" referring to the Bridgegate closures.

1215,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign on Friday held a conference call urging reporters to “lift up the lies” it expects Donald Trump will tell at Monday's debate. Capitol Hill Republicans leaked news that former Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had been granted partial immunity in the FBI’s email investigation. Democrats and Republicans alike are aiming to influence the debate before the candidates take the stage, with Clinton officials targeting Trump’s slipperiness with the facts and Republicans taking aim at Clinton’s struggles with transparency. Story Continued Below And in their own ways, both sides are aiming to make the debate a referendum on which candidate American voters can trust. “Donald Trump has shown a clear pattern of repeating provably false lies and hoping no one corrects him,” Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement Friday. “Voters and viewers should keep track: any candidate who tells this many lies clearly can’t win the debate on the merits.” The trust issue continues to be the major stumbling block for both candidates. A recent CBS/NYT poll showed that 63 percent of likely voters believe Clinton is not honest or trustworthy, and 60 percent of voters who view Trump as untrustworthy. As a pre-buttal to the debate, the Clinton campaign laid out seven lies that they say Trump should be fact-checked on in real time, including his claim that he has always opposed the war in Iraq (a statement left wholly unchallenged by NBC host Matt Lauer in a presidential forum earlier this month). Meanwhile, Republicans expressed outrage at the latest news from inside the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s email use at the State Department. The immunity deal for Mills and another former Clinton aide, Heather Samuelson, were narrow and covered only their handover of laptops used in 2014 when they were sorting Clinton’s work-related and personal emails. It did not cover any of their statements to the FBI. But that didn't stop the outrage from those trying to prevent Clinton from winning the White House. “The fact that Hillary Clinton’s top aide and attorney was granted immunity by the FBI is shocking,” RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “We now know it wasn’t mere IT staffers that were given a pass, but individuals at the highest levels of this dangerous scheme that jeopardized national security.” Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who remains on his campaign's payroll, tweeted; “Who needs this if NO laws broken?” Clinton campaign officials downplayed the revelation, calling it old information from a closed case that was being leaked for political reasons. “House Republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a Justice Department investigation that was closed months ago, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate,” said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. They predicted the Mills revelation would be a “non-factor” by Monday night, and noted that cable news wasn’t even picking up the story on a busy news day filled with cell phone footage of a fatal police shooting in Charlotte, N.C. Some Clinton allies, however, worried that Lewandowski wasn’t completely wrong in his assessment -- that the previously undisclosed immunity deal, however narrow, fed into the narrative that the Clintons try to hide information in the hopes of gliding past it. “How is it not like pneumonia?” said one Clinton ally worried it gave the appearance of wrong-doing. “It leads to the interference that her top aides needed it. Why did they keep it a secret?” And the ill-timed leak guaranteed that Clinton will not cross the finish line of the election, now just 46 days away, shaking free of the email scandal. But Clinton’s debate prep team, insiders said, has already been anticipating that Trump will grill her hardest on her emails, and don't expect the tidbit of new information to change the narrative. One longtime Clinton ally familiar with the process said the candidate typically spends most of the time in debate prep “working and reworking the answers to the difficult questions.” In this case, the ally said, that section would include “anything to do with the Foundation, anything to do with your illness, and everything to do with your email.”",1,0,0

Meanwhile, multiple police officers and citizens have been injured in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Police say Scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him.

""For example, we have to fund more body cameras. Because what we know is when you have a visual view of what's going on, it helps transparency. Because an issue in a lot of cases is 'Is this a matter of transparency?'""

318,"Washington (CNN)The battle over gun rights returned to the nation's capital Tuesday, as a federal appeals court took up a challenge to a restriction that requires applicants for a license to carry a concealed firearm to demonstrate a ""good reason"" to fear injury to his or her person or property. ""This is the most important question in the Second Amendment today,"" said Adam Winkler of UCLA School of Law. ""Whether people can carry guns in public and under what conditions is a major battleground."" Lawyers for District of Columbia called the license restriction an ""important public safety law"" and argued before a panel of the US District Court for the District of Columbia that the law should be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal. ""This case is in its infancy,"" said Holly M. Johnson, an assistant attorney general for the District. But challengers asked the court to block it, arguing that ""very few people"" will be able to demonstrate that they are eligible for the permit. The three judges hearing the challenge were all nominated by Republican presidents. Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush nominee, asked by far the most questions on the bench. He noted there is a ""long history"" of courts sustaining bans on concealed carry, but, joined by Judge Stephen Williams, a Ronald Reagan appointee, he repeatedly questioned the scope of the DC permit requirement. More than once he asked about someone who lived in a dangerous neighborhood but had never been attacked who might not qualify for the permit. Griffith asked whether someone had to be ""attacked first."" Griffith noted that only a handful of other states have similar laws. The third judge, Karen Henderson, a George H. W. Bush nominee, did not ask a question. One of biggest cases since Heller Eight years ago, it was another Washington gun ordinance that triggered a landmark Supreme Court opinion -- District of Columbia v. Heller -- that held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms. The opinion capped off a decades-long debate on whether the right applied only in connection to service in a state militia. Back in 2008, the law at issue concerned a total ban on handguns in the home. Tuesday's case deals with weapons outside the home. Gun rights advocates thought that Heller -- penned by the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- would encourage courts to strike down restrictions across the country. That didn't happen. Instead, many courts relied upon a different part of Scalia's opinion where he cautioned that the Second Amendment should not be understood as conferring a ""right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has declined to take up any follow-up cases. How Scalia will be replaced has become a major issue in the presidential race. Donald Trump has pledged to appoint conservative justices in the mold of Scalia. Trump's GOP primary rival, Ted Cruz, consistently name-checked the Heller decision. Hillary Clinton has advocated for stronger gun control laws. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama's nominee for the bench, Judge Merrick Garland, waits on the sidelines. The DC law at issue in Tuesday's case is based on similar provisions in New York, Maryland and New Jersey. Several plaintiffs are challenging the law, including Matthew Grace, who says he was denied a permit in 2016 because he had failed to show a ""good or proper reason"" to support his request for a license. He owns four lawfully registered handguns and seeks to carry them outside the home for self-defense. Grace's case and a similar one brought by different plaintiffs split two different district court judges reviewing the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hear both appeals on Tuesday. ""The District of Columbia has spent the last four decades trying to drain the Second Amendment of any meaning,"" Charles Cooper, a lawyer representing Grace and other plaintiffs, argued in court papers. Cooper objects to the fact that DC officials have given themselves the power to decide ""on a case-by-case basis"" whether an applicant has ""good reason"" to obtain a license to carry a concealed gun. He says that such a power is ""categorically irreconcilable"" with the Second Amendment. ""Nearly a decade after Heller, the District of Columbia still refuses to treat the right to bear arms as a genuine constitutional right,"" he said. In their briefs, lawyers for the District of Columbia point out that Washington is ""unique"" in that it is filled with thousands of high ranking federal officials, and diplomats and it hosts hundreds of heavily attended events annually including political marches and protests.

DC is supported by lawyers for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, who emphasize that from 2014 to 2015, the homicide rate in the District increased 54%. ""The District may meet or surpass that tragic record in 2016,"" Jonathan Lowy, an attorney for the Brady Center, argued in briefs. He pointed out that in one DC area -- Ward 7 -- homicides have tripled so far this year. ""It is critical that law enforcement maintain its longstanding authority to prevent the rampant carrying of guns in public places,"" Lowy said in an interview.

1368,"It’s happy times for ISIS and Caliphate supporters everywhere as they deliriously report and applaud the allegedly terrorist bomb that exploded in New York and the ISIS inspired knife attacker in a Minnesota mall. After the bomb went off, social media blew up with proud jihadist sympathizers scoring one for their team. Some of the comments on social media were as follows; “The lions of the Caliphate roar in New York, we cause you pain inside your house, the carrier of the Cross,” wrote one Twitter user who went by the name “I am ISIS, come and block me.” The account was soon suspended. Another, called “The Lone Wolves,” tweeted with the Arabic hashtag #ExplosionManhattanNewYork “Oh God burn America, take revenge in the name of your oppressed slaves and believers’ blood.” Others tweeted about “good tidings that keep coming” from New York, and one user affiliated with al-Qaeda in Syria tweeted: “Oh God go against America, the head of infidels. Oh God, count them and kill them one by one, and do not spare anyone of them.”   Evil walks this earth. It’s name is radical Islamic terrorism. It celebrates when the blood of infidels (meaning regular people who do not agree with radical Islam) is spilled. It laughs with glee when New York is terrorized. It mocks westerners, Americans, Christians and Jews. It cares nothing for pain, suffering and outrage. It wishes and works for the day that Islam dominates the earth. That evil prowls social media taking credit for and celebrating bloodshed. And this newest event is no exception. There is joy among jihadists as New Yorkers and Minnesotans lie in their own blood. They need to be stopped. But who will do it? See video of explosion below.   ",0,0,1
277,"Washington (CNN)The battle over gun rights returned to the nation's capital Tuesday, as a federal appeals court took up a challenge to a restriction that requires applicants for a license to carry a concealed firearm to demonstrate a ""good reason"" to fear injury to his or her person or property. ""This is the most important question in the Second Amendment today,"" said Adam Winkler of UCLA School of Law. ""Whether people can carry guns in public and under what conditions is a major battleground."" Lawyers for District of Columbia called the license restriction an ""important public safety law"" and argued before a panel of the US District Court for the District of Columbia that the law should be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal. ""This case is in its infancy,"" said Holly M. Johnson, an assistant attorney general for the District. But challengers asked the court to block it, arguing that ""very few people"" will be able to demonstrate that they are eligible for the permit. The three judges hearing the challenge were all nominated by Republican presidents. Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush nominee, asked by far the most questions on the bench. He noted there is a ""long history"" of courts sustaining bans on concealed carry, but, joined by Judge Stephen Williams, a Ronald Reagan appointee, he repeatedly questioned the scope of the DC permit requirement. More than once he asked about someone who lived in a dangerous neighborhood but had never been attacked who might not qualify for the permit. Griffith asked whether someone had to be ""attacked first."" Griffith noted that only a handful of other states have similar laws. The third judge, Karen Henderson, a George H. W. Bush nominee, did not ask a question. One of biggest cases since Heller Eight years ago, it was another Washington gun ordinance that triggered a landmark Supreme Court opinion -- District of Columbia v. Heller -- that held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to bear arms.

1615,"A local prosecutor in Tulsa, Oklahoma has brought charges against Betty Shelby, the officer who shot and killed Terence Crutcher. In a press conference Thursday afternoon, the Tulsa County District Attorney’s office announced a warrant for Officer Betty Shelby’s arrest on the charge of felony manslaughter in the first degree. Shelby fired the shot that killed 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands raised throughout his fatal encounter with police last weekend. BREAKING: #Tulsa DA files 1st degree manslaughter charges #BettyShelby for #TerenceCruther shooting. pic.twitter.com/h4PC6EBWwm — Tiffany Alaniz (@TiffanyAlaniz) September 22, 2016  “I don’t know why things happen in this world the way they do,” said District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler. “We need to pray for wisdom and guidance on each of our respective paths in life. Each of us at the end of our days will have to account for our own actions. The only way I know to walk my path is to try every day to pray and to serve my fellow citizens so that he or she may be lifted up.” Tulsa’s top law enforcement officer appealed to the community to allow the judicial system to do its work. Tulsa police chief Chuck Jordan has contacted the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), asking them to conduct their own separate civil rights investigation into the shooting. “I want to assure our community and assure all of you, and people across the nation looking at this, we will achieve justice,” Jordan said. Shelby is arguing that she had a right to shoot Crutcher because he allegedly failed to obey her commands. Her attorney, Scott Wood, said Shelby was a drug recognition expert and believed Crutcher was under the influence of drugs when she encountered him. “By the end of the incident, Officer Shelby was screaming at him to stop. He did not obey one single command given to him,” Wood told local media. Newson6.com reported that Officer Shelby had two prior excessive force complaints lodged against her during the course of her career, though both were unfounded. U.S. Attorney Danny Williams said the DOJ will thoroughly investigate whether or not Crutcher’s civil rights were infringed upon. “Will devote whatever resources necessary to ensure all allegations of serious civil rights violations are fully and completely investigated,” Williams said. Crutcher, a father of four, was on his way home from a community college class when his SUV broke down. When officers responded, Crutcher, who had his hands up, was shot when he walked toward his driver side window. Officers did not find a weapon on Crutcher’s person or in his vehicle.        ",0,1,0
152,"The season premiere of the hit television dramaÂ features an amazing song performed byÂ Jussie Smollett, who plays Jamal on the show. The song, entitled âNeed Freedomâ has a very clear message: gun violence, senseless killings, and police brutality against people of color must stop, because our nation is ripping itself apart. Smollett says of the decisions that inspired him to record âNeed Freedomâ: âI recorded this exactly seven days after Philando Castile was shot. Between the shootings of Castile, Alton Sterling, at the Pulse in Orlando and the police officers in Dallas â not to mention the other numerous killings over the last couple of years â it was like we couldnât breathe. What are we doing as a people, a nation; what messages are we sending to the next generation. Then this song came.â Smollet is right, of course, and what better way to inspire people in an effort to draw peace in such a tense and violent time, where there is such anger, such division, such justified outrage, than by doing so in song? Here are just a few of the more inspiring lyrics from Smolletâs song: As I sit and think about All thatâs goinâ on My soul just cries out Can you tell me please? Tell me whoâs to blame For causing all this pain The oneâs we call to help us turn They kills us everyday See war is not the answer And love is what we need Take the chains off, break the bondage Set my people free We gotta make it better Somethingâs gotta change The world needs your voice just to make it through the rain When I think of whatâs goinâ on in this world Ohh it gets me to see my sister not breathe My sister, my brother here with me Need freedom Our world is cryinâ, no more silence, with guns and violence Need freedom I canât keep dyinâ, weâre way too quiet, no more silence Need freedom Stop this evil, free my people, weâre all equal Need freedom Our world getâs brighter, keep on tryinâ, keep on fightinâ for freedom These lyrics come on this night, September 21, as, at this very moment, protests are erupting in Charlotte, North Carolina, because yet another black man, Keith Lamont Scott, is dead at the hands of the police. Already, as per usual, the police are in front of cameras, in damage control mode, spinning the story they want the public to hear. Whether it is true matters not to them; they only want to cover their own asses, because black lives simply donât matter to them. This message is one that is definitely needed. It is, of course, a message that will likely fall on deaf ears. We live in a nation where people think that the right of every person to have as many guns as they like, anytime they like, no matter what, should supercede the rights of innocent people to live. These are the same people who think that cops can do no wrong, and that the bloodshed at their hands is always justified. These are same people who believe that freedom only applies to certain people, and to hell with everyone else. Theyâre the people who think that every black man shot by police was just another âthugâ anyway, and that the void left in the lives of his loved ones is of no importance. Theyâre the same people who donât care about what happened in Orlando, or Oregon, or Newtown, or any of the other countless places where people who should have never had firearms carried out massacres. They only care about their guns and their rigid belief that whatever happened was worth their version of âfreedom.â Hopefully, the people who need to hear this message the most will, and the killing will stop. However, I sadly wonât be able to hold my breath on that one. It will only continue another day, in another city after another innocent life is lost, or another unbelievably tragic and preventable massacre is carried out. Sadly, that is the America we live in today. Watch the video below:  ",0,1,0
159,"On Wednesday, talk show legend Montel Williams posed a very simple question for conservatives: when are you going to take responsibility for their role in helping to create the violent situation in Charlotte, North Carolina? Just hours after Donald Trump proposed nationwide “Stop and Frisk” — a policy that was declared unconstitutional in New York. Responding to a question about “black-on-black crime,” Trump said he would “do stop-and-frisk” to solve the problem. “We did it in New York,” he said. “It worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive.” Stop-and-frisk did not, in fact, “work incredibly well.” In 2011, for example, black and Latino residents made up about 90 percent of people stopped, and 88 percent of those were innocent. Even in predominantly white neighborhoods, blacks and Latinos were stopped more than whites. “Donald Trump is having trouble with the facts,” New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito said in a statement regarding Trump’s remarks. “Stop and frisk as it was applied in New York City was unconstitutional, it didn’t reduce crime and it severely corroded the relationship between the police and the communities they serve.” Yes, “stop-and-frisk” is a racist practice, but his suggestion that it should be implemented nationwide really resonates with some of Trump’s die-hard supporters — namely white supremacists. “When are conservatives going to own their damn part in this? That asshole Trump just proposed national stop and frisk?” Williams, who has also been critical of protesters who have chosen to become violent, asked on Twitter. “WTF?” One of Trump’s “deplorables” calling himself “Big Daddy” climbed out of his basket and once again proved Hillary Clinton’s assessment of The Donald’s meth-fueled legion of ignoramuses correct. “He will control n*ggers unlike you cucks,” Big Daddy informed Williams. Naturally, more of Trump’s “deplorables” came out to play:  But Trump’s acolyte apparently did not know to whom he was speaking. “And now we know why these white supremacist bumpkins with no teeth married to their cousins love Trump,” Williams shot back:  “Big Daddy” has since slithered back into the basket and closed it, changing his name and protecting his tweets presumably because he realized that when you say racist things on the internet, people notice.  It’s interesting how “brave” Trump’s paper tigers are until someone puts them in their place. Featured image via screengrab  ",0,1,0
486,"Washington (CNN)Is NRA-backed Donald Trump going anti-gun? Only for ""bad people."" Trump said Monday that he wants to take guns ""away from criminals,"" and continued to praise the controversial stop-and-frisk policy during the first presidential debate, at Hofstra University. ""We have gangs roaming the street and in many cases they're illegally here, illegal immigrants, and they have guns and they shoot people,"" he told moderator Lester Holt of ""NBC News."" ""And we have to be strong and we have to be vigilant. Right now our police are afraid to do anything."" He added: ""We have to bring back law and order. Now whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop-and-frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, it worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate very down. But you take the guns away from criminals who shouldn't be having it."" Stop-and-frisk is a type of aggressive policing that allows -- some say encourages -- officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon is found. Critics of the program questioned its constitutionality. They also pointed to the fact, documented in several studies, that the policy falls heaviest on black and Latino men. Holt said to Trump: ""Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it largely singled out black and Hispanic men."" ""No, you're wrong,"" Trump responded. ""It went before a judge who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. It would have won an appeal."" ""The argument is that it's a form racial profiling,"" Holt said. ""The argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn't have them. These are felons, these are people that are bad people,"" Trump said. ",1,0,0
935,"Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently featured former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, Between Two Ferns. Previously, he’s interviewed President Obama as well as other celebrities like Brad Pitt and Justin Beiber, but there’s one person he refuses to have on the show. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Galifianakis was asked if he would have Republican nominee Donald Trump on his show since his interview with Clinton was such a resounding success – and his answer is hilarious. “No. That doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way doesn’t interest me. He’s the kind of guy who likes attention – bad attention or good attention. So you’re dealing with a psychosis there that’s a little weird. I wouldn’t have somebody on that’s so mentally challenged. I feel like I’d be taking advantage of him. And you can print that.” Between Two Ferns is known for its exceptionally awkward dialogue and for the host’s fondness for asking uncomfortable questions (he once asked Pres. Obama “How does it feel to know you’re going to be the last black president?”). Part of the joke is both parties attempting to maintain their composure and not rising to the bait. Judging from the way that Donald Trump lashes out like a wounded animal at the slightest provocation and is utterly incapable of letting the pettiest slight go without a response, it’s safe to say that Galifinakis is right about how Trump would fare on his show. But it’s terrifying to think that a man who couldn’t handle being on a comedy interview show has a real shot at ascending to the presidency of the United States; he has shown time and time again that he is temperamentally unfit for the office.",0,1,0

1242,"Hours ahead of its face-off with Hillary Clinton on Monday night, Donald Trump’s campaign suggested that it won’t be treated fairly in the aftermath, surmising that headlines have already been written before either candidate has taken the stage. “I’m worried, Mika, about not being treated fairly afterwards. I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough in an interview Monday morning. “You saw — and others were talking about it in the earlier segment — that this weekend was spent by editorial writers and people on Twitter and elsewhere really just trying to undercut Donald Trump before the debate.” Story Continued Below Those same people, Conway continued, are “somehow putting the burden on the media to prop up Hillary Clinton and pregame the debate,” adding, “That’s not the role of the media.” Scarborough interjected, remarking that “it’s almost like they don’t think Hillary Clinton is strong enough to do it on her own.” “That’s the key,” Conway said. “We can scream bias and unfairness, but what Joe just said is really the key here, that they’re worried about her debating skills.” Conway, a pollster who was promoted to run the third iteration of the real estate mogul’s campaign, said despite Clinton’s participation in nearly three dozen debates, “There’s no connection that we can see between her debate performances and any type of major lift in the polls thereafter, and I think they know that over in Brooklyn.” But Trump’s biggest problem Monday night will be what Barack Obama said during his bitter 2008 primary battle against Clinton: that she’ll say anything to get elected, Conway said. “So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.”",1,0,0

David Kittos, 48, who told ABC News he took the photo and who has what appears to be an identical image posted on Flickr from 2010, said, ""How someone could twist things, and I don’t know, use my image to compare some sort of poor refugee to a poison sort of Skittle, that is just really beyond belief.""     Kittos, who said he lives in the United Kingdom and left Cyprus as a refugee when he was 6, claims that he was not asked permission for use of his photo. ""I haven’t put the image for sale, and it was all rights reserved, so no, I wasn’t really expecting anyone to want to take it,"" Kittos said. ""I have had stuff stolen before but when I got an email from some news website I was sort of really annoyed and disgusted to be honest."" Kittos told ABC News he does photography as a hobby and took the Skittles photo while experimenting with different flash techniques in his living room six years ago, never expecting it to become part of a political campaign. The plight of refugees is an issue close to Kittos, who recalls fleeing Cyprus as a child. ""We all had to kind of just take our stuff and run away. It was quite frightening for all people who had to do it, especially for the people who actually lost family and not just their belongings,"" he said. If he could talk to Donald Trump, Kittos said he would ask him to apologize to Syrian refugees. ""But I don’t expect he will do that,"" he said. The Trump campaign responded to a question about the photo with a more general comment on the controversy over the tweet. ""America has become less safe under Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Clinton's planned 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees is a dangerous proposal that will put American lives at risk,"" the campaign's senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, said in a statement. ""Speaking the truth might upset those who would rather be politically correct than safe, but the American people want a change, and only Donald Trump will do what's needed to protect us,"" the statement said.",1,0,0

365,"Washington (CNN)Rep. John Lewis, a pioneer in the civil rights movement, wants the Obama administration to appoint observers for the November election in certain states. ""We should ask for federal protection,"" the Georgia Democrat said Wednesday, warning ""the election can be stolen on election day at polling places."" Lewis, who was badly injured in 1965 while marching in Selma, Alabama for voting rights for African-Americans, said several states including Georgia, Florida, Ohio and North Carolina should be monitored, and potentially all of the states that belonged to the confederacy. Lewis made his comments at a roundtable on voting rights with other Democrats and advocacy groups held in the room in the Capitol named after President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who signed the landmark voting right law. In August, the Supreme Court denied a request from North Carolina to allow provisions of its controversial voting rights law to go back into effect. The Supreme Court order meant provisions of the law -- concerning a tightening in voter ID requirements, cutbacks on early voting and the preregistration of 16-year-olds -- will remain off the books for November's election. The court's order was a major victory for challengers to the law, including civil rights groups and the Department of Justice, which argued that it had a disparate impact on minority voters. Lewis said the 2016 presidential election is the first since 1965 that voters don't have the full protections of the Voting Rights Act due to a Supreme Court ruling three years ago. The lawmaker said it was a ""shame and a disgrace"" that Congress hasn't acted on the issue. In 2013, the Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 decision that key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are no longer valid. The opinion left it to Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices. Chief Justice John Roberts explained the ruling saying ""our country has changed"" for the better. And that the conditions that moved Congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the United States to ""preclear"" changes to voting laws ""no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.""

895,"Hillary Clinton proposed on Thursday a new series of progressive taxes that would raise rates on the nation’s ultra-rich. The most significant of her new proposals calls for raising the top estate tax rate to 65% from the current 40%, a move that would generate about $260 billion in new government revenue over the next decade. Clinton had already proposed raising the rate on some millionaires to 45%, but her new plan, drawing heavily on that of her social democratic primary challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), would be even more progressive. Three new estate tax brackets would be added under the new system: a 50% rate for couples with estates valued over $10 million, a 55% rate for couples with estates valued over $50 million, and a 65% rate for couples with estates valued over $1 billion. Although the Trump campaign predictably railed against an “even higher hike in the death tax,” only an infinitesimal number of incredibly wealthy Americans would be affected by the new rates. According to IRS data only 223 estates with taxable value over $50 million filed estate tax claims in 2014, and there are fewer than 1,000 people in the entire country who would ever be subjected to the highest rate. This very minimal burden on a tiny number of families that are more than able to shoulder it would pay for Clinton’s proposed simplification of small business taxes and expansion of the child tax credit, programs that will millions of Americans. While cynical Republican demagogues have painted the estate tax as an oppressive punishment for small businesses, couples with less than $5.5 million in assets – or 99.8% of the nation – pay no estate tax at all. The rhetorical acrobatics and outright lies required to convince the average American that they are at risk from the so-called “death tax” is astounding. In reality, Clinton’s proposed hikes would actually lessen the tax burden on small businesses by financing a simplification of the business tax code. All in all, Clinton’s tax proposals would generate about $1.5 trillion in new revenue over the next decade, with the vast majority of the burden falling on the super-rich. Donald Trump, in contrast, has called for eliminating the estate tax entirely and slashing taxes by $12 trillion over the next decade, a move that most reasonable economists agree would cause a severe recession and eliminate a staggering 3.5 million jobs. The Clinton campaign reportedly collaborated with Sen. Sanders’ former economic advisers to produce the new estate tax plan, and indeed it is almost identical to Sanders’ primary proposal. Today’s announcement was thus one of the most concrete examples of Clinton’s shifting leftward in an attempt to win over skeptical progressives who supported Sanders in the primary. Sanders himself praised the proposal and released a statement endorsing it, saying that “Secretary Clinton understands that it is appropriate to ask the top three-tenths of 1%, the very wealthiest people in this country, to pay their fair share of taxes so that we can provide a child tax credit for millions of working families and lower taxes for small businesses.”",0,1,0
109,"The hosts of were hoping a Minnesota police chief would vilify the Somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them. On Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir A. Adan went on a stabbing spree inside a Minnesota mall. The Somali community in St. Cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism, but Republican nominee Donald Trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with Fox and called the immigrants a âTrojan horseâ and a âcancer from withinâ that benefits ISIS. Fox host Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlsonâs sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network, asked St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson if he agrees with Trumpâs assessment of immigrants, clearly hoping that Anderson would join in demonizing them. Instead, Anderson swatted Doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate. âMy job is public safety. Itâs not in immigration policy. I can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens, no matter their ethnicity, are fine, hard-working people, and now is not the time for us to be divisive. We already have a very cohesive community, and I expect that this will draw us even closer together. But at the end of the day, our job is public safety, period.â Anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can. âWe actually work very well not just with our East African community, but all of our community. We meet regularly with any number of people, whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause. Itâs one of things that makes St. Cloud a wonderful place to live, and I know that might sound corny, but itâs the truth. We have established and maintained a very good rapport with our East African community and our community at large.â Doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because he didnât get the response he wanted. Hereâs the video via  Demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize. Thatâs why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them. Fox News is irresponsibly pushing an âus versus themâ mentality that only creates a never-ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long-term. But letâs also remember that ISIS would not exist to recruit people in America in the first place had Republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in Iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise. Furthermore, despite their concerns and their whining, Republicans still refuse to declare war on ISIS to give President Obama the full resources of the United States to fight the terrorist organization. Regardless, any group will have bad apples, even the white âChristiansâ Fox News caters to. Letâs not forget that Timothy McVeigh committed the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people while Dylan Roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in 2015. Both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the United States. But Fox News would rather freak out about a Somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed. If Adan were white, not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror, it would have been a mere footnote in the news. ",0,1,0
1476,"WSOCTV is now reporting that there is dash cam footage of Keith Scott getting out of his car with a gun in his hand and approaching police officers. The police are not releasing the footage currently… they can’t. This is an internal affairs investigation and the footage will be used in court. Until the attorneys clear it, that video won’t be released. It sounds as though the guy had a thigh holster that had a gun in it that he pulled when he was approached. The excuse he didn’t know they were police officers won’t hold up either… they identified themselves as such when they commanded him to get out of his car. No book was found anywhere. The story his daughter is circulating to gin up racial animosity and riots is a lie.  From Gateway Pundit: Charlotte police reportedly have video of Keith Scott exiting his car, moving toward police officers, with a gun in his hand. And now race protesters are beating cops, tackling reporters, rioting and looting stores. Including the Hornets team store at the arena. […] The protest leaders are encouraging the community to fight back. After Keith Scott came after a cop with a gun and was shot dead. […] Keith Scott wasn’t holding a book. He was holding a gun and had a holster strapped to his leg. Currently, one protester is hanging on to life in critical condition after a second night of rioting. He was shot in the head by another protester. Cops and protesters have both been sent to hospitals and the violence is getting worse. The governor has now declared an emergency in Charlotte and the National Guard have been called in. A curfew is being considered as well. Scott charged those officers before he was shot and killed. Chief Kerr Putney told reporters on Wednesday that Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott with a handgun and that Scott would not drop it after being ordered to do so. The officer that shot him followed procedure and did the right thing here. But it hardly matters… any excuse will do… any lie will do to start a race war and a riot. Charlotte exemplifies that. In the meantime, the riots continue and it is only a matter of time at this rate until someone is killed. Looting is rampant and the media have been attacked and brutalized. A photographer was shoved to the ground and then protesters tried to throw him into a fire. This is the chaos and violence Obama has been fomenting in our streets. It’s about to explode massively.

937,"The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded as Mitch McConnell and other Republicans insisted on keeping corporate political funding hidden from voters and denying aid to the beleaguered residents of Flint, MI. Senators have been working in recent days on hammering out a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would fund the government until December 9 at the least. Absent such an agreement, the federal government will run out of money and shut down in three days on October 1. The intransigence of Senate Republicans on the issues of corporate financing and aid to Flint, however, have prevented the bill from passing as the Senate shot down a GOP continuing resolution today by a 55-45 vote. The first sticking point is a rider that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on adding to the bill and which would block the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) from requiring publicly-traded corporations to disclose their political spending. Ever since the Citizens United decision of 2010, corporate donors have been able to make unlimited political donations without disclosing any information on their political spending to the public. This has led to an unprecedented influx of corporate and big donor money in American elections – close to $700 million so far this year – and has served Republicans and their big-money donors quite well. So well, in fact, that Senate Republicans are willing to sacrifice the functioning of the government itself just to be able to keep the nefarious sources of their campaign financing secret and please the oligarchs who pull their strings. Clashes have also arisen over Republican refusal to include in the bill aid to the city of Flint, MI, which is still suffering from the effects of a neoconservative-engineered lead poisoning crisis. The bill already includes flood aid for flood victims in Maryland, West Virginia, and Louisiana, and Democrats have requested that aid for the victims of the water crisis in Flint be included as well. Republicans, however, have refused to add this money, and have come up with a variety of facetious justifications for their indifference to the sufferings of poor African-Americans, from claiming that the Flint crisis is a local issue to deciding that the Flint aid should be included in the separate Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) instead. The problem with that excuse is that Democrats have already tried to pass the Flint aid through WRDA but came up against the same wall of Republican intransigence and indifference there. The Senate successfully passed a version of the WRDA earlier this year that included more than $220 million in aid and infrastructure improvements for Flint. Paul Ryan and his band of extremist Republicans in the House, however, stripped the Flint aid provision from the House version of the WRDA, and the discrepancy between the bills would have to be settled in conference committee negotiations after the November election, and the dominance of hardline Republicans in the House makes it very unlikely that such a settlement would include aid to Flint. So, once again, Republicans, for whom compromise and good governance seem to be alien concepts, are sending the federal government hurtling down the path to shutdown for absolutely no good reason. The issues underlying this most recent case of intransigence, however, demonstrate more clearly than ever the degree to which many Republicans have ceased to serve the people they are elected to protect and instead devote all of their efforts to aiding their corporate sponsors. If the health and livelihood of this nation’s oppressed minorities have to be sacrificed in the process, these Republicans won’t bat an eye.",0,1,0
654,"In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule. Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!   There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist. I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.  I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down. Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer. As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.” Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores. Expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days. ",0,0,1

777,"I don’t know what it’s like to be dumb. I have been a thinking individual my entire life. So being able to relate to 18-yr-old Zannay Laws and Dakei Perry and why they filmed themselves beating up and robbing an old man to post on social media will be a challenge. Based on their actions I can only say they were probably both dropped on their heads at birth and since then joined the Black Lives Matter movement. They seem to share the same mentality. A 64-year-old man was reading a book at 5 p.m. in the North Baltimore park near the Johns Hopkins University, little did he know that he was about to get the shock of his life. A group of young thugs found him and decided to rob him, but not in the normal robber way of “give me all your money”, they wanted to have some ‘fun’ with it. These millennials decided to film the whole thing for ‘prosperity’ or something (doubt they know the definition of the word). The first suspect held a gun to his head demanding his stuff like cellphone and money. The second stabbed the poor old man in his lower back. Even thought the man was incapacitated and had a gun on him, the third decided to spray mace in his face. Someone stabbed him again, this time in the right arm and the suspects took his iPhone, backpack and $60. All THIS while LIVE streaming on Facebook. Wow… brilliant folks we got here. They filmed their entire crime and put it out there for people to see, did they not know they created the best evidence to land themselves in jail? Serious asshats! Police spokesman T.J. Smith said, “Criminals do some crazy things. They record themselves committing crimes, and we thank them for it. We encourage the criminals to continue to record your acts, and encourage citizens to continue to send us information when you find the criminal wrongdoing on camera and on social media.” Smith said detectives were working to confirm the identities of the other two suspects, but said they believe the group has committed a series of crimes in the area. Smith called it a “little crime spree.” This group is suspected of other similar type crimes in the neighborhood and one in custody has already started singing. Would you at any age or stage in your life think stabbing and mace-ing an old man was fun? I’m just curious if this is only a Black Lives Matter thing. ",0,0,1

429,"(CNN)President Barack Obama sharply criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for saying earlier this week that the black community is in the worst shape it's ""ever been in before."" ""I think even most 8-year-olds will tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people,"" Obama told ABC News in an interview that aired Friday on ""Good Morning America."" ""Jim Crow wasn't very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make even more progress in the future."" Obama's comments reflected the wide gulf between the President and Trump that came into greater focus this week as race again became a top issue in the 2016 campaign following fatal police shootings of African-American men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Speaking before a mostly white audience Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump spoke of the need to ""rebuild our inner cities."" ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said. The speech was part of a high-profile push by the Trump campaign to plug gaps in poll numbers with minority voters, and also to win over white voters turned off by divisive rhetoric from Trump that critics have repeatedly labeled as racist. Still, the effort has stumbled. By proposing the expansion of the controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" program as a way to improve urban policing -- and by engaging in a public re-litigation of the baseless ""birther"" controversy that critics labeled racist -- Trump spent much of the last week doing damage control with the same voters he'd hoped to attract. All the while, Obama has positioned himself as one of Trump's most vocal critics -- and rival Hillary Clinton's biggest cheerleader. Speaking to reporters gathered in the Oval Office last Friday, Obama sarcastically dismissed Trump's ""birther"" capitulation. ""I was pretty confident about where I was born, I think most people were as well,"" he said. ""My hope would be the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that."" And the president made a more earnest effort to rebut Trump when he spoke at the Congressional Black Caucus gala on Saturday, and said that he would consider it a ""personal insult"" to his legacy if black voters didn't turn out for Clinton. Newest absentee, registration numbers promising for Clinton ""If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect -- read up on your history. It matters. We've got to get people to vote,"" Obama said. ""I will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote."" At the event, Obama also criticized Trump for using hyperbolic language when discussing African-Americans, and suggested that Trump visit the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture for perspective. ""You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,"" he said. ""But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him.""

86,"Monday night was Donald Trump's introduction to the general-election debate stage. On display was the Republican presidential nominee as a dichotomy; there was the, albeit briefly, measured Trump who forwent his usual “Crooked Hillary” for “Secretary Clinton” as he addressed his Democratic rival. And, defying expectations, he did not address her husband's marital indiscretions, later saying he abstained out of respect for Chelsea Clinton, who was in the room. In his second form, the businessman displayed his usual bombast and penchant for attacks, showcasing style perhaps over substance. Members of his campaign team were trying to lower debate expectations of Trump, leaking to reporters that he was shunning policy briefings and not standing at faux lecterns for 90 minutes at a time in preparation. They instead praised his freewheeling style and confidence and criticized Hillary Clinton for being overly prepared. ""I thought my prep was very good. I think my prep was very good. And I really enjoyed it,"" Trump told ABC News' Tom Llamas last night. Trump, while forceful in his attacks, appeared to miss key opportunities to contrast himself with his opponent. During the 90-minute debate, Trump never mentioned the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, even after Clinton invoked Libya and his comments about her private email server were sparse. Such attacks on key issues are typically practiced during debate prep sessions; according to his advisers, Trump never participated in a mock debate. During a phone interview this morning on ""Fox & Friends,"" the hosts asked Trump if he had any regrets about his performance. ""Do you regret not bringing up the emails as much? You brought it up at one point,"" host Ainsley Earhardt asked. She followed up by asking why he did not expand his attacks on Clinton's email server or the Clinton Foundation. ""I would have liked to have done that,"" Trump responded. ""But the question weren't — I mean, don't forget you are asked a question as to progress or something, and it's hard to get off to Benghazi sometimes the way the questions were framed. You know, you start off open a totally — the opposite of Benghazi, and so Benghazi can't get brought up, but it was a very interesting evening. I thought it was good."" He landed blistering attacks on Clinton on trade, one of his signature issues, effectively highlighting her weaknesses in supporting, then denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But he seemed to falter when questioned about his past actions. When asked what took him so long to accept the fact that President Barack Obama was born in the country, Trump reverted to the lie that the Clinton campaign pushed the birther issue before the Democratic primaries eight years ago. Trump's answer to the question caused some voters to lower their approval rating of him, according to a focus group hosted by veteran pollster Frank Luntz. ""I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job,"" Trump said during the debate. In another misstep, he admitted during a heated exchange with Clinton on tax returns that he did not pay federal taxes. ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,"" Clinton said. ""Because the only years that anybody has ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."" ""That makes me smart,"" he retorted. But Trump, ever the showman, delivered several quick-witted exchanges that elicited laughter from the audience. ""Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, yes, is that OK?"" he asked, looking her for approval. As she nodded, he added, ""Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.""",1,0,0

1053,"Democrats have some advice for Hillary Clinton at her first presidential debate: Let Trump be Trump. Donald Trump’s more tightly scripted campaign of late could backfire on him when he squares off against Clinton on Monday in Hempstead, New York, Democrats believe. He won’t be able to rely on the teleprompter he’s been using of late, they say, and Trump’s only recent extended interview with The Washington Post showed that, left to his own devices, he’s apt to stumble back into controversy on issues like Barack Obama’s birthplace. Story Continued Below “He’s going to say some cockamamie stuff,” said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “Give him the rope.” Indeed, the best strategy for Clinton, lawmakers advised, is to let Trump do most of the talking. “Inevitably, he’s going to say enough dumb things to dominate the headlines,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “He’s gonna make mistakes; the question is, how big are the mistakes? And I’m certain there are things she can do that would cause his mistakes to be bigger.” Clinton will have to parry when Trump comes directly at her, but a more restrained rope-a-dope strategy is preferable to an aggressive posture right out of the gate, Democratic senators said. Trump showed in the Republican debates that he’s best as a counter-puncher, leveling spontaneous one-liners at his attackers that left them reeling. In one debate alone, Trump dubbed Sen. Marco Rubio a “choke artist” and Sen. Ted Cruz a “basket case.” Rubio notoriously jumped in the sandbox but lacked Trump’s talent — if you want to call it that — for making his zingers stick. Those moments should be instructive to Clinton, Democrats say, and serve as a warning that she should not rush into a war of words with the pioneer of put-downs. “She has to be unafraid,” said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. “He’s a bully; he can’t help himself. I don’t know how he’s going to use a teleprompter in a debate situation. And he can’t control himself. His attention span is nonexistent.” Yet implicit in Reid’s comments is what is expected of Trump by Democrats: very little. And low expectations could be damaging on a debate night that will set the tone for a six-week sprint toward Election Day. Though Trump has been less bombastic over the past month, he’s still making headlines on a daily basis, whether by suggesting that Clinton’s Secret Service detail be disarmed or taking credit for predicting recent terrorist attacks in New York. Given the freewheeling nature of presidential debates, Democrats hope voters will see the vintage Trump that’s been partly concealed in recent weeks. “Expectations have been exceptionally low for Trump. I think that’s why in large part he has gotten away with it,” said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). “If 150 million people are suddenly glued to their TV sets … they are going to be expecting to see the conduct of who they would want in a future president.” “He’ll do it himself,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). “There’s never been a time where he’s talked for longer than 30 seconds where he’s managed to say anything. He just says nothing. He’ll say the same empty phrases over and over again, and I think it will become obvious after an hour and a half.” The debate performances of Clinton and Trump are the subject of much chatter among Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have watched the race tighten after a summer surge by Clinton. When Clinton last visited with Senate Democrats in July, she remarked to the room that she has gotten more advice on debates than any other topic. “Everybody in the room laughed, because most of us had given her advice on what to do,” recounted Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). There’s no constituency that will benefit more from a strong Clinton performance than Democrats desperately trying to take back the Senate this fall. They probably need a healthy Clinton victory to flip a minimum of four seats needed to recapture the chamber. And Clinton needs a strong debate performance to reassert the clear upper hand in the race. “Of course it’s important; she’s the head of the ticket. The better she does, [the better] we do,” Reid said. “She’s been a successful debater in the race we had with Obama. And she’s been good in the primaries with [Sen. Bernie Sanders] screaming and yelling at her all the time.” Democrats are counting on Clinton to not just wait for Trump to stumble; she also has to make an affirmative case to undecided voters, they say. That means contrasting her detailed plans for health care, the minimum wage and immigration with Trump’s more broad-brush stands on many issues. “I don’t think that the question is about attacking Trump at this point. It’s about pointing out her vision for the country,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). “People vote not only on who they oppose, but they want to vote for something.” Trump bragged on Fox News this week that he has the “strongest” temperament. But Democrats are betting the 90-minute showdown will reveal the opposite. “It’s important for people to see this side of him that is very much unpresidential and out of control,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.). “It’s temperament, as much as anything. People want to trust that their president … is in control.”",1,0,0
1478,"Some athletes have taken to pulling ridiculous stunts during games to show their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. But not Cam Newton — the Carolina Panthers quarterback lives in Charlotte and is seeing firsthand the damage these “protests” are causing his community. The riots have caused widespread damage, multiple police officers have been injured and at least one person has been killed. And Newton has had enough. He held a press conference to comment on the riots in Charlotte and criticized the black community’s response to the recent shooting of a black man by police, which is what spawned the riots. “I’m an African American. I’m not happy what or how justice has been dealt with over the years — the state of oppression in our community,” he said. “But we also as black people have to do right by ourselves, we can’t be hypocrites.” He also slammed the violence of the rioters. “When you get a person who does some unjust things or killing an innocent person, killing fathers, killing people who have actual families, that’s real,” he explained. “I have a son. And a daughter I’m responsible for. And how they feel if one day they come home and there’s no more daddy? We need people to be held accountable is that’s all.” Newton also criticized the Black Lives Matter protesters for focusing too much on race. “It doesn’t matter the race,” he said. “I don’t see that through a black/white lens. I could look at you and be around you and I can tell if you’re a good person. There’s good people that doesn’t have a badge on, there’s good people that has a badge on.”   Police aren’t all bad, Newton also claimed, something that likely infuriated the Black Lives Matter protesters. “We all know people who are in the police department. And we also know bad people that’s civilians, and just bad people who are police officers. That’s just life as a whole,” he said. “We all have to as United States citizens, just have to [be] accountable for what we do.” But it was what he said about the black community that likely truly infuriated the rioters. “When you look at the most dangerous cities in America. You know Atlanta, Birmingham, Chicago, Miami, Louisiana,” he explained, “I know from being a black person there’s a lot black people who don’t do right by black people, so you can’t be a hypocrite and say, ‘Oh well, a white man or a white police officer just killed a black man.'”   It’s the kind of common sense outlook that more people need to have.

967,"NEWARK, N.J. — Gov. Chris Christie was told of the George Washington Bridge lane closures as they were occurring in 2013, a federal prosecutor told jurors on Monday in U.S. District Court. David Wildstein, who has already pleaded guilty to playing a role in the incident, and Bill Baroni, who is now on trial for his alleged role in the scheme, “bragged” about the traffic gridlock that lane closures were causing when they spoke with the Republican governor at a Sept. 11 memorial in Lower Manhattan, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna said. Story Continued Below The two Christie-appointed former Port Authority officials mentioned the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, whom they are accused of trying to punish after he refused to endorse Christie’s reelection campaign, the prosecutor said. “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan that, during the precious moments they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned,” Khanna told jurors during his opening remarks Monday morning. Khanna did not elaborate on what was allegedly said during the conversation with Christie, but he told jurors that “evidence in this case may show that others could have, should have, perhaps knew certain aspects of what was going on.” Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie’s former deputy chief of staff, were indicted in May 2015 on charges of conspiracy, fraud and civil rights violations. Christie, who is currently a top adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has denied any knowledge or involvement in the lane-closing incident. And an ostensibly independent report commissioned by Christie said, referring to a much publicized picture of Christie and Wildstein chatting at a public event three days into the manufactured traffic jams at the bridge, that there was “no evidence we have seen that the Governor and Wildstein actually had any substantive discussion of the Fort Lee lane realignment at that public event.” Wildstein, a sharp-elbowed political operator who was a boyhood schoolmate of Christie, has already implicated the two others and will testify during the trial. The trial is expected to last six weeks. The allegation that Christie was told about the George Washington Bridge Fort Lee access lane closings as they were happening doesn’t exactly contradict the governor's own words. But the prosecution's version of the incident does not square with the governor’s own claims, or with the report on Bridgegate produced by the outside firm hired by the Christie administration. The allegation that the lane closings were mentioned to Christie at a 9/11 commemoration ceremony in Lower Manhattan in 2013 is not new. But that 2014 report by the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher — commissioned by Christie and paid for with millions in taxpayer funds — not only denied evidence of a ""substantive"" discussion, but also said, “It seems incredible that, in a public setting leading up to a 9/11 Memorial event, surrounded by other government officials and scores of constituents seeking photographs and handshakes, anything substantive or inculpatory would have been discussed."" The report went on to say that “even if credited, any passing reference by Wildstein made in a social, public setting at the time of a public 9/11 Memorial event to traffic issue in Fort Lee would not have been meaningful or memorable to the Governor” and that Christie “recalls no such exchange.” The prosecution's statement that Wildstein and Baroni bragged to the governor about what they had done runs directly counter to any characterization of the verbal update as a ""passing reference"" and makes it harder to imagine the exchange as one the governor could possibly fail to recall. Baroni’s attorney, Michael Baldassare, told jurors during his opening statement that Wildstein — the government’s star witness — told prosecutors that other officials played a role in the alleged scheme. “David Wildstein implicated so many people in this activity that it will boggle your mind,” Baldassare said. “They’re people at the highest levels of government in New Jersey, and at the very top of the Port Authority.” At one point, Baldassare called Wildstein a “ventriloquist’s doll, sitting on Christopher J. Christie’s lap.” While Baldassare said his client had no hand in shutting down the lanes or covering up the incident, he spent much of his time with the jury focused on Wildstein, whom he said the governor’s office had sent to keep an eye on Baroni. Baldassare worked to impeach Wildstein’s reputation, even cursing his name and apologizing before doing so. He repeatedly called Wildstein a liar, saying he lied under oath before the grand jury that handed up the indictment in the case. “David Wildstein is a vicious guy,” Baldassare said, referring to comments he said former coworkers of Wildstein had made about him. “He’s a bully. I’m sorry judge, everyone — he’s an asshole. He’s a horrible person. He’s the most complicated person I’ve ever met. He is a vindictive individual who would destroy your life.” “He had a twisted mind,” he added, again referring to others. “He’s maniacal. I apologize, again — David Wildstein is a miserable prick. The governor referred to David Wildstein as his fixer. His fixer. And the governor used to joke that David Wildstein was his Mr. Wolf. Mr. Wolf from the movie ‘Pulp Fiction.’” The character, played by actor Harvey Keitel in the Quentin Tarantino film, was an underworld fixer who helped two of the movie’s main characters dispose of a body. At an appearance at a town hall event in Morris County, Christie avoided reporters' questions about the trial. Linh Tat contributed to this report. UPDATE: After this story was published, Baldassare emailed to say that some of the derogatory comments he made about Wildstein during the trial were quotes from people Wildstein had once worked with. The story has been modified to reflect that.",1,0,0

1493,"It would be foolish to pretend that all police officers are upstanding professionals. Just like any profession, there are many, many dedicated professionals and yes, there are some bad ones as well. Police officers are people and sometimes they make mistakes and sometimes they’re just plain bad people of low moral character.   However, in a profession that requires people to literally put their lives on the line for the good of society, I feel comfortable asserting that while there are some bad apples to be found, the vast, vast majority of police officers in America are dedicated professionals worthy of respect and who should be offered a degree of freedom from unnecessarily second-guessing life-and-death decisions that must occur in a millisecond. But don’t tell that to the Congressional Black Caucus… The caucus is demanding that radicalized and openly-corrupted Attorney General Loretta Lynch step in to target police officers to help prevent officers throughout the country from reacting with deadly force to black men and women who pose immediate dangers. Of course, the caucus does not frame the discussion in exactly that way, but that is the effort all the same. Referring to recent high-profile killings of armed black men posing immediate dangers to police officers, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-CA, read the letter to the Attorney General outside the Department of Justice as the adoring media dutifully nodded in agreement. “The world is watching and we cannot continue to ignore these killings,” she grandstanded with the caucus standing in solidarity. The letter urges Lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children.” Of course, such a demand seems reasonable… if they’re truly innocent people. However, in many recent high-profile cases of blacks being killed by officers of varying ethnicities, the quickly-fabricated narrative concerning the conduct of the deceased radically differs from the reality of the situation that emerges after radicalized social justice warriors have already furthered a fictitious narrative that supports their manipulative media narrative.

Yapias, 50, known as Adolfo Tony Yapias-Delgado, was formally charged in the 3rd District Monday with rape, a first-degree felony and evidence tampering, a class A misdemeanor.

According to court documents Yapias went to the woman’s home in South Salt Lake on March 21. “The victim had terminated the relationship 10 days prior and had expressed strongly and repeatedly in text messages that the relationship was over and she did not want anything to do with the defendant,” court documents state. Documents indicate that Yapias persisted and went to her home. “…The victim’s last text to the defendant, before he arrived at her home said: ‘I said no. don’t you get it.’ The defendant responded with a series of three text messages as follows: ‘No, I don’t get it,’ then ‘I’ll be there’ followed a short time later by ‘I’m here,’” It appears Yapias wasn’t concerned about any borders or rights of people not to be harassed.

999,"House Republicans already struggling to protect their historic majority this fall are confronting a multimillion-dollar shortfall in their campaign budget — driven partly by Freedom Caucus members and other hard-line conservatives who are boycotting the GOP’s campaign arm. A bloc of conservatives is refusing to transfer cash to the National Republican Congressional Committee, convinced the committee is favoring moderate candidates over hard-line conservatives. Dozens of other Republican lawmakers also haven’t paid their expected party “dues,” including several in tough primaries or general election races who figure they need the money for themselves. Story Continued Below Several GOP sources told Politico that 3 in 10 members of the House Republican Conference are delinquent on their dues. And multiple senior Republicans said the shortfall exceeds $10 million. “There’s a group of us who associate the NRCC with the establishment wing of the party,” said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who added that he has a “principled objection to paying dues to the NRCC.” The Freedom Caucus member noted that a former top NRCC staffer helped outside groups unseat his friend, Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, in a Republican primary last month, and said the committee is partly to blame. (The NRCC doesn’t spend money in Republican primaries and says it has no control over outside groups.) Mulvaney also says he’s still upset by ads aired against him in early 2015 by American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) allied with then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). The spots implored Mulvaney and other conservatives to end their blockade of a spending bill backed by leadership. After that, several other Freedom Caucus members stopped paying dues. “There’s a group that’s still smarting from the fact some of our own went after us, and we’ll be damned if we’re going to put money back in their hands,” Mulvaney said. The dispute, which one chief of staff for a House Republican called a “brewing war,” is another sign that the schism between the activist and establishment wings of the House GOP Conference has spread to the campaign trail. Over the summer, conservative- and establishment-aligned outside groups poured millions into primary showdowns between far-right and center-right candidates. Now it’s continuing in the general election, as Republicans are struggling to head off double-digit seat losses with Donald Trump leading their ticket. The refusal by conservatives to pay has enraged some House Republicans, who say the NRCC and leadership have no control over outside groups. They also note that the NRCC helped many of the nonpaying members get elected in the first place. “Politics is a team game and outside of the HFC, almost every member of the Republican Conference is busting his or her ass to raise money and get Republicans elected,” said one senior Republican. “The HFC has chosen not to raise money or help get other Republicans elected, but for some reason they think they should control what the NRCC does or how it spends its money? That’s nuts.” While the NRCC has about $2.5 million more cash on hand than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats outraised Republicans by more than $11 million combined in July and August. A big chunk of the disparity is attributable to members not paying dues, several Republican sources said. The NRCC would not comment on the dues figures provided to Politico. It downplayed the conservative boycott, saying in a statement that “we are always very grateful to our Conference for their commitment to ensuring we maintain and grow our historic Republican House majority.” But the problem appears to be serious enough that GOP leaders have pleaded with members several times in recent weeks to pony up. On a conference call with dozens of members the last week of August, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and NRCC Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) urged lawmakers to donate. Walden said Republicans were getting outraised by Democrats in both big and small donations, and Ryan said he was disappointed in members who hadn’t paid their dues, encouraging them to work as a team. And at a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week, Ryan and his top lieutenants told members they need to meet their assessments to close the fundraising gap with the Democrats. A PowerPoint presentation highlighted members who were current on dues and those who hadn’t paid, according to sources in the room. Multiple lawmakers and staffers also told Politico the NRCC is cracking down on members who haven’t paid, even barring some from accessing committee resources or attending events until they do pay. One mid-August NRCC email to Republican chiefs of staff invited them to a reception on a rooftop terrace in downtown Washington, but only for “chiefs of members who have completed their assessments.” The same goes with lawmakers: Country band Big & Rich headlined NRCC’s second annual “house party” last week at The Hamilton restaurant in D.C. But emails inviting lawmakers in early September noted that “only members who are paid in full” on their dues can attend. Dues are based on ability to pay, factoring in a member’s committee assignments and seniority. Getting politicians to fork over their hard-raised cash is a recurring problem for the NRCC and DCCC. But the shortfall this year is especially pressing for Republicans — and increasingly appears to be based on ideological rivalries. A former NRCC staffer defended the committee, saying “many in the House Freedom Caucus would not be there if not for the NRCC.” The committee spent $1 million help elect Mulvaney in 2010, the person said, among other caucus members who’ve benefited from the committee’s largesse. At the crux of the conservatives’ boycott is a belief the NRCC is now supporting moderates who back the party’s leadership against conservatives who push the party further to the right. “When those folks are going against us … would I support that with my money? No,” said Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a Freedom Caucus member who upset Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary two years ago. Some conservatives, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), have instead decided to transfer money to right-leaning candidates they personally support. If those contenders win the GOP primary, it could mean more influence for conservatives. Conservatives also suspect that leadership and the NRCC are behind outside establishment-aligned groups targeting the far right of the conference. When asked about NRCC dues, Brat said it’s “illogical for me to fund ads against myself” — though the NRCC does not directly play in primaries. Many conservatives are still furious with AAN for the round of ads they ran in early 2015 — though the Freedom Caucus did not take an official position on the matter. AAN told POLITICO they have spent multiple times the amount of money on positive ads for some for these same members since early 2015, including 10 times in Mulvaney's case. “I’m not sure how you use issue advocacy ads run for one day 18 months ago as an excuse not to pay political dues,"" said Mike Shields, president of American Action Network. GOP leaders have told conservatives countless times they’re not trying to undercut them in campaigns, arguing they have no control over groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that might decide to target a conservative in a primary. Allies of leadership and the NRCC also note that one of the Freedom Caucus’ strongest outside allies, the conservative Club for Growth, has actively gone after sitting lawmakers, including Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.). Others Republicans have been slow to contribute because they’re afraid for themselves. Several lawmakers or top staffers for lawmakers who’ve faced tough primaries said the NRCC doesn’t help them when they’re challenged by fellow Republicans. “They want you to give a lot of money, but it weakens you in defending yourself in the primary, and for us, the primary is where we live and die now,” said the chief of staff for one member who no longer pays his dues. In the meantime, top House Republicans are donating millions above their dues assessments to compensate for the shortfall. Ryan, for example, has transferred nearly $30 million alone. An altar call during last Tuesday’s GOP conference meeting, for example, brought more than $3 million, including $1.5 million from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, $500,000 from House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, $250,000 from Budget Chairman Tom Price of Georgia and $200,000 from Walden, sources in the room say. Leaders were hoping to inspire more transfers. It’s unclear so far whether they’ve succeeded.",1,0,0
353,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offered vastly different proposals Wednesday to change police practices following fatal shootings of African-American men in Oklahoma and North Carolina. When asked how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump said he would take the controversial stop-and-frisk practice nationwide. ""I think you have to,"" the Republican nominee said at a town hall with Fox News host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" Civil liberties groups have blasted the practice as targeting minorities and some investigators have questioned its effectiveness. Trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach Meanwhile, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said the Democratic nominee plans to develop national standards for police intended to ""prevent situations like this."" Speaking on CNN's ""New Day,"" Mook said Clinton wants to ""restore bonds between communities and law enforcement."" That, he said, would involve ""investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the relationships in the community to prevent something like this from happening."" The candidates -- just days away from their first in-person clash on the debate stage -- were also far apart on the underlying causes of the shootings. Clinton connected police shootings to ""systemic racism"" while Trump suggested the officer in Oklahoma ""choked."" Comments carry weight This is not the first time Trump or Clinton have addressed police shootings during this lengthy campaign season. But as the race nears its conclusion in less than two months, their comments carry even more weight. And the stakes are especially high since one of the shootings occurred in North Carolina, a critical swing state with a sizable African-American population that both campaigns are working hard to reach. Trump and Clinton hit the campaign trail following an evening of protests and occasional violence in Charlotte after police killed Keith Lamont Scott in an apartment complex parking lot as officers looked for another man named in a warrant they were trying to serve. That followed the fatal shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week after his car was found abandoned in the middle of the road. Trump 'very troubled' by Oklahoma fatal police shooting Clinton addressed the shootings in a speech in Orlando, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon. ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" She said she's spoken with law enforcement leaders ""who are as deeply concerned as I am, and as deeply committed as I am to reform."" And, she said, she's spoken with mothers whose children have been killed, ""and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable."" ""We've got to do better. And I know we can. And if I'm elected president, we will. And we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done,"" Clinton said. Trump tweeted calls for unity following the violence in Charlotte. His comment during the Fox town hall that the female officer involved in the Tulsa shooting might have ""choked"" was notable considering he typically emphasizes support for law enforcement officers. But Trump said he'd seen the widely circulated video of the incident in Tulsa. ""That man went to the car, hands up -- put his hands on the car,"" Trump said. ""To me it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do. And he looked like a really good man."" Christie vs. Clinton Meanwhile, one of Trump's top supporters -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- lambasted Clinton for her response on conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham's show. In a radio interview Tuesday, Clinton had cited the need to address ""systemic racism"" and ""implicit bias"" in police forces -- while praising ""honorable, cool-headed police officers."" 2016: Last call for working class whites? Christie labeled those remarks a ""disgrace"" Wednesday. ""She's a disgrace. She's a disgrace and those comments are a disgrace,"" Christie said Wednesday on ""The Laura Ingraham Show."" ""It's typical of Hillary Clinton. She knows nothing but the mouth never stops."" Trump, however, has also displayed a tendency to speak about events before all the facts are made clear. He notably called the explosion in New York City over the weekend a ""bomb"" 30 minutes after the incident, despite a lack of official confirmation. African-American outreach The shootings come as Trump and Clinton confront unique challenges with African-American voters. Clinton's weakness is among millennial voters across the board -- many of whom have told pollsters they are gravitating toward Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to chip into Clinton's commanding lead among African-American voters overall while also appealing to white voters who tend to support the GOP but have been turned off by his rhetoric. That effort hit turbulence Wednesday when Trump campaigned alongside long-time boxing promoter Don King Wednesday in Ohio. King, who is black, used the N-word while introducing Trump, arguing that African-Americans cannot achieve success while emulating whites because they will remain ""negroes."" ""If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding n***** -- I mean negro -- you are a dancing and sliding and gliding negro,"" King said, laughing along with the crowd after the slip-up. ""You're going to be a negro 'til you die."" The political history of Don King Trump also caused controversy Tuesday night when he told a nearly all-white crowd in North Carolina that ""we're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before.

1469,"What is going on with the NFL? What has happened to America’s greatest sport? The ratings have plummeted as of late, though definitely not enough to make any lasting damage…that is until fans get completely fed up with the anti-cop attitude and 44% of them decide to boycott…but that’s just talk, right?  Well that’s the word on the street and if it does happen you can thank Colin Kaepernick and the number of other players who are protesting racial injustice by refusing to stand for the National Anthem, or raising the Black Power fist, idiotically not knowing what that symbol means. Let’s see what the feckless Roger Goodell has planned when the people who line these player’s and the owner’s pockets with cash, completely abandon these creeps.  There’s a recent poll going around that reveals that 44% of fans would actually go through with the threat. Now this is an internet poll, so take it with a grain of salt…just saying. It’s going to be a good time to see if they actually have any conviction. According to the poll, there could be a number of factors. Some stated the absence of Brady and Peyton was enough to get them to stop watching the games, while a healthy third of the poll said that the actions of Colin Kaepernick played a major role in their decision to not watch.   With further riots happening after recent police shootings, it won’t take that much to believe that the kneeling isn’t going to stop anytime soon. But how long can it go on? To what end is all this going? What’s the endgame for these knee jerk reactions to police shootings? Whatever it is, Roger Goodell is going to have to make a decision. Is he going to bring the fist down and fine players each time they disrespect our country? Or is he going to go along with the PC culture… My money’s on the latter. ",0,0,1

You would think that this would be covered extensively by all of the Major News Networks, wouldn’t you? Perhaps these attacks have been caused by a video. I am sure Hillary Clinton would like you to believe that Donald Trump is personally responsible for the current bout of jihad in the USA. She has come awfully close to implying it. These attacks couldn’t be caused by Obama’s failed immigration policies Oh NO NO NO; the same policies that Hillary promises to administer full speed ahead. Perhaps the Media is downplaying these tragedies in order to prevent a shadow of blame being cast on Crooked Hillary. CNN, MSN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and even FOX would never ever be used as a propaganda machine to prop up Crooked Hillary, would they? What kind of DEPLORABLE person could doubt the credibility of today’s American Media? What happened to America? The news I watch today is twisted into propaganda resembling the propaganda that was dished out to citizens of the Soviet Union; they tell us twisted versions of the news containing enough grain of truth to fool the sheep.

Students at Ramapo College were recently forced to change the theme of an “American BBQ” because the administration deemed it too “offensive.” According to emails obtained by Campus Reform, Ariana Rivera, the Assistant Residence Director of Bischoff Hall, sent an email to the College Republicans and the College Democrats on August 17 inviting the groups to co-sponsor an American-themed BBQ with Bischoff and Mackin Halls. The proposal called for the CRs and CDs to run tables for their respective organizations at the event, as well as encouraging students to register to vote, and CR President Taylor Gilson responded almost immediately to affirm that her group would participate.  However, on September 14, just two days before the scheduled event, Rivera wrote to Gilson, again, this time regretfully explaining that Bischoff Hall would no longer be co-sponsoring with the CRs because the American theme was “considered offensive.” Rivera subsequently reported that the event would not be entirely cancelled, after all, but that it would have to be a… Read the rest of the story at Campus Reform  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",0,0,1
298,"Washington (CNN)The top Republican on the Senate's homeland security committee wants the Department of Homeland Security to hand over its records on the suspects in this weekend's bombings in New York and New Jersey and an unrelated stabbing in Minnesota. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sent a letter Tuesday to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson asking for information on Dahir Adan, alleged to have stabbed 10 people in a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Ahmad Khan Rahami, alleged to have planted improvised explosive devices in New York and New Jersey. Johnson also asked for information about Rahami's wife, Asia Bibi Rahami, a Pakistani national who has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Father says he warned FBI The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chairman asked the secretary for the alien files, records of foreign travel, visa applications and citizen applications for the two men and immigration, visa and travel records for Rahami's wife. ""It is important for Congress to learn more about these individuals in order to understand and evaluate the department's efforts to counter homegrown radical extremism,"" Johnson wrote. The senator told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that the request for information is about putting pieces together. ""I've sent a letter to secretary of DHS Jeh Johnson. I want to see the alien file, I want to know everything we can found out about Mr. Rahami as well as Mr. Adan,"" Johnson said. ""And we've just got to try to piece things together. But Wolf, we are not fighting a winning battle here when we're dealing with these inspired lone wolfs."" Rahami is a naturalized citizen who came to the states from Afghanistan. He traveled at length to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Adan was Somali and was killed by an off-duty police officer during the attack. ",1,0,0
70,"The two fatal police shootings that occurred in Tulsa and Charlotte recently have prompted a renewed focus on what police may be able to do to help prevent future such incidents. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have discussed their proposals for law enforcement on the campaign trail.    The Democratic nominee has laid out two specific steps for bring change within law enforecment. The first would be to call on law enforcement and communities to ""develop national guidelines on the use of force by police officers,"" Clinton said in a speech about her plan on July 8, 2016, the day after five police officers were ambushed and killed during a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas. The protest was held in the wake of fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Minnesota. ""We’ll make it clear for everyone to see when deadly force is warranted, and when it isn’t,"" Clinton said in her speech, which was before the general conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The second step would be to ""acknowledge that implicit bias still exists across our society and even in the best police departments"" and commit $1 billion to fund new training programs and support research, she said. ""We do need police and criminal justice reforms, to save lives and make sure all Americans are treated equally in rights and dignity,"" Clinton said in the speech, her most extensive talk yet on the issue of policing. ""We do need to support police departments and stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect us. We do need to reduce gun violence. We may disagree about how to go about these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises. Her plan specifically focuses on ""reducing excessive violence, reforming our sentencing laws, supporting police departments that are doing things right, and making it harder for the wrong people to get their hands on guns,"" she said. Clinton had also previously spoken about the need to end racial profiling. In October, her team noted that she plans to support legislation banning racial profiling on federal, state and law enforcement levels. She co-sponsored similar acts while she was in the Senate.    The Republican nominee, unlike Clinton, has given no speeches that specifically focus on his plans regarding law enforcement tactics. Instead, the self-anointed ""law-and-order candidate"" has made passing remarks on several law enforcement topics at different times. He has said that police need ""better training,"" as evidenced by certain shootings. ""Even when they wear cameras police wear the cameras you need training. You have to have training. You have to have better training obviously than what they have,"" he said during an interview with the Impact Network in September. Most recently, Trump said controversial ""stop-and-frisk"" practices that were previously used in New York City would be a way to end violence in the black community. The morning after mentioning this during a town hall with voters in Cleveland on Sept. 21, Trump said he didn't mean stop-and-frisk should be implemented nationally, but only in Chicago because ""Chicago is out of control."" Trump has also mentioned that mosques should be under surveillance, though he has wavered on the topic. He has also suggested that old military gear should be handed over to police departments, but did not go into detail. In the wake of the bombings last weekend in New York City and New Jersey, Trump said police should be allowed to profile, though his son Donald Trump Jr. later took issue with it being called ""racial profiling."" ""They see somebody that's suspicious, they will profile,"" the candidate said on Fox News on Monday. ""Look what's going on: Do we really have a choice? We're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse."" ABC News' Liz Kreutz, Josh Haskell, John Santucci and Candace Smith contributed to this report.",1,0,0

1564,"Everyone knows Arnold Palmer as being a spectacular golfer and the inventor of a drink that is a mix of lemonade and iced tea. (I personally thank him for the last one, because I am in love with Arnold Palmers, especially in the summer months.)  Aside from being a great athlete, Palmer was also a great American, as evidenced by his comments about the Star Spangled Banner. “We don’t play ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ enough during the matches, and that is one of the things I think we need to do,” Palmer said then. “It’s a patriotic situation, and it belongs to both sides,” Palmer added. These comments came after the National Football League saw the beginning of the sitting protests that have sparked so much outrage. This weekend, we saw DeSean Jackson of the Washington Redskins greet our National Anthem with a raised fist, which is being used as a symbol of solidarity with the black community. He later made a statement on Instagram: “No matter how much or what we stand 4 as black people this will continue to happen , another Love 1 is taking from his family and killed unarmed , when will this s— stop , this man was shot & killed for what ??

Later, he questioned whether these gestures on the field are actually being turned into actions. “Does anybody want to resolve the issues? That’s what we have to find out,” said running back Rashad Jennings. “We’re talking about gestures. The gesture of taking a knee, the gesture of posting something (on social media). Those are all gestures. It’s whether the actions are taking place,” he said.

1201,"The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity. But the ""he said/she said"" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the ""he said/she"" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the ""he said/she said"" critics. Story Continued Below While I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the ""he said/she said"" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for? In his widely applauded critiques of ""he said/she said"" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The ""he said/she said"" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark. Donald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the ""he said/she said"" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes. But has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, ""he said/she said"" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it. As bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both ""he said and she said""—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from. One reason I admire ""he said/she said"" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the ""she-said"" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the ""she-said"" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories? I don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard. The history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a ""she-said"" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes. Or consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories. Obviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on. The dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.” Before anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots. The last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the ""he said"" side of the story or just the ""she said"" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.” If you’re not getting a steady diet of ""she said"" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. ""He said/she said"" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump. ****** A sumptuous meal of news, news, news.

1025,"Targeting voters hesitant to embrace Republican Donald Trump in traditionally deep-red Utah, Hillary Clinton’s campaign launched “Mormons for Hillary” on Tuesday. The group’s launch, first reported by the Salt Lake Tribune, is the latest move by Clinton’s campaign in Utah, a state that has not gone in favor of a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. The former secretary of state opened a campaign office in Salt Lake City last month and has published an op-ed in the Deseret News, a newspaper owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Story Continued Below The group announced nearly 120 members, some of which have been lifelong Republicans. ""In 2016, the Republican Party's candidate for president — my party — is belittling and scapegoating people of other religious and ethnic minorities in the harshest language,"" retired brigadier general and former Davis County, Utah, Republican Party chair David Irvine told the Tribune. ""His disdain for them is equaled only by his disdain and crudity toward women. The most enduring pioneer value is charity in its broadest sense, and Utahns looking for those kinds of values should be reading [Clinton's book] 'It Takes a Village' — and voting for Hillary Clinton."" Trump himself has admitted that he is “having a tremendous problem in Utah.” While Trump has tapped into veins of support with religious voters around the country, reliably-Republican Mormons have been slow to embrace the Manhattan billionaire. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, perhaps the most well-known Mormon in political circles, has said he will not support Trump and in March delivered a speech condemning him. In particular, Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. has made him a tough sell for Mormon voters whose church has a history of facing persecution. Trump has since backed away from that proposal in favor of one that restricts immigration from countries affected by terrorism, but his earlier proposal damaged him with Utah voters. In June, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) attacked Trump as well, noting that Trump’s “religiously intolerant” rhetoric makes him unattractive to Utahans “in part because my state consists of people who are members of a religious minority church. A people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1838. And, statements like that make them nervous.”",1,0,0
1356,"Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain will vote to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation that would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia — defying warnings from military officials that it could put U.S. troops at risk. McCain’s decision to back the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act is also a notable break from his usual hawkish allies on the Capitol. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas has circulated a letter urging Republicans to sustain Obama’s veto, while close friend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also voiced concerns and worked behind the scenes on potential tweaks to the bill — but with little success. Story Continued Below “I plan to vote to override the president’s veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,” McCain said in a statement to POLITICO. “Going forward, I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that American military, intelligence, and diplomatic personnel are protected from any potential retaliatory lawsuits and that the implementation of this law is true to its narrow intent.” Earlier Tuesday, McCain had declined to say where he could come down on the JASTA vote scheduled in the Senate for Wednesday, noting: “I have got to look at what the alternatives are.” McCain’s statement adds to the air of inevitability on Capitol Hill surrounding the 9/11 bill, which was formally vetoed by Obama last week but is expected to easily clinch the two-thirds support from Congress needed to override a presidential veto. It would be Obama’s first veto successfully overridden by Congress. Still, top Obama administration officials have tried to exert last-minute pressure on lawmakers to help sustain Obama’s veto. For instance, Secretary of State John Kerry has had several conversations with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has been one of the senators most skeptical of the bill. Gen. Joe Dunford, the top U.S. military official, weighed in Tuesday with a letter, obtained by POLITICO, outlining his concerns for U.S. service members and “risks to the close security cooperation relationships” with allies. And Defense Secretary Ash Carter fired off another warning to Congress, arguing that legislation has “potentially harmful consequences for the Department of Defense and its personnel.” ""While we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the department and its service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad,"" Carter wrote in the letter, obtained by POLITICO. On Tuesday, McCain’s Democratic counterpart on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, acknowledged the administration's concerns. “I’m looking closely at two significant issues,” Reed said. “One is that the families are looking not for any type of award, they’re looking for accountability as much as anything else. On the other side, is the real possibility this will be used against us and our troops and servicemen, and I’m trying to balance that.” McCain’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, also plans to vote to override Obama’s veto, she said in a statement earlier this month. Kirkpatrick’s campaign has also raised Saudi Arabia as a campaign issue. As the Senate debated a vote to block a Saudi arms sale last week, her campaign accused McCain of having ties to the Saudi government through a donation to the McCain Institute. Even lawmakers who have voiced concerns say there is little question the Senate is set to easily override Obama’s veto. Corker and Graham had started to discuss a potential change to the legislation that would narrow its scope to just the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to congressional sources. Right now, JASTA applies to any foreign government found liable for terrorism conducted on U.S. soil – although the main target of the legislation has largely been viewed as Saudi Arabia and its alleged role in the terror attacks 15 years ago. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Speaking with reporters, Corker said limiting JASTA to just Sept. 11 victims was the “easiest” way to narrow the legislation, but it was still facing opposition from JASTA supporters. He predicted that lawmakers may push to pass a legislative fix to the 9/11 bill in the lame-duck session, after observing any potential “blowback” the United States ends up facing from foreign governments over the next several weeks. “This isn’t to me about Saudi Arabia,” Corker said. “It’s the blowback to us because we’re the most involved in the world. You end up exporting your foreign policy to trial lawyers, right? … What you’re really doing here is potentially exporting big issues to trial lawyers away from our own abilities as a government to conduct foreign policy. That’s an issue.” Though the veto override appears like a done deal, there was a clear and palpable sense of buyer’s remorse percolating among key lawmakers as the Senate barreled toward the key vote on Wednesday. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that he himself was a co-sponsor of JASTA. Still, that wasn’t stopping him from having second thoughts as the prospect of the legislation turning into law became a reality. “I’m worried about getting into a tremendous legal morass that can really cost this country, not just locally but by other countries across the world,” Hatch said. “I have to say, I don’t think we had enough time to consider all the ramifications. There are a lot of ramifications.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also reiterated her concerns: “The more I think from an intelligence perspective, it’s the wrong thing to do.” Still, other senators appeared to have little change of heart ahead of the high-profile vote on Wednesday. “The vote passed overwhelmingly here in the Senate and the House,” said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). “I supported it at the time. I haven’t seen anything that would change my mind.”",1,0,0
870,"The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s Trump coverage. Executive editor Dean Baquet” said that “I think our investigative work—see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.” Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue. But it appears that Trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.",0,1,0
508,"(CNN)The circus of politics can often be a distraction from actual policy -- and last night's debate proved no exception when it came to the subject of foreign affairs. The back and forth between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was perhaps more instructive in terms of what was not mentioned -- Syria's civil war, for instance -- than what was discussed. To be fair, the debate was not intended to focus on international issues, which were basically a footnote in the ""securing America"" segment. But amid the exchanges about ISIS, Iran, NATO and nuclear proliferation, there were some brief glimpses of what the world might look like under a President Trump or a President Clinton. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? Fighting ISIS For the most part, Trump focused on attacking Clinton's record -- ""she's got experience, but it's bad experience"" -- rather than on articulating his own foreign policy proposals. That was certainly true of the discussion on ISIS, which was mentioned 24 times during the foreign policy part of the debate. Clinton spoke of the need to ""intensify our air strikes against ISIS,"" ""support our Arab and Kurdish partners,"" and ""take out their leadership"" -- positions that don't differ much from President Barack Obama's current policies. MORE: CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims Trump repeatedly slammed Clinton and Obama for contributing to the rise of the terror group by pulling out of Iraq, but he offered no details of his own ""secret"" plan ""to knock the hell out of ISIS.""

(Fact check: ISIS only came into being in 2006 after splintering from al Qaeda in Iraq. Clinton was born in 1947.) Iran's nuclear deal Similarly, on Iran, Trump repeatedly attacked Clinton for striking ""one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history,"" arguing that Iran had been ""about to fall"" and was now poised to become a ""major power."" But he didn't offer many suggestions for how it should have been done differently, beyond suggesting that ""they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places."" MORE: 6 key takeaways from the first debate Support for NATO If the debate didn't offer much new insight into Trump's foreign policy plans, his comments about America's allies and NATO certainly did. ""I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world ... where they're not paying us what we need,"" Trump said. MORE: Trump, Clinton debate nukes, ISIS, hackers It was a moment that will have sent shudders down the spines of America's international allies -- an isolationist vision that has many global leaders wary about a President Trump. Already under Obama, there is a perception that the US has retreated from taking an international leadership role, particularly in the Middle East. Clinton sought to provide some reassurance that she would be different, saying: ""we've got to work more closely with our allies"". But it remains to be seen how she would take on some of the toughest foreign policy questions -- namely, the civil war in Syria -- in a way that would be meaningfully different or more impactful than her predecessor. Perhaps the next debate will offer some more clues. ",1,0,0
1112,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called for a state of emergency in Charlotte Wednesday night after violence escalated as residents continued to protest the fatal shooting of an African-American man by a police officer a day prior. ""I have declared a State of Emergency & initiated efforts to deploy the Nat'l Guard & Highway Patrol to assist local law enforcement in CLT,"" McCrory tweeted late Wednesday night. Story Continued Below Civil unrest surged Tuesday as reports of the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott spread, prompting mass protests that went into the night. A dozen officers were injured during the unrest, according to a tweet from the local police department early Wednesday morning. As protests continued Wednesday, reports emerged of a shooting that left a protester critically wounded, according to the Associated Press. Charlotte officials at first announced the man was dead but later amended the statement to say he was on life support. The police department has said the shooting was not committed by an officer. ""These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,"" McCrory said Wednesday night on CNN shortly after making the announcement. ""We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,"" McCrory added. ""That is not the American way."" The North Carolina governor added that though the state of emergency did not include a curfew, the possibility of one remained ""a very strong option."" According to local reports, police officers saw Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and an officer shot the man.",1,0,0
313,"Kenansville, North Carolina (CNN)Donald Trump thinks black communities in the US are ""absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before."" Trump made the comment as he rallied supporters here on Tuesday and made his usual ""what do you have to lose"" pitch to African-American voters -- few of whom attended his rally in this rural part of this battleground state. ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said to approving nods from the nearly all-white crowd. ""You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. They're worse -- I mean, honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities,"" he continued. ""And I think it's resonating."" His comments came despite the fact that African-Americans in the US have faced dramatically worse circumstances throughout history -- from slavery to Jim Crow laws. President Barack Obama, the first black US president, took on similar assertions by Trump last Saturday while speaking Congressional Black Caucus gala. ""You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,"" Obama had said. ""But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him."" In harsh rebuke of Trump, Obama referred to the businessman as ""somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life."" On Trump's quest to win over African-American voters, Obama quipped: ""Well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid."" The Republican nominee has made a concerted effort to reach out to black voters over the last month, including visiting a predominantly black church in Detroit, and visiting the water plant and a church in the majority-black city of Flint, Michigan. But his visit to Flint was marred in controversy after the church's pastor interrupted Trump to keep him from leveling political attacks. He was also met with hecklers there who called out his record as a landlord in New York, where he faced a civil rights lawsuit from the Justice Department in 1973 -- which Trump settled -- alleging he discriminated against black tenants. Critics have also panned Trump's outreach to African-Americans for painting the lives of black Americans in broad-brushed and bleak terms. Trump has argued that black voters should flock to his candidacy because he will ""fix it"" and has slammed his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for seeing black Americans as votes, not as people -- even though she has a history of championing civil rights issues and more than 9-in-10 African-Americans support Clinton, according to recent polling. Trump's support with African-Americans stands in the low single digits according to recent national polls. Despite his words aimed at drawing black voters to his campaign, Trump on Tuesday did not address the most police recent shooting of an unarmed African-African American man. Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old black man, was shot by police Friday night in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Clinton addressed the shooting earlier Tueaday on ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show,"" calling it ""unbearable"" and arguing for the need to ""tackle systemic racism."" ",1,0,0
184,"If Republicans and Donald Trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up. Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson has outraged the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the House Veterans Affairs Committee by referring to veterans as “moochers” who are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the VA. “Just like workers comp out here’s got moochers, I wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society,” Davidson said during a town hall event on Monday. “But part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they’re clogging up the system, and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the VA filters out these folks that are pretenders. Just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor, but that’s a problem in the vet community, too.” Davidson, who won a special election to replace John Boehner and is a supporter of Donald Trump, has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since. Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis slammed Davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country. “Honorably discharged veterans with service-connected wounds, illnesses and injuries, or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control, are not moochers,” he said in a statement. House Veterans Affairs Committee chairman Jeff Miller said he hopes that Davidson merely “misspoke” and called upon him to clarify his remarks. And Davidson’s remarks are particularly outrageous because Davidson is a veteran himself. But when given the chance to back down, Davidson did the opposite. “Any effort to suggest I have anything other than a soldier’s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest,” he said before his spokesman presented four case of VA fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are “moochers.” The problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans. In other words, the people in these cases are NOT veterans. But Davidson called veterans “moochers” anyway. It would have been so simple for Davidson to just clarify his remarks, but he didn’t because, like Donald Trump, Republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong. So Davidson’s insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how Republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country. ",0,1,0
1198,"For son Eric Trump, Donald Trump will ultimately win over millennials against Hillary Clinton because like Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, the Republican nominee “has been an entrepreneurial guy” who became “the epitome of the American dream.” “He’s gone from nothing into a man who’s just — “ Trump said Friday on Fox News’ “Outnumbered,” as Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky cut him off: “Nothing? He got a million bucks? Come on, Eri c…” Story Continued Below Trump defended his statement, saying his father has “built an unbelievable empire” and has “epitomized what America’s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?” “It’s no different than a Zuckerberg, right?” he continued. “Who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it’s very different than a person who has been a career politician.” The 32-year-old businessman then remarked that “in all fairness” he did not “think millennials relate to policy very well because they haven't lived their lives long enough to understand so many of the issues that influence, I mean in broad stroke of issues, right?” “They obviously understand a lot of issues as it pertains to them. Student debt, and this and that. But I think maybe taxes and things like that might be a little less significant than other issues,” Trump said. “And so I just think there is disconnect between somebody who is constantly talking about, you know, policy and this and that and then a man who built a great company.” As the conversation shifted to the Trump campaign’s social media presence, Eric Trump sought to contrast his father’s approach with that of the Clinton operation. “We're humans that are speaking to that social media platform,” Trump said of his tweets, along with those of his siblings. “Hillary has 100 people who work on her social media team. My father’s has myself. I’ve got myself. I do all my social. I was tweeting as I was walking into the room. I think that’s very, very relevant. Going on to call it “the difference between a robot speaking and a person speaking,” Trump called it “very, very transparent” before mocking the Clinton campaign’s use of “-H” in tweets to signify that the candidate herself sent it. “If you have to put H after a tweet, you're not really communicating to somebody,” Trump said.",1,0,0

Democrats were recently ready to measure the drapes in the White House. But according to Bloomberg Politics, Clinton’s once seemly insurmountable lead has officially “collapsed.” As Bloomberg reports: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are locked in a tied two-way race for the presidency as they head to Hofstra University in New York on Monday night for one of the most highly anticipated debates in modern politics. The Republican and Democratic nominees each get 46 percent of likely voters in a head-to-head contest in the latest Bloomberg Politics national poll, while Trump gets 43 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent when third-party candidates are included. Clinton faces higher expectations as tens of millions of people tune in for a television spectacle that could reach Super Bowl viewership levels. About half, 49 percent, say they anticipate the former secretary of state will perform better, while 39 percent say that for Trump, a real-estate developer and former TV personality And, Hillary has lost support among women and younger Millennial voters: Ann Selzer, the Iowa-based pollster who oversaw the survey, said there are signs that Clinton’s margins with women and young voters have eroded over the past three months, helping to explain Trump’s gains.

415,"Washington (CNN)New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong in his assessment of stop-and-frisk, a policy that allows police officers to stop and pat down individuals they deem suspicious. ""Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts,"" de Blasio told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety."" Trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach ""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" added the mayor, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president. If elected, Trump said Wednesday at a Fox News town hall that he hopes to take the controversial policy nationwide to help stem ""violence in the black community."" ""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to,"" Trump said. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" Trump's comments came in response to an audience member's question about reducing ""black-on-black crime."" But many people in New York's black community have opposed the practice arguing that New York's police disproportionately used the policy to target and harass people of color. After ongoing protests of the policy, a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens' constitutional rights. However, the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice, but called for outside oversight and reform. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated whether New York City is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process. ",1,0,0
1279,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — A composed Hillary Clinton got under Donald Trump’s skin during their high-stakes showdown on Monday night, with the Republican nominee persistently interrupting Clinton as she needled him on his business record, the size of his fortune and his relationship with the truth. For 90 minutes at Hofstra University, Clinton and Trump clashed on style and specifics, disagreeing about foreign policy, economic plans and their readiness for the Oval Office. But for most of the evening, it was Clinton who was driving the agenda. She rattled off crisp prepared lines and repeatedly lured Trump into less politically favorable terrain, including a long discussion of why he was refusing to release his taxes. Story Continued Below “First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is,” Clinton suggested. “Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.” The much-hyped debate opened up with momentary niceties — Trump called her “Secretary Clinton, yes, is that okay?” — and a friendly handshake that briefly masked the tension of a knife’s edge contest that is well within the margin of error in the most crucial swing states. And in an unprecedented moment for presidential politics, the Democratic nominee midway through the debate accused the Republican nominee of racism. “He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,” Clinton said, during an exchange on Trump’s years-long questioning of the American citizenship of President Barack Obama. Trump soon fired back with one of the evening’s most memorable lines. “When you try to act holier than thou it really doesn’t work.” The exchange was emblematic of a debate not deep on substantive policy differences but full of attacks, with both candidates landing blows that will resonate with their established bases of support. “I have a feeling that by the end of this evening I am going to be blamed for everything,” Clinton said with a smile. “Why not?” Trump retorted. “Just join the debate by saying more crazy things,” Clinton shot back. Clinton seemed to gain steam as the debate went on, hitting Trump in the closing minutes for his past attacks objectifying women’s appearances. The former secretary of state often appeared relaxed as Trump scowled and tried to jump in during her answers. Clinton had prepared for weeks for the face-off with Trump, complete with briefing books and mock debates. Trump has eschewed such traditional preparation and, while he landed some of the evening’s most memorable lines, his performance was far more uneven. In one of the debate’s tenser moments, Trump swiped at Clinton’s recent time off the campaign trail when she came down with pneumonia and holed up for debate preparation. “You decided to stay home and that's okay,” Trump said with more than a hint of sarcasm. “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. “And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.” Under sustained attack, Trump did not have a meltdown, even as he misrepresented key elements on his record, including citing opposition to the war in Iraq despite the public record, and insisting that Clinton began raising questions of Obama’s citizenship. Asked about his judgement toward the end of the debate, Trump declared, “I think my strongest asset, maybe by far is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not.” It was the evening’s most talked-about line both on Facebook and Twitter. Throughout, Trump stuck to knocking Clinton as a predictable, talking-point driven, lifelong politician. “Typical politician. All talk. No action. Sounds good. Doesn’t work. Never gonna happen,” Trump said in a staccato summation of his debate plan. In the closing minutes, Trump summarized his appeal again. “Hillary has experience,” Trump said. “But it’s bad experience.” The two candidates sniped about nearly everything from climate change to the economy to ISIS to trade to their records. One of the longest exchanges came not on tax policy — but Trump’s refusal to release his taxes, breaking decades of precedent for presidential candidates. Trump got a rise out of the audience – against the debate’s ground rules of silence from the crowd -- by pledging to release his tax returns if Clinton releases all of the emails her staff deleted from the private email server she used as secretary of state. “I will release my tax returns, against my lawyer's wishes, when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” Trump declared. “So it's negotiable?” moderator Lester Holt asked, with Trump shooting back, “It's not negotiable, no.” Clinton tried to turn the attack on her private email use back on Trump, who had previously said he wouldn’t release his tax returns until a routine audit is completed. “I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns,” Clinton said. Clinton tried to direct viewers to her website for real-time fact-checking of Trump. Trump directed viewers there, too, at one point. “She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MaCarthur would like that too much,” Trump said of the 20thcentury general. “At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,” Clinton said. “No, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” Trump said about a group that has only existed for a few years. Trump didn’t just tangle with Clinton — but with Holt. When Trump said, despite the public record, that he was opposed to the war in Iraq, Holt interjected “The record shows otherwise,” Holt said. “The record shows that I’m right,” Trump said. Back and forth, they went. When Clinton finally got her turn, she exclaimed, “Whew! Okay…” Clinton more than once made accusations that caused Trump to blurt out interruptions, referring to him only by his first name. “Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,” she said. “That’s called business,” Trump jumped in. “Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real,” she said at another point. “I did not say that,” Trump countered. “I did not say that.” And when she hit him for his rhetoric about failing black communities, he sighed audibly. More than anything, Clinton sought to make the evening a referendum on Trump’s truthfulness, even as polls show the public have many questions about her own trustworthiness. “Donald, I know you live in your own reality,” she said to Trump during an exchange about trade, “but that is not the facts.” They went back and forth several times, but Clinton ultimately got the last word.",1,0,0
1498,"Arizona's laws on child molestation are so broad that a parent changing a diaper could be prosecuted for criminal activity. That is the opinion of defense attorney Russ Richelsoph and a minority of judges on the Arizona Supreme Court, according to The Arizona Republic. Child molestation in Arizona is defined as intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a child under the age of 15. Sexual contact is interpreted as “direct or indirect touching, fondling or manipulating” of a child’s genitals or private parts. Unlike other states, the Arizona law does not require there to be an intent to harm, violate or arouse by the alleged perpetrator. In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme court confirmed that proving intent was not necessary. As a result, it ruled that a parent changing a diaper or a physician conducting an examination could be charged with molestation under the current interpretation of the law. “When you have a statute that criminalizes such a broad set of behaviors that everybody’s a criminal, everybody who has changed a diaper, every physician or nurse who has examined the genitals of a child, that’s a huge problem,” defense attorney Russ Richelsoph told The Republic. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery disagreed and believes some common sense has to be observed. “I’m a parent. I have prosecutors who are parents,” Montgomery said. “We know the difference between diapering and molesting a child.” Montgomery said prosecutors handle such cases carefully. “If a defendant is going to bring that up in trial and we don’t have any evidence to show that there was sexual motivation, then juries are not going to convict, grand jurors are not going to indict,” he told KPNX. The court ruling said that changing the law was the responsibility of politicians. “We agree that the criminal code should clearly differentiate between unlawful conduct and innocent, acceptable behavior without unnecessarily broadly sweeping the latter into the former,” the court opinion stated, The Republic reported. Two judges authored a dissenting opinion. “Parents and other caregivers who have changed an infant’s soiled diaper or bathed a toddler will be surprised to learn that they have committed a class 2 or 3 felony,” the dissenting judges argued. Richelsoph described scenarios in which the legislation could be abused. “Physicians get accused of molesting children. Parents, especially in divorce situations, get accused of molesting children,” Richelsoph added. “And then you have someone spending a lot of money on a private defense attorney or having to get a public defender.” Sources: The Arizona Republic, KPNX / Photo credit: The Arizona Republic",0,0,1
282,"Washington (CNN)Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters. The highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office. Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi swiped at Donald Trump's ""disastrous maternity leave and childcare plan"" ahead of the meeting. ""Just like his tax plan, Donald Trump's maternity leave and childcare plan is designed to benefit the wealthy, while leaving hard-working women and families behind,"" Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""Unsurprisingly, LGBT families, fathers and adoptive parents have no place in Trump's pinched notion of hard-working America.""

814,"What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL. The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot. Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people. Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.   His comments about Kaepernick were as follows… “When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’ Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans. If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest. And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed. Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything. How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed. Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not. I can tell you what they can do to better themselves. I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life. If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action. Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path. Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help! Screw Kaepernick. ",0,0,1
389,"(CNN)A trail of clues provided by a Washington Post reporter and his readers led Univision anchor Enrique Acevedo to Donald Trump's shimmering golf resort outside Miami earlier this week. There, Acevedo found something that has elicited both shock and mystery within the political world: a portrait of Trump that the Republican nominee reportedly paid for using money from his charitable foundation. ""A lot of people have been looking for this painting,"" Acevedo wrote Wednesday. The search was prompted by David Fahrenthold, the Washington Post reporter who has been investigating the Trump Foundation. In a story published Tuesday, Fahrenthold reported that the real estate mogul had used money from the Trump Foundation to purchase a $10,000, four-foot-tall acrylic painting of himself at a charity fundraiser. Fahrenthold had already reported that Trump used the foundation's money to buy another portrait of himself, one that was six-feet-tall and cost $20,000. Experts say each purchase was possibly illegal. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Following the report Tuesday, an eagle-eyed Twitter follower notified Fahrenthold that a photo on TripAdvisor showed the portrait hanging at the Trump National Doral Resort near Miami. The resort happens to be mere blocks from Univision's studios. Acevedo, who said he's been following Fahrenthold's reporting for weeks, reserved a room late Tuesday night at the hotel using points from his personal credit card. ""I didn't want to give Univision's money to one of Trump's businesses,"" he said. Acevedo eventually located the painting at the entrance of the Champions Bar & Grill insider the resort, marking the latest triumph in Fahrenthold's intrepid and collaborative reporting. ""I consider it a very small contribution to David's phenomenal reporting,"" Acevedo told CNN in an email. Fahrenthold, for his part, disagrees. ""Enrique deserves 99.9 percent of the credit for that find, since it was he who figured out how to get on the property (by booking a room), and then how to find the photo itself,"" he told CNN in an email. Fahrenthold's reporting was cited in a speech last week by President Barack Obama, who compared the Clinton family foundation with Trump's foundation. ""One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world,"" Obama said. ""The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself."" When he learned of the President's comment, Fahrenthold put in another request to his readers. ""Reminder,"" he tweeted, ""I am still looking for this portrait."" The next day, he had a lead from a Washington Post reader who had shipped the painting to another one of Trump's golf clubs in Briarcliff Manor, New York. ""This all happened because of social media,"" Fahrenthold told CNN in the email, saying he hoped the TripAdvisor photo would motivate a Florida reporter to track it down. ""Enrique did just that -- although, it turns out, I had underestimated how much work this would actually take,"" he said. ",1,0,0
820,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist. Oh how wrong they were, and still are. First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins. The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in. Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:  The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers. So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist. Ok, yeah, that sounds logical. Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.” Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November. (Source: Breitbart) ",0,0,1

139,"Trump currently has his hands full with the ongoing lawsuit against his company âTrump Universityâ. Â Now, a federal judge, the same one Trump insulted during a recent rally, has ordered that Trump University documents be released. Trumpâs attorneys tried to avoid this outcome by claiming that the documents they were requesting included important trade secrets. Â But that didnât stop Judge Gonzalo Curiel. The result of this decision could certainly be damaging for the Trump campaign. Â While Trump can brush many things off his back for some unknown reason, the idea of a fraud university that tricked college-aged students and put them into debt is rather disturbing. Furthermore, Judge Curiel stated that part of the reason he wanted the documents released is the public interest in Trumpâs case. Itâs clear that Trump has felt threatened by this whole ordeal. Â For 12 whole minutes of a 58 minute speech, Trump insulted this judge and claimed he wasnât playing fair. Â Citing the fact that this judge was appointed by President Obama, and that he has made rulings against Trump, Trump claims he is biased. He also indirectly insinuated that the judge is biased because he is âMexicanâ (which actually isnât true at all, even if that mattered â heâs from the US). Trump University was started in 2004 as a firm to offer courses and workshops in entrepreneurship. Â The University used the Trump brand and marketed it as an opportunity to be a apprentice of Trump himself. Â Trump became a 93% owner of the enterprise and has benefitted from its profits. The problem is that many students believe they have not benefitted from the instruction. Â The university is not accredited, you canât earn a degree, and yet thousands of students took out tens of thousands of dollars worth of loans to attend. Â Several lawsuits were placed against the âuniversityâ by its students. The state of New York even placed their complaints against Trump University. Â The state filed a $40 million lawsuit saying the school gave âfalse promisesâ. Â The New York State Board of Education claimed it was âmisleading and even illegalâ to call the firm a university. As a result, the name changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. Â Around 80,000 people have been documented as attending free introductory seminars, while 9000 paid $1,500 for three-day seminars. Â All of that doesnât sound too bad, but take into account that 800 people paid around $35,000 for larger packages such as mentorship programs. In the lawsuit by the state of New York, under New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, it was alleged that Trump defrauded over 5,000 individuals. In a script only Trump could use, he claimed in marketing videos for the school that: âWe are going to have professors and adjust professors that are absolutely terrificâ¦and these are all people who are going to be handpicked by me.â Michael Sexton, one of the top executives of the institution, said himself that ânone of the professors at the live eventsâ were actually picked by Trump. The story and lawsuit of Trump University may just be one of the most symbolic things about the Trump candidacy and the man himself. Â He uses his name recognition and the perception of wealth and success to further his interests. Â Itâs essentially âIâm rich because Iâm rich, now give me more money/power because Iâm richâ. By tagging his name along with the name of an unaccredited educational institution, thousands of people were duped into believing it would be worth their money. If Trump University had been named the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative all along, perhaps the allegations would seem more hollow. Â After all, people pay for overpriced seminars and workshops all the time. However, naming the institution âTrump Universityâ gives it the illusion that it is the kind of place a student could come to get a degree in lieu of another college. Â That is just simply not the case. In the end, this lawsuit could end in Trump losing tens of millions of dollars, along with tens of millions of votes. Â Thatâs a huge chunk of his fortune given that, depending on who listen to, some analysts estimate he is only worth between 20-70 million in terms of cash, assets and bonds. He himself claims he is worth several billion, but the truth is probably somewhere in-between.",0,1,0
1397,"President Obama routinely paints a rosy picture regarding the war on terror. He assures us that ISIS is decimated and that we have little to fear from the looming presence of radical Islam throughout the world.   He’s wrong. Not only are we engaged culturally in a very serious war with radical Islam, at best, our military efforts can only be described as hindrances to the advancement of the murderous elements of Islam. However, as weak as our response to ISIS has been, it is satisfying to see that our airstrikes are making life more difficult for the terrorist factions that require money to wage war. According to an Iraqi source, ISIS has begun harvesting the organs of their dead and dying in order to traffic the organs for cash as our airstrikes decimate their oil fields and rob them of the riches therein. “Special medical unit of the organization proceeded to steal human organs for about 23 ISIS militants of those who slept in the hospitals of Nineveh,” the Iraqi source said. “What has been stolen from those members included the kidneys, intestines and more; they were transferred under tight control to affiliated hospital on the outskirts of the city.” The source who wished to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, said that the move comes as a reaction to the decimation of oil fields. “This came after the loss of the majority of sources of financial funding, particularly with regard to crude oil, which it provides about 80% of the imports of the terrorist organization.” It is gratifying to see that ISIS must tighten their belts. However, what the world needs is a complete and thorough domination and destruction of radical Islam and so long as the Western world confuses idiocy with tolerance, it’s unlikely that we will see the leadership necessary to fix this problem.

193,"President Obama is now in the record books. He just reached a record-settingÂ 78 months of job growth. Since 2010, businesses have added more than 15.1 million jobs. Thatâs longer than any president ever has before. This news comes after the August jobs report was just released, showing an additional 151,000 added in that month alone. Jason Furman, the Chairman of the Council Economic Advisers, added: this is while âthe unemployment rate and labor force participation rate have both held steady.â Â   He further stated: âSo far in 2016, job growth has averaged a solid 182,000 jobs a month, well above the pace of about 80,000 jobs a month needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate, and hourly earnings for private-sector workers have increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, much faster than the pace of inflation.â We must remind you, this isnât partisan analysis. This is undisputed data. In the past, the GOP used to complain about the low unemployment (this was their primary talking point) but since Obama took office, and with those numbers showing only positive growth, they have instead switched their argument to the economyâs participation rate. Except â thereâs only one problem with that. The participation rate is largely in decline due to the baby boom generation retiring. In fact, itâs been in decline for quite some time, spanning back even before George W. Bushâs presidency. The truth is, the economy hasnât been this good in some time. Itâs nearly 15 percent bigger, actually, than it was in 2008. Â Itâs time to start giving President Obama credit where credit is due. Republicans may not like it, but the fact remains, Obama just made history. Featured Image Getty Images.",0,1,0
1015,"Making his case against nationalistic and anti-immigration movements that have grown both in the U.S. and around the globe, President Barack Obama told the United Nations general assembly Tuesday that “today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.” Obama’s remark appeared to be an allusion to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has campaigned hard against the president’s record and has pledged to build a wall along America’s southern border with Mexico. In his final address as president before the United Nations general assembly, Obama was critical of the isolationist movement that Trump has championed in the U.S. and others have pushed abroad. Story Continued Below “As these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward, both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest,” Obama said after discussing economic inequality and other international issues. “Religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism, sometimes from the far left but more often from the far right, which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination. We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. ” “Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,” the president continued. “So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared.” The president led his speech with a celebration of global accomplishments to which the U.S. has been party during his administration, listing the reduction of terrorists’ safe havens, the landmark nuclear agreement with Iran and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba as successes. But Obama also listed global problems like the flow of refugees, continued financial disruptions, and a lack of basic order and security in the Middle East. The president urged the international community “that we must go forwards and not backwards,” offering a defense of Western values as the best path forward for global growth and success. “I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century,” Obama said. “I make this argument not based on theory or ideology but on facts.” In making that case, Obama warned against strongman governments and oppressive tactics like media suppression. He said such strategies are stifling for economies hungry for information and ultimately lead to further crackdowns or the scapegoating of foreign enemies that can lead to war. Speaking specifically of the Middle East, Obama called for the recognition of a “common humanity” that would serve as a stepping stone toward resolving the various conflicts in the region. Again attacking isolationism, Obama said the rest of the world cannot turn its back on conflict in the Middle East in the hope that violence will be contained to the region. “Until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer, most of all in that region, but extremism will continue to be exported overseas,” he said. “And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.”",1,0,0
1610,"The Ku Klux Klan — the most notorious white supremacist group in the country — is now advertising its presence with flyers and cryptic messaging. In the 15 months since white supremacist Dylann Roof’s mass shooting at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, flyers promoting the Klan (KKK) have appeared in communities across the country. The Washington Post reported that flyers were seen in California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other states. The flyers are often left on lawns inside plastic bags weighed down with rocks, along with various racist, Islamophobic, and anti-immigrant messages. One resident in Fishers, Indiana received a bag that included a KKK flyer along with a crudely written note bashing immigrants, minorities, and homosexuals. Ross Olsby told the Indianapolis Star he picked up approximately 200 bags on neighbors’ lawns so their children wouldn’t have to see them. “You think we made a lot of progress in the last 80 years, and I guess we have, but boy it’s 2016 and we still have work to do I guess,” Olsby said. Photo by Kaitlin Lange, Indianapolis Star The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors and profiles hate groups across the US, said in their most recent “Year in Hate and Extremism” report that KKK groups have nearly tripled in size, suggesting racists have become more emboldened. In 2014, there were roughly 72 KKK affiliate groups in the US. By 2015, there were almost 200 KKK groups. 35-year-old Jaimi Hajzus, of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, said the ominous flyers started appearing in her neighborhood this past weekend. She told the Post that she’s worried Klan groups are trying to incite a race war with the incendiary flyers. “If this is actually a resurgence of a hateful and violent group, then we need to take a stance,” Hajzus said. KKK flyer, courtesy of Jaimi Hajzus for the Washington Post US Uncut’s attempts to call the “24-Hour Klanline” listed on the flyers were unsuccessful, and the mailbox associated with the number was full as of 12 PM Eastern on Wednesday afternoon.          ",0,1,0

By Zia Weise 9/26/16, 5:33 AM CET Updated 9/27/16, 7:24 AM CET Children sit in a classroom in the refugee camp of Lagadikia | Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP via Getty Images LESBOS, Greece — Ten-year-old Foual from Gaza is an aspiring polyglot. At the entrance to Kara Tepe, the second-largest refugee camp on Lesbos, he greets visitors in English, German, and Spanish. He knows some Turkish, too, and can almost count to twenty in Greek. “I’m learning by myself,” Foual says proudly. He has no alternative: there are no formal schools in Greek camps. As a refugee in Lebanon, he attended three years of primary education, but since he arrived in Europe six months ago, he’s been out of school. Ask parents why they decided to make the journey across the Mediterranean, and most will tell you that they took the risk to ensure a better future for their children. But since the Balkan states closed their borders in March, the thousands of refugee children marooned in Greece have had little or no access to education, despite having reached Europe. They join an estimated 3.5 million refugee children across the globe who are missing out on school. Starting this month, the Greek government is hoping to change that by enrolling refugees in public schools — but for the past seven months, children in camps have only had access to casual volunteer-run classes. The [Greek] ministry of education hopes to enrol thousands of refugee children in Greek schools, starting by the end of the month. Of the 27,000 children stranded in Greece, at least 18,000 are thought to be of school age. “It’s not really a school, just a class,” Foual says of the education project in Kara Tepe. His elder sister, 11-year-old Melek, interrupts: “It’s not like in Lebanon where we had a system and a curriculum. Here, it’s a little Greek, a little English, just one class for an hour a day.” Rights organisations have long warned of a “lost generation” of refugee children missing out on education. The crisis is particularly dire among Syrians: 1.5 million children who have fled to neighbouring Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon are not in school, creating a surge in child labour and early marriage. In Greece, the average refugee child has been out of school for a year and a half, according to the NGO Save the Children. Initially, education was not a priority for the Greek government, which has struggled to provide even basic services to the 60,000 asylum-seekers now marooned in the country. Yet with registration and relocation programmes moving at a snail’s pace, there is a growing realisation that the tens of thousands of asylum-seekers will remain in Greece for some time. “Things change every week, but we assume they are going to be stuck for a while,” says Naoko Imoto, an education specialist for UNICEF in Greece. “We’re thinking about years, really.” Accordingly, the Greek government has begun planning for the long term. The ministry of education hopes to enrol thousands of refugee children in Greek schools, starting by the end of the month. Of the 27,000 children stranded in Greece, at least 18,000 are thought to be of school age. For the current school year, refugee children will be taught separately from Greek students. These so-called “reception classes” will take place in the afternoon, four hours a day, focusing on Greek and English, mathematics and IT. The aim, the government says, is to prepare the refugee students to join normal classes in the coming year — either in Greece or elsewhere in Europe. For younger children, kindergartens are planned to be opened in camps. Even though asylum seekers will initially be taught separately from Greek children, the move has been met with opposition. On Tuesday, a parents’ association in the northern Greek town of Filippiada complained about the plan, voicing fears about diseases and arguing that their children would be unable to “coexist with migrant children”. Refugee children, the parents’ association states, had “different perceptions on the role of family, the place of women and religion to Greek children whose parents have made sacrifices to offer their children the best education.” The Greek education ministry earlier this month dismissed a complaint from a parents’ association in Oresteiada, another town on the northern mainland, which had threatened a sit-in protest if children from camps were admitted into their school. Also On Politico Timor Sharan Also On Politico Lili Bayer Also On Politico Florian Eder and Janosch Delcker Nikos Filis, the education minister, says the integration of refugee children would be “gradual,” and that pupils would be vaccinated before attending public schools. “Hence, there is no serious justification” for the parents’ protests but “only prejudice,” Filis says. Until the official programme comes into effect, however, volunteers and refugee teachers continue to plug the gap. Makeshift schools have popped up in most camps, but attendance is voluntary, and teaching refugee children come with challenges. “Some of them never went to school,” says Corien Tiemersma, a Dutch volunteer who has taught English in the Malakasa camp north of Athens, home to nearly a thousand mostly Afghan refugees. “And at the beginning, they weren’t used to sitting down.” UNICEF’s Imoto hopes that formal education will introduce stability to the lives of children living in limbo in Greece. “It’s urgent that we get these children into school, so that they have an education but also a sense of normalcy and hope,” she says. Imoto said they were also planning to train refugees who were teachers in their home countries to give classes in the children’s mother tongues, something Greek schools cannot provide. “They are the biggest resource we have,” she says. Education for her children was her prime motivation for making the perilous crossing to Greece, [Amal Ismail] explains, pouring the tea into glass jars that serve as cups. In Nea Kavala, a military-run tent camp north of Thessaloniki, refugees and volunteers work side-by-side in the camp’s community centre. Mahmoud Mohammad, a former tailor from Syria’s Kurdish-majority Afrin area, is using his English skills to teach children in the camp. The school, he says, “is the most important achievement in the camp.” He works alongside five others, including Ragda, a Syrian teacher from Idlib, who has been giving Arabic classes for four months. “I began volunteering because there are a lot of kids here and they should go to school,” Ragda says. There have been some difficulties, she admits. “There are some Yazidi and Kurdish children who don’t speak Arabic, so I had to teach them Arabic first.” But with limited resources and few trained teachers, the Nea Kavala school is unable to provide formal education. Classes run for only two hours a day. “I want to study. I dropped out at eighth grade in Syria,” says Rewan, a 15-year-old refugee from Afrin who has been in Nea Kavala for six months. “But there’s no real school. It’s an hour a day plus language classes, and the first level includes everyone from first to eighth grade.” A few tent rows away, Amal Ismail, a Kurdish woman from Aleppo, boils water for tea in a rusty tin. Her children, three girls and a boy, have missed out on years of school; her 11-year-old son worked with her husband in a clothing factory in Turkey’s Izmir for two years to support the family. Education for her children was her prime motivation for making the perilous crossing to Greece, she explains, pouring the tea into glass jars that serve as cups. They had been in Nea Kavala for seven months. “We lived in fear in Syria,” she says. “We thought we’d be free of fear in Europe. But here, we’re afraid our children will never go to school and learn.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

442,"Washington (CNN)A federal judge on Friday ordered the State Department to release some, but not all, of the emails recovered from Hillary Clinton's private server by the FBI ahead of the presidential election in November. DC District Court Judge James Boasberg said the department must process 1,050 pages of emails between now and November 4, releasing any non-exempt documents aside from those that are determined to be duplicates of those already released. It is unclear exactly how many pages the State Department will have to release as part of that order, but it is expected to be significantly fewer than 1,000 pages. That's because a ""substantial number"" of the recovered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates, a Justice Department attorney representing the State Department said in court. The State Department has appraised approximately 15,000 documents recovered by the FBI, believed to have been sent by or to former Secretary Clinton while she was in office. Of those, over 9,400 have been deemed personal and therefore not subject to release, the attorney said, while approximately 5,600 are believed to be work-related. Production will begin October 7, with subsequent releases October 21 and November 4 -- four days before the election. The State Department will then process 500 pages of the remaining documents per month until all have been released. The order by Judge Boasberg comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch. An attorney for Judicial Watch pressed the judge to order the release of all the relevant records prior to the election. Saying he was sympathetic to the efforts of the State Department's heavily-taxed FOIA division, Boasberg offered his 1,500-page order. ""I think it's important the public have as much clarity as possible,"" Boasberg said, but later quipped, ""sometimes I wonder if there's anything other that FOIA processing going on at State."" The Judicial Watch case is one over over two dozen FOIA lawsuits related to Clinton's emails. In a statement to CNN, State Department Spokesman John Kirby reiterated the State Department's commitment to release the official emails, and said, ""All releasable records and portions of these records will be posted on State's FOIA website.""

1442,"It looks like FBI Director James Comey is sitting in a pot of hot water and the temperature is steadily being increased. He let Hillary Clinton skate completely on the email scandal. He even said she was lying and was guilty, but let her off anyway. No one can figure out why either. Comey released highly redacted notes of his interview with Hillary Clinton. They were practically useless. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is just as complicit for meeting with Bill Clinton just before Hillary testified to the FBI. Obviously, briefing him on what Hillary should and should not say. Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.  From the Independent Journal Review: The FBI Director’s recommendation to the Attorney General not to indict Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for legal infractions with her private email server while at the State Department still has many political observers shaking their heads over the obvious legal double standard. The decision-making of FBI Director Comey, who recently sent highly redacted notes of his interview process and investigation of Hillary Clinton, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who had a private meeting with Bill Clinton prior to her case being dismissed, have been highly scrutinized. After grilling Comey on the Hill, Congress requested that the director deliver certain documents so lawmakers could better understand the scope and breadth of Hillary Clinton’s extra-legal email activities. The director has reportedly failed to deliver, and now Congress is once again trying to get transparency. The Washington Examiner reported: House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, subpoenaed FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server Hillary Clinton used when she led the State Department. Smith asked Comey for the documents in a Sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after Comey failed to comply with the request. “The committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former Secretary Clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by FISMA,” the statement from the committee read. But I doubt they will ever get the answers they are seeking… they will get stonewalled by the Obama Administration, the FBI and the Clintons, just as they always do. We seem to no longer have three functioning separate branches of government in this nation. The Executive Branch seems to rule over all now, making the Judicial Branch submissive to it and the Legislative Branch all but irrelevant. There is no better example of that than the corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton.  ",0,0,1
1509,"This is a true story.  General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief. At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over. When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.  Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve.  He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance. Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again. Good job General McChrystal.  I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line.  You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.",0,0,1
33,"Several protesters and a dozen police officers were injured, and about five people were arrested after violent protests erupted after a deadly police shooting in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday.    Officers in riot gear deployed tear gas into a crowd of protesters after individuals targeted police cruisers, ABC affiliate WSOC-TV Charlotte reported. Early this morning the unrest raged on as a group of people blocked traffic on Interstate 85. A live video feed from a WSOC-TV helicopter above the scene appeared to show people removing items from the backs of trucks on the highway.   The scene on I-85 appeared to devolve into looting, with people pulling items from tractor-trailers and burning boxes. A group of people attempted to break into a Walmart, WSOC-TV reported, and scattered when police arrived at the scene. At least seven civilians were transported to a local hospital, and a handful were treated.    The shooting took place Tuesday afternoon after officers arrived at an apartment complex in Charlotte at about 4 p.m., searching for a suspect who had an outstanding warrant, a police statement said.    Police said the man fatally shot, identified as Keith Lamont Scott, was not the suspect officers sought but had exited from a vehicle with a firearm and the officers believed he posed an imminent deadly threat. Scott's family quickly challenged the police account of the shooting, saying that he was not armed and that he was holding a book and waiting for his son to be dropped off from school, WSOC-TV reports.    Detectives say they recovered at the scene the firearm they believe Scott was holding at the time of the shooting, WSOC-TV reported. Charlotte's Mayor Jennifer Roberts tweeted that ""the community deserves answers and full investigation will ensue"" and asked for calm as investigators work the case.    Police identified the officer involved in the shooting Brentley Vinson, who has been employed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department since July 21, 2014, and is assigned to the metro division.

1582,"Hillary Clinton, former, Secretary of State, has stuck to her story that she handed over all of her work-related emails. Even though, she wiped her computer with the equivalent of electronic bleach, not a simple cloth, yeah…she has absolutely nothing to hide! The best part, Hillary holds fast to her claim, even as new batches of emails are recovered. Emails, that were not included in her alleged “complete” batch, she’d originally turned over. Now, 30 emails that had been previously wiped off the face of the earth, were recovered. Unfortunately for Hillary, they were related to Benghazi, but she knew that didn’t she?  FBI investigators recovered 30 emails from Hillary Clintonâs wiped server which discussed Benghazi, government lawyers said in federal court on Tuesday. The disclosure was made during a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta in a case involving a lawsuit filed by the watchdog group Judicial Watch. Government lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton to State. The agency said it would need until the end of September to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released. Government lawyers revealed in a court filing last week that some of the emails recovered by FBI investigators from her email server contained âsearch termsâ related to Benghazi. Clinton gave the State Department more than 30,000 of her work-related emails in Dec. 2014. Of those, the State Department released 296 emails related to Benghazi and Libya. The agency asserted that those were all of the Clinton emails it had pertaining to Benghazi. But in September, the State Department discovered another 925 Benghazi-related emails. Those were handed over to the House Select Committee on Benghazi. But it was revealed last month that Clinton deleted âseveral thousandâ work-related emails from her server. Do they really need a full day to prepare per email that was recovered? Must be some pretty good stuff in there… Hmmm",0,0,1
962,"NEW YORK — An Afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked a New York City neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town was captured Monday after being wounded in a shootout with police that erupted when he was discovered asleep in the doorway of a New Jersey bar, authorities said. WABC-TV footage showed a man believed to be 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher in Linden, New Jersey. He appeared to be conscious and looking around. Story Continued Below Two officers were wounded in the gun battle but were not believed to have been seriously hurt, authorities said. Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said that the owner of a bar reported someone asleep in the doorway of his business. A police officer went to investigate and recognized the man as Rahami, police and the mayor said. Rahami pulled a gun and shot the officer — who was wearing a bulletproof vest — in the torso, and more officers joined in a running gun battle down the street and brought Rahami down, police Capt. James Sarnicki said. The arrest came just hours after police issued a bulletin and photo of Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan with an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Authorities said the blasts were looking increasingly like an act of terrorism with a foreign connection. Police did not disclose how they zeroed in on Rahami as a person of interest in the bombing investigation but were known to be poring over surveillance video. At the same time, five people who were pulled over in a vehicle Sunday night were being questioned by the FBI, officials said. The shootout came after a weekend of fear and dread in New York and New Jersey. In addition to the blast that injured 29 people in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, an unexploded pressure cooker bomb was found blocks away, and a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town before a charity race. No one was injured there. On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Also on Saturday, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Authorities have not drawn any connection between the violence in Minnesota and the bombings in the New York area. Citing the FBI, New Jersey State Police said Monday that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information, they learned there were ""certain commonalities among the bombs,"" leading authorities to believe ""that there was a common group behind the bombs."" Before Rahami's capture, Cuomo said investigators have no reason to believe there are further threats, but the public should ""be on constant guard."" Around the time Rahami was taken into custody, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, and said it was ""extremely fortunate"" nobody was killed in the bombings. He called on Americans to show the world ""we will never give in to fear."" ""We all have a role to play as citizens to make sure we don't succumb to that fear. And there's no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey,"" the president said. ""Folks around here, they don't get scared."" Rahami lived with his family in Elizabeth in an apartment above a fried-chicken restaurant owned by his father, on a busy street a few miles from the Newark airport. Early Monday, FBI agents swarmed the apartment. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said Rahami's father, Mohammad Rahami, and two brothers sued the city after it passed an ordinance requiring the First American Fried Chicken restaurant to close early because of complaints from neighbors that it was a late-night nuisance. Ryan McCann, of Elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing the younger Rahami working there more. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home,"" McCann said. In the immediate aftermath of the New York bombing, de New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appeared to be changing. ""The more we learn with each passing hour is it looks more like terrorism,"" de Blasio said in an interview on NY1 News. Cuomo said on MSNBC: ""Today's information suggests it may be foreign-related, but we'll see where it goes."" On Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped ""a vehicle of interest"" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser. She wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the investigation. On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. Cellphones were discovered at the site of both the New York and New Jersey bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The pipe bomb that exploded Saturday in Seaside Park went off before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled. One of the five devices found at the Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot tried to disarm it. No one was hurt.",1,0,0

1311,"Lester Holt was on an island on Monday night. And for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shoot their missiles at one another. It made for some memorable exchanges between Trump and Clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. For some debate watchers, that’s what they want their moderators to do: say ""go"" and let them run. But it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions. Story Continued Below There was no probing of Trump’s wall with Mexico, and vow to get the Mexicans to pay for it, or the Republican nominee’s ban on Muslims entering the country. And he barely prodded Clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences. The Clinton Foundation? Wasn’t discussed; neither was the Benghazi attack. Few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as Holt did, with Clinton’s allies demanding he serve as a fact-checker and Trump’s backers insisting that he allow the candidates to have their say. Before the network broadcasts began, Holt seemed to reveal his choice, telling the audience he wanted to “facilitate” the conversation between “just the two of them.” Holt is often seen as understated. His arrival on the national stage was under the radar, as he quietly assumed the NBC anchor chair while Brian Williams’ career was careening to a halt, removed as anchor of “Nightly News” over allegations he exaggerated his experience covering the Iraq war. But during the debate, that understated approach sometimes led to the candidates, especially Trump, rolling over his questions, with Holt at one point admitting that they were far behind schedule. It started early, during the first segment about the economy. Holt asked Trump how he specifically will help put money back in the pocket of Americans. Trump offered few specifics, veering into criticism of Clinton’s decades of public service without improving trade agreements. Holt tried to interrupt but Trump kept rolling. He managed, a few seconds later, to follow up, pressing for specifics. But the end of the first segment would lead some critics on Twitter to ask “Where’s Lester?"" ""Apparently Lester Holt went to the bathroom, way down the hall, and only one urinal is available and there is a line,” joked National Review writer Jim Geraghty in a tweet. As Clinton and Trump sparred over debate and taxes, jabbing one another over and over again, Holt kept trying to jump in. ""Let me get you to pause right there,” he said as Trump was claiming Clinton was going to “approve one of the biggest tax increases."" ""Lester, that can't be left to stand,” Clinton shot back, one of several times she asked Holt to “turn back the clock” or step in as Trump steamrolled through questions. When Trump continuously interrupted Clinton during her answers, Holt would at most offer a pleading,""This is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please."" But Holt’s understatement didn’t mean he was completely walked over. At different points, Holt pushed back against both candidates. ""Last week you said we have to do everything possible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe police are implicitly biassed against black people?” Holt asked Clinton. And as the debate went on, he became more engaged and pushed back harder against Trump, on his birtherism, Iraq War support and his taxes. When Trump tried to assert again, falsely, that he was always against the Iraq war, Holt was sure to not step into the same problems his colleague Matt Lauer, who let Trump’s claim he didn’t support the Iraq war slide. Initially, Holt did not interrupt when Trump barked “Wrong” as Clinton said he supported the war. But a few moments later, he came back. “The record shows otherwise,” Holt said, later referring to Trump’s 2002 interview with Howard Stern, which Trump himself then later said that in the interview with Stern said he said ""who knows."" The reaction from the media and pundits was mixed, though mostly positive. “[Holt] provided some realtime fact checking but let Trump go off on tangents and repeat too many proven lies,” said Washingotn Post Media columnist Margaret Sullivan, giving holt a “B-minus” grade. ""[Holt] didn't make himself the story, and was dignified, if medium-weak and sometimes absent."" Former CNN Washington Bureau Chief Frank Sesno offered: ""I think Holt has done an excellent job. Has been firm and fair, called Trump on statements more than Hillary but spent most of his efforts steering the conversation / debate to the two candidates.” Not everyone was not as happy with how Holt treated Trump. ""Has the moderator challenged Clinton on anything?” tweeted the tax-cut activist Grover Norquist. “Lester Holt interrupted Mr. Trump more, he followed up with Mr. Trump more, he was much hard on Mr. Trump,” complained Trump senior advisor Boris Epshteyn. ""Lester Holt, to a degree, succumbed to the pressure form the left wing media and the Democrats after Matt Lauer moderated the forum."" Hugh Hewitt, the conservative talk show host, didn’t seem to agree. ""Conservatives should agree @LesterHoltNBC did a very fine job moderating. He pushed on birther issue and Iraq war but gave plenty of time,” he tweeted. Trump himself seemed perfectly happy with Holt’s performance. ""I thought Lester Holt did a great job. ... I thought the questions were very fair,” Trump told reporters in the spin room after the debate.",1,0,0
441,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump is watching videos of Hillary Clinton's past debate performances -- including both her highlights and lowlights -- ahead of their first debate Monday. A source familiar with his preparations described Trump's preparation, which has been described as far more minimal than Clinton's, who is currently off the campaign trail to practice before the highly anticipated, nationally broadcast event. Trump has huddled with his closest advisers in his prep session, including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who sat in on last weekend's meeting, the source said. Priebus will join Trump again this weekend. Clinton is similarly watching tape of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him, particularly in his exchanges with rival Ted Cruz, and studied his style. To knock Trump off his game, people advising Clinton have been looking for a one-line retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest. But Democrats worry the first debate will give Trump a chance to show a more moderate, controlled side, while millions of people watch, possibly for the first time. This, according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state, is not lost on Clinton. Earlier this week, a top Trump aide mocked Clinton's extensive preparations for Monday's debate in an internal campaign memo. ""These are hallmarks of a career politician who has spent too much time seeking and clinging to power,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in the memo. ""He's not rehearsing canned 30-second soundbites or spending hours in the film room like an NFL player. He will be prepared, but most importantly, he will be himself,"" Miller added. In contrast to those lowered expectations set by Trump's staff, the GOP nominee may have raised the bar for himself by poking fun at Clinton's debate preparations at a rally in Pennsylvania Thursday night, suggesting she is still recovering from her recent bout with pneumonia. ""Well they say she's been practicing for the debate. Some people think she's sleeping,"" Trump quipped at the event. CNN's Dan Merica and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",1,0,0
928,"Bloomberg News reports that the Mexican peso grew significantly stronger after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s powerful performance in tonight’s key first presidential debate, after confidently besting Republican Donald Trump. The “invisible hand” of the market is predicting a Hillary Clinton win after tonight’s debate, and that she’s the only one of the two candidates whose election would keep more jobs in the USA too: The Mexican peso rebounded from a record low, a sign investors may perceive Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in the first U.S. presidential debate. The currency rose 2 percent to 19.4879 per dollar as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest gain across more than 140 currencies worldwide, after the debate concluded. Around the world, currency traders, the kind-of-by-the-numbers, bottom line capitalists who Republicans profess to believe in the most, were unequivocal. They awarded victory in the first 2016 Presidential debate to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by buying up Mexican pesos believing them to be more valuable with a stable diplomatic situation, and by the numbers traders weighed in: “I shall not speculate on whether Clinton won or was Trumped,” wrote Jeffrey Halley wrote market strategist at Oanda Corporation in Singapore, “But clearly, the highest [correlated] currency to a Trump victory thinks she did!” On a practical level, a stronger Peso also means that labor in Mexico will get more expensive for American companies as the exchange rate moves when Hillary does better in polling. Professional currency traders have been betting against the Mexican currency for months to insure themselves against an improbable Republican victory in November, which would set forth a catastrophe if NAFTA is unilaterally cancelled, costing millions of Americans their jobs to appease Trump’s delirious policy dreams. Ironically, this means that a Trump victory would make outsourcing far more attractive since people would depress the value of Mexican pesos, making the cost of hiring even cheaper than today. This also means that a Hillary Clinton victory in November will make Mexico’s currency stronger, which will in turn make it more attractive to our corporations to hire American workers or slow down the rate of outsourcing because of higher labor costs south of the border with a stronger Peso. Voting for Hillary Clinton is now economically certain to be better than voting for her lying Republican opponent, because his racism would literally be self-defeating, and the “invisible hand of the market” would be best held by a Democrat’s steady hand in the Oval Office come January.

795,"I…can’t…even. This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy. I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them. It’s going to blow up in his face. In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it? You be the judge of that. The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible. You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair. As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run. Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either. Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings. Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner. Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run? Punchline: The law abiding ones! I’m so funny. You’re welcome. ",0,0,1
67,"Even as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has renewed his plea for government and opposition forces to stop fighting in Syria, the country's city of Aleppo was pounded overnight and Friday morning by intense bombing. Among the victims were 12 members of the same family, including six children, who were killed by airstrikes in the village of Bashkateen in Aleppo's western countryside today, said the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which attributed the strikes to Syrian government forces. The family was internally displaced, having moved to Bashkateen from another Syrian town, activists said. In east Aleppo, at least 27 people, including two children from one family, were killed by Russian and government airstrikes, according to the observatory. Many were injured and others are missing, the observatory said. Even in this war-weary city, last night's airstrikes were frightening. “My wife and daughter didn’t sleep all night. We were petrified. The sound of the explosions is much worse than usual,” an east Aleppo resident told ABC News. Airstrikes continued Friday morning, with three out of four Syrian Civil Defense centers under fire, according to a tweet by the civil defense.  3 of the 4 @SyriaCivilDef centers in Aleppo city targeted this morning. 60 air strikes in East Aleppo pic.twitter.com/g5seYilDbY The Aleppo Media Center posted photos on Twitter that it said showed damage after attacks on Aleppo's Qaterji neighborhood.  ???? ?????? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ????? 7 ????? ? 6 ???? ????? ?????.#AleppoAMC pic.twitter.com/zzMHOVj6Tv Activists claim that the Syrian government and Russia have used napalm, phosphorous and cluster bombs in attacks on Aleppo since the Syrian military declared Monday that the cease-fire had ended. ABC News has not been able to independently verify these claims.   One out of only two water-pumping stations in Aleppo was hit overnight, according to local activists. The two stations are under the control of forces opposed to the Syrian government but provide water for both rebel-held eastern Aleppo and government-held western Aleppo. The attacks Thursday and Friday followed an announcement from the Syrian military that it was launching an offensive against eastern Aleppo and offering evacuation corridors for civilians. In the statement, the military urged civilians to stay away from “locations of armed terrorist groups.” Residents said the government's move is part of a deliberate policy of forced displacement.   Meanwhile, eastern Aleppo is still waiting for aid, which was supposed to reach the besieged area during the U.S.-Russia-brokered cease-fire. The truce was broken Monday when an attack on an aid convoy in western Aleppo left at least 21 people dead, including several aid workers. The United Nations has 40 trucks with aid ready to enter eastern Aleppo. The aid has been sitting by the Turkish border since the beginning of last week and is still waiting by the border in Syria customs area. Once the U.N. gets the green light, the first convoy carrying a month's worth of wheat flour for more than 150,000 people will be sent to Aleppo, according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The shipment will be followed up by a delivery of enough food rations to feed 35,000 people for a month. “The recent upsurge of violence in east Aleppo is obviously a concern for us. However, we are standby,” David Swanson, spokesman for the U.N.’s humanitarian affairs office, told ABC News. “As humanitarians on the front line we are ready to move. It is now up to the politicians to make this a reality.” The distance from the Turkish border to east Aleppo is only some 40 miles, but the journey could take about four to five hours. Up to 275,000 people in eastern Aleppo are in need of humanitarian aid. Aid workers have not been able to reach the besieged area since clashes between the Syrian government and armed rebel groups started July 7. Around 13.5 million people in Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance, while 4.8 million have fled their country and 6.1 million are internally displaced, according to this month's figures from the U.N.'s humanitarian affairs office.",1,0,0

Clinton also suggested that his wife’s unpopularity with voters is due in part to the negative coverage of the ongoing email scandal. “They're responding to the fact that this email thing was treated like the most important event since the end of World War II,” he said. “I wonder if there's a man in America that could have taken what she's been through in the last year and a half.”",1,0,0

And now, late last night when most of you were sleeping, a pipe bomb was found near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey -- just 20 miles outside of Manhattan. There are 50 days until Election Day. DEVELOPING -- “Pipe Bombs Found Near Train Station in Elizabeth, N.J., Official Says,” by NYT’s Nate Schweber and Jonah Engel Bromwich: “The bomb drama rattling the New York region arrived here on Sunday night when two men walked out of Hector’s Place Restaurant near the city’s train station and found a backpack containing five explosives resting atop a municipal garbage can, Mayor J. Christian Bollwage said. Story Continued Below “After finding that the backpack contained ‘wires and a pipe,’ the mayor said, the men dropped the item in the street and contacted the Elizabeth Police Department shortly about 8:45 p.m. The police, in turn, called the Union County bomb squad, and the investigation was quickly turned over to the F.B.I. and the New Jersey State Police, Mr. Bollwage said. The F.B.I. then sent in a pair of robots and determined that the backpack held five bombs, some of which were pipe bombs, the mayor said. Around 12:30 a.m., the robots attempted to clip a wire to disarm one bomb and accidentally detonated it, the mayor said. ‘As a robot was trying to disarm one of the devices it exploded,’ he said. No injuries were reported.” http://nyti.ms/2cVPtmp -- “FBI seeks confirmation that St. Cloud attacker was pledged to ISIL,” by the Star Tribune’s Stephen Montemayor: “The claim on social media Sunday had a familiar ring: The man who stabbed nine people in a St. Cloud mall on Saturday was ‘a soldier of the Islamic State.’ His attack, the message continued, was an ‘operation in response to calls to target the citizens of the crusader coalition.’ “The Amaq News Agency, media wing of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has used nearly identical language in taking credit for at least a half-dozen other attacks in Western countries in recent months, analysts say. If confirmed, the episode also marks a new chapter in ISIL’s link to Minnesota. ISIL’s claim, a little more than 12 hours after Dahir A. Adan, 22, carried out his attack, mirrors the group’s response to killings in San Bernardino late last year and a more recent spate of terrorism in Europe, according to counterterrorism analyst Thomas Joscelyn … Minnesota is home to the nation’s largest ongoing terrorism recruitment investigation, with 11 Somali-Minnesotans charged since late 2014 in an alleged plot to travel to Syria and join ISIL.” http://strib.mn/2cK10oc **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX --@realDonaldTrump: “Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad.

Law enforcement officials are working to identify who was behind the attacks in New York and New Jersey and we should give them the support they need to finish the job and bring those responsible to justice - we will not rest until that happens. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack in Minnesota, and this should steel our resolve to protect our country and defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups. “I have laid out a comprehensive plan to do that. This includes launching an intelligence surge to help identify and thwart attacks before they can be carried out, and to spot lone wolf attackers. We also need to work with Silicon Valley to counter propaganda and recruitment efforts online. Americans have faced threats before, and our resilience in the face of them only makes us stronger.

Here are some numbers you need to know about what America thinks about the debates and its moderators, courtesy of our friends at Morning Consult, who conducted a poll of 1,861 registered voters last week. -- A sky-high 73% of those polled said it was very likely or somewhat likely they would watch the first debate. 37% said they thought it was likely Hillary Clinton would win, 31% said they thought Donald Trump would win and 32% didn’t know or had no opinion. -- LESTER HOLT, the “NBC Nightly News” anchor who is moderating the first debate, is seen as favorable by 47% of those polled, and 20% view him as unfavorable. Just 39% of Republicans see him as favorable, while 60% of Democrats view him as favorable. -- ANDERSON COOPER of CNN, who will co-host the second presidential debate, is seen as favorable with 58% of those polled -- by far the most popular moderator. He is also seen as the moderator who will be the toughest and least biased. --CHRIS WALLACE of Fox News, who will moderate the last debate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, has 60% favorability ratings with Republicans.

Stephen Moore, an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained, ‘We want to identify maybe twenty-five executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office.’ “Over the summer, I interviewed several dozen people about what the United States could expect from Donald Trump’s first term. Campaign advisers shared his plans, his associates relayed conversations, and I consulted veterans of five Republican Administrations, along with economists, war gamers, historians, legal scholars, and political figures in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Most of the people I spoke with outside the campaign expected Trump to lose. But they also expected his impact to endure, and they identified examples of the ways in which he had already altered political chemistry far beyond the campaign. After seventy years of American efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, Trump has suggested that South Korea and Japan might be wise to develop them. Returning from a recent visit to Seoul, Scott Sagan, a political-science professor at Stanford who is a nuclear-arms specialist, told me, ‘These kinds of statements are having an effect. A number of political leaders, mostly from the very conservative sides of the parties, are openly calling for nuclear weapons.’” http://bit.ly/2dcPOTP PRESIDENT TRUMP – “Why a President Trump Could Start a Trade War With Surprising Ease,” by Justin Wolfers in The Upshot: “[I]nternational trade policy is one area where a President Trump could unilaterally deliver on the changes that he has promised. Mr. Trump has said that as president he would ‘rip up’ international trade deals such as [NAFTA], withdraw from the [WTO] and sharply raise the tariffs charged on goods imported from China and Mexico. As president he could pretty much do it.

It is a threshold no previous Republican has ever achieved in a single campaign.

Despite polling well in Pennsylvania throughout the summer, Clinton's team is nevertheless bearing down in a state her party has carried in six straight elections. They are ratcheting up advertising and dispatching their top supporters to Pennsylvania, from Bill Clinton to Joe Biden to last week’s visit from President Barack Obama … “At a minimum, an energized Pennsylvania campaign is a balm for Clinton as she weathers a dip in national polls and dips in the swing states of Florida and Ohio.

Audrey mentioned ‘Hamilton’ and being in the room where it happens -- well, she’s been in the room where it happens, repeatedly. And her judgment has been unerring, and she has been disciplined, and she has been extraordinarily effective in every job that she’s had. ... “This guy is not qualified to be president. And he shows no interest in even gaining the rudimentary knowledge required to make really hard decisions on a day-to-day basis. There's no curiosity, there's no desire to get up to speed. It’s an infomercial. It’s a reality show.

John Kasich’s war with the national Republican Party exploded into the open Sunday night, when his top adviser thrashed GOP leader Reince Priebus and hinted that the presidential election may be out of reach. The statement, issued on official campaign letterhead, followed remarks by Priebus earlier Sunday suggesting the party might block the Ohio governor from running for office again because he has refused to support Donald Trump. “‘Thankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics,’ said John Weaver, Kasich’s adviser, adding, ‘The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does.’ “It’s a stunning act of open hostility between the national Republican Party and the governor in perhaps the most crucial swing state — and at a sensitive moment in the election. Trump has risen in national polls and inched closer to Hillary Clinton in swing states. He’s even passed her in Ohio, perhaps his strongest chance to capture a state that Mitt Romney lost in 2012.” http://politi.co/2d4KKSO CHRIS CILLIZZA -- “Sure, Trump has the momentum.

Add in the District of Columbia, which also fits the bill, and you get 242 electoral votes. Thirteen is the number of states every Republican presidential nominee has won in those same presidential elections. Add them up, and you get 102 electoral votes ... “Consider this: If Clinton wins the 18 states plus the District that every Democrat has won since 1992 and also wins Florida (and its 29 electoral votes), she is president. If Clinton wins those 18, the nation’s capital and Ohio (18 electoral votes) and Virginia (13 electoral votes), it’s over.” http://wapo.st/2cXpEFc **** A message from BP: We’ve donated $147 million to U.S. community programs over the past five years.

55,"A group of Senate Democrats have asked the U.S. Department of Labor to open an investigation into whether Wells Fargo violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The letter follows a hearing on Capitol Hill this week that saw bank CEO John Stumpf face blistering questions from senators over a scandal involving allegations from regulators that employees opened accounts without customers' knowledge or permission. Separately, Stumpf resigned from his position on the Federal Advisory Council effective today, the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank told ABC News. The council generally meets with the Federal Reserve four times a year to advise it on banking and economic issues.     The FLSA establishes standards for wage, overtime, youth employment and record-keeping for both the private and public sector, according to the DOL's website. Among other stipulations, the FLSA mandates that non-exempt employees receive overtime pay equal to 1.5 times his or her regular rate, if the employee works more than 40 hours per week. Describing Wells Fargo's opening or attempted opening of the accounts as ""fraud,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Labor Secretary Tom Perez and DOL Administrator David Weil that ""the suggestion last week by Chief Executive John Stumpf that '[t]here was no incentive to do bad things' at Wells Fargo -- a company that fired 5,300 employees over five years due to improper selling but made little effort to change its policies -- does not appear to be grounded in reality."" The reason for that, the senators claimed, citing media reports, is that ""dozens of former and current Wells Fargo employees have come forward to describe the lengths they went to in order to meet the bank's aggressive sales quotas,"" and, ""When quotas weren't met, employees faced threats of termination; mandated hours of unpaid overtime; harassment; and other forms of retaliation."" DOL spokesman Jason Surbey acknowledged that the agency had received the letter, and said: ""While we cannot discuss details of potential law enforcement decision-making, we do take the concerns raised in the letter very seriously."" On Sept. 13, the bank said that it would end its sales goals program effective Jan. 1, 2017. In response to the senators' request to the DOL, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer G. Dunn told ABC News today that ""our team members are our greatest asset."" ""We strive to make every one of them feel valued, rewarded and recognized and we pride ourselves on creating a positive environment for our team members, including market competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits, and a strong offering of work-life programs,"" Dunn added. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Jack Reed, D-R.I., Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, sent the letter two days after many of them grilled Stumpf for nearly three hours in a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Capitol Hill.",1,0,0
728,"When reading an article like this, think of manmade global warming… From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Government funding of scientific research has a corrupting influence that could cause more unethical behavior among researchers, according to a new study by scientists at Virginia Tech. Researchers found federal funding is encouraging scientists to falsify data and publish bad research. The study found that universities are making the problem worse by mostly hiring young scientists as adjuncts, not tenure-track positions, which increases the financial pressures causing them to distort science. “Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself,” Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy, researchers at Virginia Tech, wrote in their study. Edwards was the scientist who helped expose that the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) top Midwest official knew about the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis months before telling the public. “Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior,” they wrote. Government funding of research produces enormous financial incentives for scientists to engage in dubious laboratory research. Academics are under serious financial pressure to rapidly and continually publish research to sustain or further their careers, even if the research is essentially useless or misleading. Even major scientific journals like Nature are asking “Is Science Broken?” “The first problem are that the government provides monopoly funding for fields which are related to regulatory efforts, and much of that funding is spent with a foregone conclusion in mind,” Dr. Pat Michaels, the Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute who was not involved in the study, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “We don’t fund billions and billions of dollars of climate research each year to find that global warming isn’t a problem. Politics has intruded into the scientific process.” Due to this monopoly, scientists also have a huge incentive to tweak, or outright fake, statistical analyses to make results seem significant or to align with government priorities. A growing number of scientists have noticed the wave of retractions, especially among social scientists. Polling indicates that such consequences are causing science itself to become less trusted. “It also raises legitimate and disturbing questions as to whether accepting research funding from federal agencies is inherently unethical or not—modern agencies clearly have conflicts similar to those that are accepted and well understood for industry research sponsors,” Edwards and Roy continue in the study. “Given the mistaken presumption of research neutrality by federal funding agencies, the dangers of institutional research misconduct to society may outweigh those of industry-sponsored research.” A study found that 34 percent of researchers self-report that they have engaged in “questionable research practices,” including “dropping data points on a gut feeling” and “changing the design, methodology, and results of a study in response to pressures from a funding source,” whereas 72 percent of those surveyed knew of colleagues who had done so. Virginia Tech researchers note that the National Science Foundation estimates that research misconduct creates over $110 million in annual costs. “The second problem is that universities are biased towards federal funding, and will thus always be cheer-leading towards a dire view and treat people who don’t share that view very badly,” Dr. Michaels continued. “We’ve seen that repeatedly in climate science. There are enormous selective pressures to publish research that is dire and not publish research that is not. We’re creating biased canons of research because nobody will get a federal grant to study if global warming will have beneficial effects. The peer reviewers have a vested interest in making sure that the gravy train keeps rolling down the track.” In addition to outright fraud, these incentives lead to researchers not even bothering to write up negative results, as scientific journals tend to only publish the flashiest and most popular research. This biases the scientific canon and leads to duplication of research. Only seemingly groundbreaking research can lead to government grant money, scientific prizes, and potential tenure track jobs. “The entire American model of getting published, getting funded, then getting promoted means that people aren’t publishing negative results,” Michaels told TheDCNF. They’re only publishing flashy research. Getting published in Science, Nature or Cell is a ticket to future funding, promotion and tenure. This is giving young scientists an incentive to go into flashy fields that might get them on television, not important ones. This has created systematic problems in science.” As a result of these problems, researchers have a documented tendency to find evidence of phenomenons they happen to believe in and to reject observations that are unpopular with federal funders. In a survey of two thousand research psychologists conducted in 2011, over half admitted they selectively reported experiments, which gave the result they were after.

1126,"Hillary Clinton is looking to channel some more Barack Obama magic — although she promises not to incite a civil war if her strategy doesn't work. ""I wouldn't take up arms. That might be a little extreme,"" Clinton told Zach Galifianakis on Between Two Ferns, a mock interview show hosted by the comedian, when asked what she'd do if she lost the presidential election. Clinton added that if her quest for the White House were to fail she would stay in the country to try to prevent Donald Trump from ""destroying the United States."" Story Continued Below Some analysts credit the president's March 2014 appearance on Between Two Ferns with helping boost enrollment in Obamacare right when his administration needed it the most. And in an episode posted Thursday, Clinton decided to see if it could boost her campaign. Her team has admitted that is struggling to reach millennials, a demographic ripe for the show's humor. Joking about those who have questioned her judgment in recent days, Clinton said her appearance would probably prove her detractors right. As with Obama, Galifianakis left few topics untouched. He riffed on Clinton’s time as secretary of state. “How does Obama like his coffee?” he asked before questioning how many words per minute Clinton could muster. Galiafinakis also made light of Clinton's recent bout of pneumonia and questioned just how on earth she lost Scott Baio's vote to Donald Trump. ""You know, Zach, those are really out-of-date questions, you need to get out more,"" Clinton retorted when asked blatantly sexist questions. ""I could send you some pamphlets."" The 46-year-old comedian also snuck in a 1990s hip-hop reference on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, asking Clinton if she was “down with TPP.” The Democratic nominee helped pave the way for the agreement as secretary of state, but now opposes it. But the sharpest moments came at the expense of Clinton’s opponent. Asked what tie Donald Trump might wear to the first presidential debate on Monday night, Clinton said probably a red power one. But when Galifianakis asked how a “white power tie” would fit, Clinton joked that such a hue might be more appropriate. In another dig at Trump, Galifianakis said the show was sponsored by the New York businessman — courtesy of the now discontinued Trump Steaks. Clinton said she would be “afraid to eat them.” Galifianakis ended the interview by asking: ""What's the best way to reach you? Email?""",1,0,0
1011,"Accused of a “pay to play” scheme with Donald Trump, a defiant Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi broke her silence with the state’s news media Tuesday to say that she had no regrets in accepting a $25,000 political contribution from the Republican at the same time her office said it was examining fraud allegations against Trump University that it ultimately didn’t pursue. “Donald Trump did not get a pass,” Bondi told reporters. Story Continued Below Bondi told reporters that the contribution, made to her political committee amid her 2014 reelection campaign, had no bearing on her office’s decision to not join a civil fraud lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Trump University, which was defunct by the time she first took office in 2011. “There never was an investigation into Donald Trump by this office,” Bondi said. Bondi’s first political opponent in 2010, former state senator and federal prosecutor Dan Gelber, recently said she should at least have returned the check to Trump while the New York case was pending. But Bondi on Tuesday said she didn’t return the check because it would have looked as if it were a bribe. “If I had returned it you would have reported ‘Bondi accepted a bribe, got caught and returned it.’ That's how the reporting goes,” Bondi said. “And so, no, there was nothing improper about it. So there was no reason to return it.” Nonetheless, when controversy recently flared over the donation again, Bondi’s committee tried to return the check but Trump wouldn’t accept it. Scores of complaints against Trump University and he related Trump Institute were filed during the term of her predecessor, Bill McCollum, who did not investigate. At the time she collected the contribution, only one additional complaint against Trump University had been filed with her office and, Bondi said, she was unaware of the complaint when she solicited the contribution from Trump. The attorney general’s office fields tens of thousands of complaints yearly. Still, the timing of Bondi’s solicitation and acceptance of the check from Trump in 2013 have made the two Republicans an easy target for Democrats who have filed ethics complaints, accused her of participating in a “pay to play” scheme and called for independent investigations. Trump once said that he gives money to politicians ""because when I want something, I get it. When I call, they kiss my ass.” But Trump said he never discussed Trump University with Bondi and backed her because she’s a friend. As for why her office didn’t take the case, Bondi said her office referred Florida-based complainants – many of whom were elderly people who claimed they were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars – to New York because Trump University was based in that state. Bondi has bristled at the negative press coverage and said that it’s wrong to question her pro-consumer record. “We have returned billions of dollars to consumers since I have been in office,” she said. Bondi has been dogged by the timing of the Trump donation and her office’s inaction since her 2014 reelection campaign – only to see the issue roar back to life when she endorsed Trump in Florida the day before the March 15 Republican presidential primary that he handily won. The issue died down until last month, when Trump began calling out Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by accusing her of using the Clinton Foundation as a pay-to-play scheme. Democrats hit back by pointing fingers at Bondi. ""My charity helps people, his is used to pay off your attorney general,"" Bill Clinton said at a Florida event earlier this month. Trump’s charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was ensnared in the Trump University controversy because it was used to donate the $25,000 check to Bondi’s committee. That broke IRS rules and Trump recently admitted to the Washington Post that he paid a fine over the error. The timing of the contribution was controversial from the start. On Aug. 24, Schneiderman announced his lawsuit against Trump University. Five days later, an Orlando Sentinel reporter called Bondi’s office to inquire about whether she would join the suit. “We are currently reviewing the allegations in the New York complaint,” a Bondi spokeswoman told the reporter. About this time – Bondi is unclear as to the details – she solicited the check from Trump. Though her upper-level staff discussed the Schneiderman complaint, she said she was unaware of it. On Sept. 14, the Orlando Sentinel reported the Trump University lawsuit and, the following day, Bondi began receiving regular updates about the New York-based case. On Sept. 17, Bondi's political committee And Justice for All deposited the Trump check. The contribution was spotted by Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell on Oct. 15, who said the timing “looks awfully fishy.” But Bondi described the contribution, among the largest to her committee, as relatively routine. “I was calling friends and family and many, many people because I was running for reelection,” Bondi said.",1,0,0
372,"Delaware, Ohio (CNN)This time of year in Delaware, Ohio they like a close race with plenty of mud and lots of noise. It's not the rollicking presidential race but the Rough Truck competition at the county fair. But even here, politics are never far away. Across the midway in the merchants' barn, you'll find booths for both political parties. And just like the polls in Ohio, the booths are pretty close -- maybe too close. ""We had a life size cut out of Hillary Clinton but somebody took it,"" said a Democratic volunteer. The volunteer wasn't pointing any fingers but this year the political shenanigans aren't limited to the fair grounds. In this key battleground state, both campaigns are reaching out to some very unlikely voters. For the Trump campaign, that would be Jeff Hill. ""Yeah, Donald Trump""s who I'm voting for,"" Hill said. 2016: Last call for working class whites? He is a disaffected Democrat, drawn by Trump's promise to ""make America great again."" Hill is exactly the demographic Trump appeals to -- older, white and blue collar. Census numbers show Ohio has more voters like him than any other battleground state. It explains why Trump is in Ohio almost every week, showing up on traditional Democratic turf like factory towns, coal fields even Union halls. The Republican nominee recently appeared at the Canfield Fair, Ohio's largest county fair, where he drew a huge crowd in a county where Republicans rarely get more than 35% of the vote. Bob Paduchik, Trump's Ohio campaign director, credits Trump's message of security and fairer trade deals. ""I think that resonates not just with Republicans but also Independents and Democrats,"" he said. Trump isn't the only one after non typical voters. Donald Trump: 'There's a lack of spirit between the white and the black' The Clinton campaign has set its sights on suburban neighborhoods like Powell just north of Columbus, which is predominantly white, upper middle class and rich in Republicans. The Clinton campaign believes some voters here might side with the Democratic nominee if they're unable to stomach the idea of voting for Trump. Some Republicans don't need much selling. Sherrie Scarton has been a long time conservative voting for Ronald Reagan, John McCain and Mitt Romney. She even voted for Ohio Governor John Kasich in the primary. But she is not voting for Trump. ""Hillary's a smart woman and Trump is just, I hate to say it, he's a maniac,"" she said. But Paul Beck, a political science professor at The Ohio State University, isn't so sure this kind of political sniping is enough to win an election. He thinks many Ohio voters haven't made up their minds how they will vote or even if they will vote at all. ""What events occur between now and November 8th, what the debates look like what kind of terrorism activity -- there are all these kind of things that are out there in the firmament that can have an impact on what people end up doing in Election 2016,"" Beck said. When asked whether anyone has the Buckeye State wrapped up, Beck's answer was simple: ""I don't think so."" ",1,0,0
759,"In the wake of the bombs found in the Chelsea area of New York, Seaside Heights, and Elizabeth, NJ, we’ve received a letter from a Marine, known only as “J”, that wanted his voice heard, amidst the sea of political nonsense on the mainstream media. Here it is, unedited. Dear Obama, Hillary, and liberals scared of the “T” word, I’ve served my entire adult life in the United States Marine Corps, and I love this country, but that’s not important, because a man is judged in life by his actions, not his words. When you were given the task of protecting America, instead of giving people the tools to do it themselves, you treated them like children that couldn’t be trusted with their own safety. You stripped away their freedoms and promised them that you had everything under control. You allowed un-vetted, America-hating refugees that pledged allegiance to ISIS and other radical regimes and ideologies to walk freely, while they plotted to destroy the country from within. That’s exactly how you topple an empire without firing a single shot, and you’re falling for it like a bunch of amateurs. Repeat after me: You are not equipped to handle this. You’ve built your entire agenda on the false notion that fundamentalist Muslims either don’t exist, or can’t harm us because they’re on the other side of the world. Well, take a wild guess what happens when you import them to our shores and tell them that anyone criticizing Islam should be shunned, no matter how suspicious they act. It’s how you end up with attacks like the one in San Bernardino, and how you get bombings in New York City, Elizabeth, and Seaside Heights, where Marines were staging a summer run for charity, with the exact same IEDs I’ve seen used to kill my brothers and sisters while serving in the Middle East. When George W. Bush said “Fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them here,” this is what he was talking about. The fight is here, and you might as well have sent them a written invitation. If you’re too scared to say it, I will: These bombings were a textbook definition of terrorism. It doesn’t get any more clear, and every minute that goes by that you ignore it, the men willing to kill innocent people grow stronger. These attacks were enacted by those who want to literally terrorize our way of life. They hate our freedoms, and want – above all else –  to control us, much in the way that you want to control our actions, speech, and political motivations. But America is better than that. We’re not children that need to be led by the hand into a den of wolves. We’re the country of prosperity, strength, and built on the idea that we don’t take threats kindly. We have the most advanced military in the world, and a God-fearing citizenry that, unlike your liberal friends, won’t kneel to evil men. We’re the real America that you’re actively trying to silence, that gets things done by working together and ensuring that anyone coming in to the country better have a damn good reason for doing it. We support the police, that put their lives on the line when disarming a bomb, despite your best efforts to call them all racist monsters. We’re the ones going to work to keep the country running while the entitled brats that voted for you go on social media and complain about why life isn’t fair. We are the people you come running to when shit hits the fan, and we will stand no longer while you try to destroy this country by kowtowing to terrorists and fill pointless speeches with nothing but empty words and lies to the America public. The way I see it, this leaves you with three options: Take action, step down, or let America run over you. The choice is yours. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you. -J   ",0,0,1
1278,"""That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing ... and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business"" — Hillary Clinton It’s a favorite line of almost all politicians, and Hillary Clinton has used it before. But small businesses are not in fact the job creators. That role belongs to new businesses. One recent study used Census data to look at job creation in 2005. It found that startups created 3.5 million net new jobs—a million more than were created in the entire private sector. In other words, non-startup businesses were responsible that year for a 1 million job decline in employment.",1,0,0
1439,"I watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and I have something to say about each of them here today. The shooting in Tulsa, where I live, is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man. Not quite. Terence Crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long. He had been arrested at least 12 times previously. They found PCP in his stalled SUV. What the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised. He was indeed unarmed, but as you will see in the video below, he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police. He kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something. That is when a white, female officer shot him fatally. His attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot. Two officers fired simultaneously – one a taser and one a gun. It was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up. From my viewpoint, the officer followed procedure. Was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy? No, that is not how they are trained. The guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me. Hundreds showed up in Tulsa last night to protest… it was Black Lives Matter again. Originally, people said he was a pastor… not true, he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort. Now, onto North Carolina, where the black man was armed, shot and killed as well… by a black police officer.  From Gateway Pundit: Protests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina Tuesday after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer. The man was reportedly shot by a black officer. Protesters attacked police, hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser. The shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte. According to WBTV, officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm. Lamont Scott got out of the vehicle “armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject.” Black Lives Matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting. They’re hurling water bottles at police. Twelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters rioted and looted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. His daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven, reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed. That’s touching, but it’s not reality according to the police and just as in Tulsa, I’m far more willing to believe the police here than BLM. According to officers, they were looking for a suspect when they came across Scott in his car. They were in plain clothes and ordered Scott out of his car. He got out with a gun and then got back in. He got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he was an armed threat. A gun was recovered from the scene. Several hundred rioters went to town last night in Charlotte. They threw bricks and water bottles at the police. The police lobbed tear gas at the rioters. The BLM asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street. They tried to loot a Walmart and were pushed back by police. They destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media. They set trucks on fire as well. “We out like the Taliban!” one rioter could be heard crying on a Facebook Live broadcast of the protests, shortly after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. After 11 pm, the situation grew more severe, with several people successfully trashing a police SUV. The police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds. I didn’t see any, but I’ll bet pepper spray was used as well. Some protesters were heard yelling ‘Black Lives Matter!’ and ‘Hands up, don’t shoot!’. They held up a sign saying ‘Stop Killing Us!’ and ‘It was a book!’, making reference to the object Scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead. Officer Brentley Vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot Scott, WCCB reports. Officer Vinson, who has worked at the department since July of 2014 and is also black, has been placed on paid on administrative leave, as is standard procedure in such cases.

390,"(CNN)Investigators have now pieced together a detailed timeline of Ahmad Rahami's movements from the time when they say he left bombs in Seaside Park, New Jersey to his capture in Linden two days later, law enforcement sources tell CNN. Based on the new information, investigators now believe Rahami went back to his family's Elizabeth, New Jersey home after the Chelsea bombings and was seen there by his family. In law enforcement interviews with family members, Rahami was described as behaving normally. According to the officials, his return home appears to be in a time period before Rahami was publicly identified as a suspect in the bombings. The federal complaint filed against Rahami describes how he came to Manhattan about two hours before the first blast on West 23rd Street in Chelsea, but does not explain a three-hour gap from then to when he is believed to have left the city via the Lincoln Tunnel at approximately 11:30 p.m., around the same time the NYPD and New York City mayor were hold their first news conference regarding the nights' terror. RELATED: Ahmad Khan Rahami: What we know about the bombing suspect Investigators have been aided both by surveillance footage as well as tracking of his phone, which had no cellular service but used available Wi-Fi. While a timeline has been created, investigators are still not clear where Rahami allegedly built the bombs he used, according the multiple sources. But one source familiar with the investigation remarked that the bombs reflected a skilled hand at assembly. Rahami himself remains in the hospital. In a federal court filing Thursday, lawyers from the US attorney's office in New Jersey wrote that they've been informed by Rahami's medical team that ""he is currently incapacitated and intubated. As such, he is not in sufficient physical health for presentment to the Court -- even at a bedside proceeding."" While investigators have talked to the family, they are still seeking more information on what, if anything, they knew about Rahami's intentions. According to law enforcement sources, it was the cell phone of Rahami's younger sister that contained the video of him ""lighting the fuse"" of a partially buried cylindrical object, followed by ""a loud noise and flames, followed by billowing smoke."" The complaint alleges that event took place two days before the bombings and describes how laughter is heard on the video before Rahami returns into the frame and is seen picking up the object. So far, investigators have no information to suggest the sister knew of Rahami's plans. RELATED: Where did Ahmad Khan Rahami travel? Rahami's wife has returned to the US after talking with the FBI in Dubai, according to law enforcement officials. She told investigators in Dubai that she had no knowledge of her husband's activities and is expected to talk more with the FBI now that she is back in the US. Sources tell CNN that it now appears that she left in June and a previously booked ticket to return this week. ",1,0,0
643,"Milwaukee Country Sheriff David Clarke told Neil Cavuto of FOX News that the behavior of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night, riots which resulted in the injury of at least a dozen police officers trying to stop the mayhem and anarchy, was “primitive” and “subhuman” and resembled the kind of reaction you’d typically see in a “third-world nation.” After Cavuto pointed out that major news headlines in the Democrat Media Complex, ranging from the Washington Post to the New York Times, conveniently left out the fact that Keith Lamont Scott, the black man shot by a black police officer, was armed and refused to drop his weapon, according to police, Sheriff Clarke, as is always the case, did not mince words in describing both the media malpractice as well as the rioters’ behavior. “It was done on purpose [the media leaving out that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun] to stoke up anger and resentment by the liberal mainstream media,” Sheriff Clarke asserted. “Look, what was on display last night was something was something that resembled something you’d see in third-world nations like Haiti. This doesn’t represent the good city of Charlotte, North Carolina in the United States. You saw primitive behavior on display — at best primitive behavior — and at worst subhuman as people just reacted to circumstances.” “It’s not a socially acceptable response to people’s frustration and what they may not know,” Sheriff Clarke assessed.

464,"(CNN)Voters using Google to research candidates in competitive House races this year might not realize that the ""voter guide"" that pops up in their browser is actually funded by a House Republican political group. The new digital tactic has frustrated Democrats who claim the site gives the appearance of being non-partisan when it instead presents GOP attack lines. The campaign manager for LuAnn Bennett, a Democratic candidate in Northern Virginia who is challenging GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, found ""voterguide2016.com"" when he was searching his boss' name. While the layout and biographical information was fairly straightforward, the language on the campaign matchup immediately resembled GOP talking points. The ""Need to Know"" section describes Bennett's record as ""making promises she doesn't keep, like promising to build a preschool and daycare center with green space and a playground for the DC community. However, she never completed it."" The ""On the Issues"" area proclaims Bennett supported ""President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, even though it allows Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, the ability to eventually produce its own nuclear weapons."" On Comstock the site describes the freshman lawmaker as ""an independent leader"" and lists several issues that are top items on the minds of voters in the area: ""Opioids, traffic congestion, Metro funding -- Barbara has been in the thick of today's public policy debates."" At first glance the ""voterguide2016.com"" website looks like a neutral source. It features pictures of candidates of both parties in more than two dozen districts, with maps and sections labeled ""trending"" and ""candidates."" It doesn't specify that a ""Republican"" created it. But if you scroll all the way down to the bottom you find in small print the initials for the party committee that indicate it is a biased webpage -- ""Paid for by the NRCC and not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee. www.nrcc.org"" The NRCC is the Capitol Hill-based National Republican Congressional Committee, the main political arm for House Republicans. Democratic campaigns in roughly eight swing House races realized that the GOP strategy involved not only creating the site, but also buying geo-targeted Google search terms to drive people to it. When voters in these districts type in candidate names the search engine lists this Republican generated page at the top of the results. It's not against any rules, but Democrats who reviewed the sections and what is designed to look like analysis on the site told CNN the tactic was ""misleading and underhanded."" Robert Howard, spokesman for Bennett's campaign, criticized Comstock's party for the strategy, telling CNN, ""Without a record to stand on and an agenda more in line with Trump than her constituents, it's no shock she and her allies would resort to deceiving voters with a fake website."" But according to advertising strategists this approach is a natural extension of how the parties already use contrasting messages. Outside advocacy groups regularly prepare voter guides to give to voters to specify which candidates back their causes. ""Over 40% of all digital advertising is search. It would be silly to ignore this, whether you are selling soap or political candidates,"" one leading digital ad strategist, who is not affiliated with either political party, told CNN. The NRCC's ""independent expenditure"" or ""IE"" arm is responsible for the site not the committee itself, according to one senior Republican source. This separate group uses millions to run ads and support GOP candidates but cannot coordinate with the NRCC or individual campaigns. No one from the IE would talk to CNN about what they are spending on the site or why they chose to use the model it on a voter guide. Independent expenditure groups are established by both party committees and frequently produce some of the more negative political ads during the campaign season. They give the candidates and the party some cover because while they can't talk directly about their content, they can mimic messaging to help reinforce how races are framed. Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the NRCC views the new website as part of the broader effort to reach voters, telling CNN Republicans are ""constantly working to find new, creative, and innovative ways to target voters online."" Many House candidates on both sides already establish websites to attack their opponents. But when they buy the domain name election laws require that they disclose the campaign is behind the effort. For example, the Bennett campaign bought ""stoptrumpcomstock.com"" which links the GOP congresswoman to Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, who is unpopular in the district. Democratic campaign operatives maintain that this particular voter guide site is in a different category because it is an attacking candidates under the premise that it is presenting unbiased information without making it clear that one political party is paying. Martin, not surprisingly, disagrees, telling CNN, ""While Democrats might cry foul because they want to continue to hide from their records, the NRCC is happy to make their positions known in a smart and completely transparent way digitally."" It's unclear how much traffic the site will get, and whether it will translate into actual votes in November. Democrats will have to decide whether it's worth shifting money out of ad budgets earmarked for television commercials on local stations, which are the most expensive line item with the broadest reach, or to counter with their own digital response.

1079,"The anti-Donald Trump movement is on its death bed, the Republican presidential nominee boasted on Wednesday. “You’ll hear about these Never Trumpers, who are dying. Right now they’re on respirators, OK,” Trump said in response to a question about whether he will stand firm on his commitment to naming “true constitutionalists” to the Supreme Court. Story Continued Below Trump cited an “amazing” Wall Street Journal report “about all of the support that we’re getting.” The real estate mogul appears to be referring to a story published online late Monday in which the Journal reported that billionaires Sheldon Adelson and Joe Ricketts plan to pump millions of dollars into Trump and a pro-Trump super PAC. “From lots of rich people even,” Trump said of the fresh support he’s getting. “They’re coming in. These were Never Trump, Never Trump, Never Trump and now they’re — believe me, they see lower taxes, they see cutting the regulations, they see job creation, which is so important, and it’s really been amazing.” “And one of the things that they see and that you people see,” he told the group of pastors inside a Cleveland church, “is that — and so important — the judges. So I picked 11 judges. Very, very much into the world of the Constitution because we have people that, in some cases, not — I think in all cases — will have absolutely no — the Constitution will have no bearing on their decisions, OK, if somebody else gets it.

729,"Should he or shouldn’t he? Should debate moderator Lester Holt “fact-check” the candidates?  That is one of the big questions about tonight’s debate at Hofstra, University. IMHO Being a moderator at a debate is a lot like being an umpire at a baseball game. If you leave the game talking about the umpire it means the umpire screwed up. But just like major decisions in my household, the question of fact-checking is not my decision; it’s the moderator’s and there is pressure on him from team Clinton and the liberal media to play truth police as well as moderate the debate. In 2012, Candy Crowley was more than a moderator at the Hofstra debate. She was an active participant not allowing Romney to answer Obama’s attacks, and incorrectly fact-checking the Republican candidate. The Hofstra debate in 2012 will always be known as the one Candy Crowley screwed up. It is also known as the one where Candy Crowley stalked me. I was in the spin room for that debate and she kept trying to take over my computer. That experience is one of the reasons I decided not to go this year (well that and the fact that I didn’t get credentialed). Candy Crowley’s faux pas changed the momentum of the race. Barack Obama lost the first debate badly, and Romney was winning debate number two, until Crowley got involved.

1380,"This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it. In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.   Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.” He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”  .@realDonaldTrump slams ""dishonest"" CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as 'bombing' pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016   Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

1005,"George Soros is pumping $500 million into migrant- and refugee-founded businesses and other initiatives, the billionaire investor announced Tuesday, noting that his hope is other investors will follow suit. “Our collective failure to develop and implement effective policies to handle the increased flow has contributed greatly to human misery and political instability—both in countries people are fleeing and in the countries that host them, willingly or not,” Soros wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published online Tuesday. “Migrants are often forced into lives of idle despair, while host countries fail to reap the proven benefit that greater integration could bring.” Story Continued Below While acknowledging that governments should play a key role “by creating and sustaining adequate physical and social infrastructure,” Soros pointed to “power of the private sector” as a critical need, too. In response to the Obama administration’s recently announced call to action for U.S. companies to play a larger role in the refugee crisis, Soros wrote, “I have decided to earmark $500 million for investments that specifically address the needs of migrants, refugees and host communities.” “I will invest in startups, established companies, social-impact initiatives and businesses founded by migrants and refugees themselves,” he continued. “Although my main concern is to help migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, I will be looking for good investment ideas that will benefit migrants all over the world.” Soros said his nonprofit-owned investments will complement his foundation’s philanthropic contributions and cover various sectors, including emerging digital technology. It “seems especially promising as a way to provide solutions to the particular problems that dislocated people often face,” he said. “Advances in this sector can help people gain access more efficiently to government, legal, financial and health services. Private businesses are already investing billions of dollars to develop such services for non-migrant communities.” Investments, he added, “are intended to be successful—because I want to show how private capital can play a constructive role helping migrants.” Adding that he plans to work with organizations like the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee to create principles that will guide his investments, Soros said his goal “is to harness, for public good, the innovations that only the private sector can provide. I hope my commitment will inspire other investors to pursue the same mission.”",1,0,0

424,"Washington (CNN)Kix Brooks, one half of the country music duo Brooks and Dunn, is not buying the gloom and doom expressed on the campaign trail about America's declining greatness -- often espoused by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Dierks Bentley on Donald Trump and the country music vote ""We've always been great, as far as I'm concerned,"" the country music artist, whose classic 2001 hit ""Only America"" with Ronnie Dunn became an anthem for patriotism following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, told CNN. ""There's a lot of stuff that we can do better and there's a lot of stuff that we do better than anybody in the world, but that's life. That's our project as Americans -- we always work to be better,"" he continued. But Brooks, who considers himself to be ""fairly conservative,"" is not optimistic that the next commander-in-chief will be able to make good on his or her promises to solve some of the country's most divisive issues if Washington remains gridlocked and the US continues to be as ""polarized"" as it is today. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to work with Congress to implement comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to take on the gun lobby to institute ""common sense"" gun-control measures. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border between the US and Mexico. CHECK OUT: #GetPolitical — A CNN Politics original series ""I think all the issues that are on the table, from gun control to immigration, are so complicated, there is no easy answer,"" Brooks told CNN. ""None of these problems are going to be solved overnight or probably in the next four years no matter what either candidate says."" On gun culture Lamenting the hostility that has often plagued the gun-control debate on both sides, the ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" artist said that the right to bear arms is an American principle that ""should be respected."" ""We do have a Second Amendment and it's something that should be respected and discussed in a civilized way,"" Brooks said. ""My only concerns are that Second Amendment rights are discussed with so much ferocity that sometimes we don't hear what each other is saying."" Brooks, who is an avid hunter, grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, along the Red River, and as he toured the country to play music over the last two decades, he witnessed a stark cultural divide between rural and urban America when it comes to guns. While Americans in rural America ""never considered what a gang was,"" Brooks said, those in urban America also don't understand that ""having a shotgun in the back of your pick up truck was also just a way of life"" for Americans like him. Brooks is a strong supporter of states' rights and said that gun-control solutions to address gang violence and gun violence in American cities are not necessarily needed or effective in rural America. ""I don't feel like what's good for California is good for Tennessee, is good for Louisiana, is good for New York City,"" Brooks said,"" adding, that local ""leaders in our own communities know much better what our problems are and how we should deal with them than Washington, D.C., does."" And as for election 2016, Brooks did not say who he is voting for but said if he hears a candidate speaking along those lines, he tends ""to listen more closely."" On 'Only in America' Many artists have protested when politicians with views they oppose use their songs during campaign events. However, when then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama played Brooks and Dunn's ""Only in America"" at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, that was not the case. ""Seems ironic that the same song Bush used at the Republican Convention last election would be used by Obama and the Democrats now,"" Brooks said at the time. ""Very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans."" Brooks, who was a supporter of President George W. Bush, said that he co-wrote ""Only in America"" with his friend and music producer Don Cook -- a Democrat -- after they spent day in the woods, riding four-wheelers near Brooks' farm and talking about how grateful they are to be Americans. ""The song was never meant to be political in any way. It still isn't,"" Brooks said. ""The song is patriotic ...

426,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday. The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%. Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included. Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump. Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament. With the candidates' health on the minds of voters following Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis earlier this month, respondents were asked who has more stamina to be president -- 53% said that Trump does, while just 39% said the same of Clinton. Voters gave Clinton the edge over Trump on a series of key issues. On terrorism (52% to 41%), immigration (54% to 41%), creating good jobs (49% to 43%) and trade (52% to 42%), Clinton is viewed as the better candidate. The McClatchy-Marist poll was conducted through September 15 to 20, and surveyed 758 likely voters. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.6 points. ",1,0,0
227,"Allow me to begin by saying former DNC chair Howard Dean is the f*ckingÂ . After tweeting that Donald Trump might be on cocaine â a reasonable observation based on the GOPâs actions during the first presidential debate â he could have backed down under scrutiny. He could have caved and apologized. Instead, he made his case. Dean, a physician who is qualified to speculate â though in his own words not diagnose without examining Trump in person â responded to criticism of his remarks on MSNBC. âI donât make diagnosis on the television, itâs medically improper,â he told Kate Snow Tuesday, a subtle jab at Trump and his legion of Fox News âdoctorsâ feverishly trying to diagnose Clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other. âBut I donât think this was a ridiculous idea. Something funny was going on with Trump last night.â Something âridiculousâ was indeed going on. Trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories, attacking his opponentâs âstaminaâ based on a minor illness, interrupting Clinton constantly, guzzling water, sweating profusely, and other things that would be expected from his meth-addled Twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate. âHereâs the interesting constellation: he sniffs during the presentation, which is something that users do. He also has grandiosity, which is something that accompanies that problem. He has delusions, Iâm not talking about being crazy, but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of 100 million people,â Dean said. âHe thinks somehow heâs not going to get caught, that is delusional.â He has trouble with pressured speech,â the former Vermont governor added. âHe interrupted, as you pointed out, Hillary Clinton twenty-nine times. He couldnât keep himself together.â âDo I think at 70 years old he has a cocaine habit? Probably not,â Dean concludes.Â âBut itâs something that I think would be interesting to ask him, to see if he ever had a problem with that.â Asked for clarification if he thinks Trump has a âcocaine habit,â Dean replied âI donât think he has a cocaineÂ ,â placing special emphasis on the word âhabit.â In other words, it might be a stretch to say Trump isÂ  to cocaine, but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate. In an effort to deflect from the allegation, Trump assured the public that he just had a cold, but Stephen Colbert put it best when he said The Donald âsounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine.â We canât know for sure if Trump has ever been treated for addiction, as he refuses to release his records â and since Trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds Hillary Clinton, itâs not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine (especially given the crazy, whacked-out bonkers stuff he says in public).

188,"Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it’s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans. Data analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians. Contrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent. So while it’s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton’s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina. Again, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November. Democrats shouldn’t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.

585,"If you are one of the GOP candidates who is still saying #NeverTrump, you have been warned. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Sunday suggested he could say “never mind” to the “Never Trump” candidates should they try to make another run for the presidency. That is one way to get your troops to fall in line. Will the big heads get the message?  As Written, Reported and seen first on Fox News: Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Sunday suggested he could say “never mind” to the “Never Trump” candidates should they try to make another run for the presidency. Priebus said the former primary challengers who’ve refused to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could face consequences if they fail to back Trump in the stretch-run to Election Day. “Those people need to get on board,” Priebus told “Face the Nation.” “And if they’re thinking they’re going to run again some day, I think that we’re going to evaluate the process – of the nomination process and I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them.” Priebus didn’t specifically name the group, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush are the most prominent ex-GOP primary candidates to refuse to support Trump. Cruz and Bush were locked in particularly nasty verbal spats during the campaign with Trump, who termed his opponents “Lyin’ Ted” and “Low-Energy Jeb.” Though Kasich and Trump rarely went toe-to-toe, Kasich was the last Trump challenger to drop out of the race, and despite the Republican National Convention being held in Cleveland, the Ohio governor didn’t set foot in Quicken Loans Arena. Cruz spoke at the convention, but he was booed off the stage when he told the assembled, largely pro-Trump crowd to “vote your conscience.” Despite the intra-party squabbles, however, Priebus made his case by pointing to a pledge that each primary candidate signed vowing to support the eventual Republican nominee…..

264,"Washington (CNN)New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong to suggest that the New York bombing suspect shouldn't receive medical care. ""I understand the anger that Donald Trump is speaking to (but) this is America and this is our system and you are innocent until proven guilty and you have a right to counsel and that is the Constitution of the United States of America,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""And that's what makes us who we are. That's what makes us special. And if you give that up, Alisyn, then you have defeated yourself,"" Cuomo, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president this cycle, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""That is the code of democracy and freedom. That is what they resent about us. So don't lose your soul in the process. Because that is the soul of America."" Trump complained Monday about Ahmad Khan Rahami being offered medical treatment and legal assistance following his shootout with police. Rahami, the suspect in Saturday's bombings in New York and New Jersey, was captured Monday. Following a frantic manhunt and shootout, Rahami was shot multiple times before being taken to a hospital for surgery. ""He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he will probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer,"" Trump said at a Florida rally. But Cuomo said Tuesday that leaving a wounded Rahami ""on the streets"" would have been un-American. ""That's not who we are. That's not who we want to be. And that's not how we defeat the terrorists. We defeat the terrorists by staying true to who we are,"" he said. Cuomo also responded on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" to Trump's claim Monday that Rahami would have access to ""amazing hospitalization"" and be ""taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world."" ""Welcome to America,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Right? We have a system of jurisprudence. You are innocent until proven guilty. You have a right to counsel ... that is our system. And it's what makes this country special. It's what make this country great."" Cuomo praised law enforcement Tuesday for successfully capturing Rahami quickly. ""It was really a remarkable situation when you think about it,"" he said on ""New Day."" ""I think it's a statement of the time. We have gotten so sophisticated in law enforcement, especially in New York."" On Monday, Cuomo disputed Trump's assertion that police aren't doing their job because they are afraid of being accused of racial profiling. ""Our local police -- they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling,"" Trump said Fox News. Cuomo responded: ""I don't know how you could have been more aggressive than we were here."" Trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs ""I said as soon it as it happened that justice would be swift,"" he told Blitzer. ""I don't know how you can criticize that police activity. Look at the product, look at the result, look at how aggressive it was."" ",1,0,0

77,"Almost 20 percent of Americans surveyed said they could change their mind about the presidential election based on tonight’s face-off between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, according to the latest ABC News/Washington poll. In fact, 6 percent of Americans said there’s a “good chance” that tonight could swing their vote one way or another — more than the margin between the two candidates in most national polls over the last month. Here are the groups to watch for during tonight’s debate: 1. Young voters. Almost 3 in 10 young voters (28 percent) polled said they could switch their vote based on tonight’s face-off between Clinton and Trump. A broad 60 percent of these voters went for President Barack Obama in 2012, but many are threatening to vote for third-party candidates Gary Johnson or Jill Stein this year. 2. People who don’t like either candidate. A good number of Americans surveyed who said they don’t like either major party candidate said they could change their minds tonight. Twenty-seven percent of Americans who have an unfavorable view of both Clinton and Trump said they could change their minds, versus only 13 percent of those who like at least one of them. 3. Bernie Sanders supporters. A quarter of Americans polled who backed the Vermont senator during the Democratic primaries (26 percent) said they might flip candidates based on tonight’s debate. Only 74 percent of them said they’re voting for Clinton, with 9 percent going for Trump and 12 percent split between Johnson and Stein. 4. Independents. A quarter of Americans (24 percent) surveyed who are not affiliated with either political party said their votes could be up in the air during tonight’s debate. Trump has a statistically insignificant advantage among this group, 43 percent to Clinton’s 38 percent, with 10 percent going for Johnson and 2 percent for Stein. 5. People who are on the fence about voting. People who might not show up to the polls are also more likely to consider switching their votes. Only 11 percent of Americans polled who have followed the race “very closely” and 14 percent of those who were “absolutely certain” they will vote said they could change their minds. That’s compared with 24 percent and 25 percent of those who have followed the race less closely and were less certain to vote, respectively. 6. Unenthusiastic voters. Respondents who were “very enthusiastic” about voting for Clinton and Trump were largely set in stone: Only 9 percent of “very enthusiastic” Clinton backers and 3 percent of “very enthusiastic” Trump supporters said they could change their minds. That’s compared with 22 percent of less enthusiastic Clinton backers and 18 percent of less enthusiastic Trump supporters. 7. Weaker partisans and ideologues. Very strong partisans were less likely to be open to changing their votes tonight: Just 10 percent of strong conservatives, 12 percent of liberal Democrats and 6 percent of conservative Republicans said the debates could change their votes. White men without a college degree (13 percent) and people who make $100,000 per year or more (11 percent) were also less likely to be open to a flip tonight. Poll results come from an ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sept. 25. The survey was conducted by landline and cellular telephones Sept. 19 to 22, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including 651 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect, for the full sample and 4.5 points for likely voters.",1,0,0
1051,"When Donald Trump took his campaign to High Point, North Carolina, Tuesday, his topics ranged broadly from trade to immigration to terrorism. In other words, none of the hot-button issues that are currently roiling the political landscape in the battleground state that’s looking increasingly essential to his hopes of winning. Unlike the presidential contest in nearly every other swing state, North Carolina’s is framed this year by two local battles overshadowing almost everything else. Story Continued Below There is House Bill 2 — the so-called bathroom bill which has energized young liberals and older conservatives in what’s viewed by many as a battle for the soul of the state. Then there is the furor over voting rights, which has provided Democrats with a major organizational and energy boost among African-Americans. “The intensity that you see on the national level is on steroids in North Carolina, because not only do you have this presidential race where they’re both here all the time, you also have a highly-charged governor’s race and Senate race with the issues of HB2 and voting rights litigation all rolled up into one,” explained Bruce Thompson, a Raleigh attorney and a longtime, high-profile Hillary Clinton supporter in the state. “There cannot be another state that has that kind of intensity. It comes up in every conversation. It’s not just the insiders talking about it. It comes up on the sidelines of my daughter’s field hockey games."" The two issues form a unique backdrop in a place that suddenly occupies a pivotal role on a hardening electoral map. Top Clinton aides can’t envision a scenario in which Trump loses North Carolina but wins the White House. In a memo circulated to donors on Monday evening, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook framed the state’s 15 electoral votes as something close to a must-win for Trump. The Trump campaign is acting accordingly, with three straight weeks featuring visits to the state from the GOP nominee, including his rally Tuesday. His allies are hoping the polarizing politics surrounding HB2 and roughly 35 legal showdowns in Raleigh this month about voting rights will rally conservatives to his side, putting a GOP-leaning state squarely in his column, and stamping out Democrats' Southern advances in one of Clinton’s most frequently visited states. Democrats believe the local fireworks provide Clinton with an unprecedented chance to juice up enthusiasm among young voters, college-age whites and African-Americans — the groups she’s relying on to capture the state. The contentious governor’s race has set the tone, with GOP Gov. Pat McCrory and Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper locked in a contest that’s been so defined by McCrory’s signing of HB2 that Democrats have mulled how to saddle Trump with the governor’s baggage — a twist on the mechanics of the presidential race in other swing states, where Democrats have framed Trump as drag on down-ballot candidates. “It may be that what’s keeping North Carolina in play is that Hillary could be getting Cooper’s coattails,” said one veteran Democratic operative in the state. The Trump campaign did not respond to several requests for comment. The “bathroom bill” issue — which is controversial largely because of its provision that individuals may only use government-funded restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth — has become a defining one for Clinton, whose campaign has made a habit of seizing on local controversies in whichever state she’s visiting since the early days of her primary. North Carolina has seen businesses and some local entertainment staples flee since the bill’s passage in March, with few departures as politically stinging as the Atlantic Coast Conference’s decision to pull its college football championship game from Charlotte or the NCAA's move to ax seven in-state events — including men’s basketball tournament games. Wired Magazine this week estimated that the bill had cost North Carolina nearly $400 million already. ""They are huge things that are happening within the state and I think not only is it going to help us,” added Clinton’s states director, Marlon Marshall. “It’s going to help Democrats up and down the ticket.” According to an Elon University poll released Tuesday, 60 percent of likely voters said North Carolina’s national reputation is worse as a result of the passage of HB2. Clinton’s in-state forces have used the headlines to highlight what they say is Republican-led intolerance that has led to economic harm — a case that’s animated the highly educated white voters in the Research Triangle area who could carry her to victory. Speaking last week in Greensboro, where some of the basketball games would usually be played, Clinton hammered the message home: “Look at what’s happening with the NCAA and the ACC,” she said. “This is where bigotry leads, and we can’t afford it."" The Democratic nominee has also weighed in on the voting rights fight that’s been raging since the state implemented rules eliminating same-day registration and requiring an ID in 2013, calling such regulations “a blast from the Jim Crow past” in early September as she campaigned in Charlotte. Clinton’s in-state team has four lawyers working on staff to bolster her voter protection program, and Democratic attorneys there have been engaged in this fall’s fight since 2014. But the dispute returned to the forefront earlier this month after a series of legal rulings about the state’s voting laws — including one from the Supreme Court that restored one-stop early voting — pushed the onus onto the state’s counties to construct plans for approval by the Republican-led State Board of Elections. Democrats then piled lawyers in to work with the local proposals, guaranteeing they had legal representation in each of the more than 30 counties where there was a fight over the plan. Ensuring that voters can take advantage of one-stop early voting could help Clinton enormously with the state’s large population of rural African-Americans who are not registered voters. And it gave the Clinton campaign a chance to rally black voters in the cities around the idea that the restrictions were racially motivated in the first place. “There will be more early voting in North Carolina than there was in 2012,” explained Marshall, making the case that the very presence of more early voting will be a motivator. “That’s a way to energize our base, and get them to show up to the polls."" Trump, for his part, has also drilled down on North Carolina. The attention has paid off: He’s within 1 percentage point of Clinton according to the POLITICO Battleground States polling average. According to the new Elon poll, when including voters leaning toward one of the candidates, Trump and Clinton were deadlocked at 45 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson pulling 7 percent of the vote. Unlike Clinton, Trump's focus in North Carolina has been on an anti-trade deal message that especially resonates among older, white working class voters who have lost jobs in industries like textiles. ""Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through,"" he said at his High Point rally.",1,0,0
1457,"Next week’s debate may be the nation’s most widely watched Presidential debate in YEARS. That is, if both participants actually bother to show up.  Trump-enthusiast and Gateway Pundit owner Jim Hoft published an article today in which he says that an unnamed “conservative leader” contacted him stating that Hillary may be pulling out of Monday’s debate. Now this… A conservative leader wrote The Gateway Pundit Wednesday morning to share this news: Hearing smart guys say that Hillary may cancel the debate on Monday … Hillary may be trying to run out the clock because she thinks she is ahead. Could it be that Hillary Clinton pulls out of the debate, or is this just propaganda for Trump? Or even, a way to garner more interest for the much-awaited debate between the Republican and Democratic Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton?

657,"In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever, an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department of Justice and mainstream media have been unable (or unwillingly) to un-earth: Proof that Hillary  Clinton conspired to cover up her “un-wise” use of a private server and email scandal. Through the power of social media, a Twitter user @GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation. Paul Combetta, the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State, allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary’s name from classified emails. He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “stonetear” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs. In his requests for help from the public at large, Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “Unamed VIP Client” from email servers and archives. “Hello all,” one of the posts begins. “I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone. … Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?” The House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Reddit to save all relevant posts and data. Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish: proof of Hillary’s Clinton’s criminal activity. The investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question: is the screen name “stonetear” definitively Combetta? In not, the evidence is circumstantial. If so, the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up. To support the argument that “stonetear” is in fact Hillary Clinton’s IT specialist, @GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections: This story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them. As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee, the work of the American people, both as investigators like @GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot, will not remain silent.

1617,"(EDITOR’S NOTE: This video contains graphic content that may be emotionally disturbing for viewers.) A video of Keith Lamont Scott’s final moments, filmed by Scott’s wife, Rakeiya, has been made public. In the video, obtained by NBC News, Charlotte-Mecklenburg (CMPD) police officers are seen approaching the car where Scott, a father of seven, was waiting for his child’s school bus to arrive. Rakeiya Scott is heard shouting, “Don’t shoot him! He has no weapon!” while police are heard in the distance shouting at Keith Scott to “drop the gun.” “He doesn’t have a gun… he’s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine,” Rakeiya Scott said.  After four shots were fired, Scott is heard repeatedly shouting, “Did you shoot him?” And runs over to her husband’s car. “He better not be fucking dead, he better not be fucking dead, I know that fucking much,” Scott said as officers ordered her to come to them. “We are at 9453 Lexington Court, and these are the police officers who just shot my husband,” Rakeiya Scott said. “He better live.” From the angle of the recording, it is unclear as to what led up to the killing of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. As of this writing, CMPD officers have not released the body camera video of Scott’s death, despite calls from the community and even the New York Times editorial board to release it. Police were on the scene to search for a man with outstanding warrants, who was not Scott. However, Scott was nonetheless shot and killed by CMPD officers who allege he was brandishing a firearm. Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, told CBS News he was sitting in his car, waiting for his child’s school bus, and reading the Koran, which he did every day. “That’s a task for him every day, so he can be out there to get a special spot,” Walker said.”He sits in the truck and reads his book.”        ",0,1,0

984,"As a fifth-generation Rockefeller, I was raised on the practical standards of what used to be known as Rockefeller Republicanism and later, Reagan Republicanism. One of the guiding principles of this political philosophy was to reach across the aisle to make progress on issues that would best serve the American people. We were above all a problem-solving party that was fiscally disciplined, fully accountable, less inflexible on social issues, and willing to compromise in order to get things done. I’m sad to say that the commonsensical “party of the people,” of which I was once proud to be a member, no longer exists. But that doesn’t mean it can’t exist again. Indeed, ironically enough, Donald Trump’s rapacious presidential campaign has done so much to destroy the soul of the Republican Party that he might be just the thing that allows us to reinvent it altogether, and along lines that will appeal to millennials and beyond. Story Continued Below True, for now, the rise of this very un-Republican, doomsday-is-here candidate has driven many of us who remained in the party—what I like to think of as the reasonable, forward-thinking Republicans—away. Some used to call us moderates; I prefer the term pragmatists. Now, we’ve either drank the Trump Kool-Aid, are hiding in embarrassment, are just sitting this one out or have reluctantly joined the other side. Our best hope of avoiding extinction is Trump’s resounding defeat, a definitive sign that the Republican Party must evolve and change. But we should look on the positive side of this disaster. Trump is like an amateurish hacker who’s implanted a virus that has exposed the party’s outdated operating system—its too-narrow ideology. Now we can start from the ground up again, and to install this critical update, we need the startup attitude and energy of our digital generation. My hope is that some Rockefeller Republican code will be a part of this transformation, rebooting a legacy of pragmatism and public service. At least that is what I’m working on now. Millennials now number 83.1 million, the largest demographic in the United States and equal in voting power to baby boomers. So, instead of directing my own philanthropy into the wasteland of campaign finance, I’m seeking to get young Americans working on solutions. That’s why I’ve supported a national college program that brings together diverse groups of socially minded Republicans, Democrats and independents, to converse, brainstorm and resolve problems based on issues, rather than affiliations. The raw material is plainly there, among the younger generation, to restore the Republican Party to its rightful place as the Party of Reason. Millennials value integrity over intransigence, action over rhetoric and equality over elitism. A poll by the Harvard Institute of Politics noted that among potential voters age 18 to 29 what is valued most in a candidate is integrity, level-headedness and authenticity. According to a Pew report, a majority of young Republicans say immigrants strengthen America, corporate profits are too high, and stricter environmental laws are worth the cost. And among the one-third of millennials who affiliate with or lean Republican, just 31 percent have a mix of political values that are right-of-center, whereas 51 percent take a mix of liberal and conservative positions and 18 percent have consistently or mostly liberal views. Trump is like an amateurish hacker who’s implanted a virus that has exposed the party’s outdated operating system.” To move toward a more purposeful party platform, here are a few proposals that place sound policy before partisanship. While increasing border security (without building a nonsensical wall), create a system where undocumented immigrants can work towards legal status, not citizenship. Acknowledge the dangers of climate change and promote a 20-30 year transitional path from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources, which includes a revenue neutral carbon tax. Close the gun-show loophole and expand the market for smart handguns that can only be used by their owners. Form a bipartisan commission on tax reform that will require two ironclad criteria: revenue neutrality and the guarantee that recommendations would receive only an up-or-down vote preventing riders and amendments. In addition, to keep the swarms of lobbyists at bay, members of the House and Senate would have to wait a minimum of three years before becoming a consultant or lobbyist. The idea isn’t to go back in time and turn Republicanism into a kind of Norman Rockwell painting. We’re talking about the evolution of a new paradigm where some of the valued principles of the party are encoded with a state-of-the-art brand of logical thinking that addresses reality and gets government working again. *** I come to practical politics from a very personal perspective. At 19, I was in a horrific car crash and lost my right leg above the knee and the use of my right arm. This life crisis reframed everything, and I had to learn to look at challenges and obstacles through the simple prism of “either this is going to work or it isn’t.” Over time, my politics shifted, as well. Instead of caring about what was more conservative or more liberal, my focus turned to what’s doable and efficient. When he lost the Republican presidential nomination to Barry Goldwater in 1964, my great-uncle, Nelson Rockefeller, became one of the first victims of the extremist element’s rise in the party. During the campaign, he accused Goldwater of being out of touch with reality, which sounds disturbingly relevant today. My uncle, Jay Rockefeller, the only Democrat in the family to serve in public office, retired last year after 30 years in the Senate. While reliably liberal, he was always more concerned with policy than politics. He mourned the loss of a system where reasonable negotiation and collaborative deal making were mutually agreed upon standards. Hence my hope for the future of the party rests largely on the next generation of reasonable Republican leaders. Like many of those who identify as Republicans, I’m not a “RINO” (Republican In Name Only), but rather someone seeking to update essential but dying traditions from the inside of a party that is on the verge of falling apart. When I became eligible to vote in 1979, I was proud to be a Reagan Republican. Now, younger GOP supporters, who aren’t aligned with the party’s platform or want no part of a Trump candidacy, have no place to turn. As part of our college project, I sent out a request for opinions and feedback on today’s party platform. One note that was particularly moving was from a 25-year-old gay man named John, who preferred to remain anonymous. “I have found it very difficult to support the Republican Party, with the attractive free-market ideals clouded in divisive rhetoric and obstructionist tactics,” he wrote. “As a gay person, I have also been repelled by the Party's socially conservative agenda. If the Republican Party wants to survive and gain the support of my generation, it needs to become the party of Reason. My generation is largely nonreligious, supportive of our diverse citizens (including race, sexual orientation, etc.) and solution focused. I hope Republican leaders will consider this going forward. Now is the perfect time to reinvent the Party.” It is indeed time—or will be after November 8—from the rubble left behind by the Trump candidacy. The way to do that will be to remind ourselves what the party once stood for and what it was built on. If Ronald Reagan were talking to disheartened millennials today, that’s exactly what he would say: We’re the party that freed the slaves, the party of inclusion, the party of immigration. The harsh truth is Reagan wouldn’t even qualify as a Republican today—and he would call out a demagogue like Donald Trump as a perilous threat to traditional conservative tenets. Moreover, Reagan brought a sense of optimism and hope to a nation that had been worn down and divided and made people proud to be Americans again. Trump’s apocalyptic prophecies are anathema to the confidence and positivity Reagan inspired in us. There must be a sea change in the GOP definition of visionary leadership. We need to encourage millennials who identify with the party of Lincoln to start running for school boards, city councils and state legislatures, as well as develop online communities and databases. And to elect Republican representatives, senators and governors who reflect their values and stands on issues. This is where the next great Republican leaders and president will come from. I don’t approve of some of President Barack Obama’s policies, but I agree 100 percent when he says, “democracy isn’t a spectator sport.” For me, it’s time to be investing in GOP 2.0.",1,0,0
1309,"Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton has spent her “entire adult life” fighting the Islamic State and will never be able to defeat the terrorist group. Clinton retorted that Trump ""has no plan"" to fight the radical group, and put him on the defensive over his past support for the Iraq War. Story Continued Below The foreign policy section of Monday's debate touched on Russia, Iran, and nuclear weapons—but no subject animated the candidates like their exchanges about the terrorist militia's rise and which candidate is better-equipped to crush it. Repeating a pattern throughout the debate, Trump made his case with bold, and questionable, claims, while Clinton defended her position with less memorable but more factual assertions. With polls showing high voter anxiety over terrorism, Trump took the first shot on the subject early in the debate, with a charge that Clinton's web site had posted details of her war plan. ""You're telling the enemy everything you want to do,"" Trump said. ""No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."" That was a head-scratching claim, given that Clinton is 68 and the Syria-based group, also known as ISIS, has only existed in its current form since 2014. (A predecessor group was founded in 2004.) But Clinton ignored Trump's puzzling assertion. ""At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" she quipped. Clinton later added that while Trump has claimed he has a ""secret plan"" to fight ISIS, ""the only secret is that he has no plan."" Clinton took more seriously his charge—supported by many national security experts—that the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq had enabled ISIS's creation. ""They wouldn't even have been formed if you left some troops behind, like 10,000, or maybe something more than that,"" Trump said. President Barack Obama oversaw the exit of U.S. troops, which he celebrated at the time. Clinton was then serving as Obama's Secretary of State. But she countered that it was the George W. Bush administration which failed to reach an agreement with Iraq's government that would have allowed U.S. forces to remain in the country on terms acceptable to Washington. ""George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama,"" Clinton said. ""And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq was to get an agreement from the Iraqi government that would have protected our troops—and the Iraqi government would not give that."" Experts have debated that point for years, with some claiming that Obama never really wanted such an agreement and didn't try as hard as he could have to secure one. Yet some some former Obama officials—including the U.S. ambassador to Iraq at the time of the withdrawal, James Jeffrey— say that Clinton argued internally for maintaining a troop presence in the country beyond 2011. ISIS evolved from the group al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), founded in the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion of that country. The group was nearly wiped out by the U.S. military but regained strength after the American withdrawal, and as it joined the fight in Syria's civil war. In 2014, AQI cut ties to al Qaeda and renamed itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and is often called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. There is almost no expert support for Trump's longtime insistence, which he repeated Monday, that the U.S. should have seized Iraq's oil fields as a form of war booty, and that doing so would have allowed the U.S. to prevent ISIS's rise. ""Had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income,"" Trump said. Trump has argued for years that the U.S. should commandeer Iraq's oil, though he has not addressed basic questions like how many troops it would take and how the oil would be transported from a country sure to be hostile to the seizure of its most valuable commodity. Nor did Trump ever describe the plan in the past as a way to prevent militants from flourishing, even as many national security experts were doing so. Clinton, who cast a Senate vote to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2002, sought to turn Trump's talk of Iraq history back against him by citing his well documented comments in favor of the U.S. invasion before it happened. ""Donald supported the invasion of Iraq,"" she said. ""I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her,"" Trump said. Trump proceeded to claim he had ""numerous conversations"" with Fox News host Sean Hannity, in which he opposed the war, but of which there is no public record. The debate's moderator, Lester Holt, endorsed Clinton's version of events. ""The record shows otherwise,"" he told an irritated Trump. As he often has before, Trump again cited an August 2004 interview with Esquire as evidence of his opposition to the war. ""They did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started, I think in ‘04, but they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq,"" Trump said. But by that time, more than a thousand American troops had died in Iraq, photos documenting the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal had emerged, and public support for the occupation was falling fast. Clinton reiterated her pledge to ""intensify"" airstrikes against ISIS, enlist technology companies to track down on the group's Internet activities, and support Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground in Iraq and Syria—largely steps the Obama administration is already taking. Clinton did not repeat her past talk of establishing a ""no-fly zone"" in northern Syria. Clinton also raised the subject of Russia, pressing her campaign's recent charge that Trump is suspiciously respectful of Russian president Vladimir Putin and that he holds Kremlin-friendly views of NATO and Ukraine. ""There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald is very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin. But Putin is playing a very tough, long game here,"" Clinton said. Defying the strong consensus view of U.S. intelligence officials, Trump cast doubt on Russia's alleged role in the recent hack and exposure of Democratic National Committee emails. ""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia who broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but It could also be China, but it could also be lots of other people,"" Trump said. ""It also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?""",1,0,0

201,"This election will ask us to choose one of the following: an overqualified, dignified woman, or a fascist, xenophobic billionaire. The woman, Hillary Clinton, has dedicated her life to fighting for the rights and dignities of all, while the man, Donald Trump, has fought only for himself and his pockets. One group that tends to vote Democrat â but has been leaning a little more towards the right recently â are Jewish people. In 2008, 78 percent of Jewish Americans voted for President Obama, as did 74 percent in 2012. This year is different. Instead of facing off against John McCain or Mitt Romney, the Democrats are facing off against the definition of fascism and xenophobia. And they have a message to their grandchildren: vote for Hillary Clinton. Why? Because theyâve seenÂ before. In a video titled âA Message From Grandma & Grandpa: Weâve Seen This Before,â a group of elderly Jewish Americans plead with their younger generations to get out and vote, and warns against the type of man Donald Trump is. They âenlisted some powerful allies in the effort to defeat Donald Trump: grandparents.â And they arenât holding back: âThis is probably one of the most important elections, because there is so much is at stake.â Of course, their experiences with Germany take front and center: âWe have seen this before. We saw it in Germany, andÂ donât want to see it again.â Their hatred for Trump is not hidden, and for good reason: âTrump is more than a tyrant. Heâs an obnoxiousÂ lying individual and I havenât any respect for him. I have tremendous fears for the country and and for you, my grandchildren.â Adding some lighthearted (but important) humor, one grandparent tells their grandkids: âIf you vote the future is yours. If you donât vote for Hillary, and that crazy man Trump is elected, Iâll haunt you when I die.â Another promises to be a major spoiler: âIâll spoil every episode of âGame of Thrones. When youâre having a dinner party, Iâll come down and say something racist, but if youâre voting for Trump, you probably donât care.â The powerful video, sponsored by Bend the Arc Jewish Action, was released to warn future generations not to forget their history, and to listen to the wisdom of their elders, especially ones that know oppression when they see it: âWe, as Jews, recognize that [Trumpâs] candidacy has echoed times when the Jewish community experienced the dangers of fascism, anti-immigration and persecution against religious minorities.Â Weâve seen this beforeÂ and we wanted to make sure that as Jews we were speaking out boldly and loudly and making sure it was known the Jewish community rejects Trump for the platform of hatred and bigotry that he has unleashed.â Watch the powerful ad here:  ",0,1,0
456,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are virtually tied headed into their first presidential debate Monday night, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows. The survey shows likely voters split 46% for Clinton and 44% for Trump -- with 5% supporting Libertarian Gary Johnson and 1% backing the Green Party's Jill Stein. That's well within the poll's 4.5 percentage point margin of error. Among a broader group -- registered voters -- Clinton and Trump are tied at 41%, with Johnson at 7% and Stein at 2%. The results show the race has tightened in recent weeks. In the same poll, Clinton led by 5 points in early September and by 8 points in early August. A new CNN Poll of Polls incorporating the results of the new Post-ABC Poll finds the margin in an average of the five most recent polls holding at a three-point edge for Clinton, 43% back her, 40% Trump in that calculation. There's been a similar tightening in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, a new Allentown Morning Call/Muhlenberg College survey shows. That poll, released Sunday, has Clinton at 40% to Trump's 38%, with Johnson at 8% and Stein at 3%. That's a drop for Clinton, who led by 8 points in the same poll a week earlier. The ABC News/Washington Post poll also underscored that the 9 p.m. ET Monday debate at Hofstra University in New York will be a crucial moment in the campaign for both candidates. Eight in 10 voters said they plan to watch the debate -- with expectations slightly higher for Clinton, with 44% saying they expect her to win the debate while 34% expect Trump to win.

392,"(CNN)Congressional Black Caucus members demanded that the Justice Department ""aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions"" regarding the recent deaths of two black men, which stemmed from fatal police shootings. ""We come to you today to urge you to aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, reading excerpts from a letter members later presented to Attorney General Loretta Lynch decrying violence. ""We will not continue to ask our constituents to be patient without any hope for change,"" she added. ""Madame Attorney General, you have the unique opportunity and constitutional responsibility to change this narrative."" Caucus Chair G. K. Butterfield said the incidents this week are not isolated. ""The Congressional Black Caucus is outraged with the dozens of unlawful police shootings that are taking place all across America involving unarmed, innocent African-American citizens,"" Butterfield told reporters. ""If we were to identify each of these, it would consume this entire press conference,"" the North Carolina Democrat added. Multiple members of the group, which includes dozens of African-American members of Congress, have spoken out following the death of Terence Crutcher, who was shot and killed last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. ""He posed no threat. He had no weapon. And yet he was confronted by the Tulsa Police Department and he was both tasered and shot to death,"" said New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman in a video posted on the caucus' page. ""This is disgusting. And I am angry and I am hurt."" In a news conference Thursday, Lynch expressed sorrow about the ongoing conflicts between law enforcement and people of color. ""One of my top priorities as attorney general has been to do everything in my power to help heal those divides. And the Department of Justice will continue working tirelessly to protect the rights of all Americans,"" she said. ""We have come together with thoughts and prayers far too many times for victims of violence -- civilians and law enforcement alike,"" she added. Multiple police officers and citizens have been injured this week during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Police say Scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that the department would not be releasing a video of the encounter between Scott and law enforcement. Rep. Joyce Beatty told CNN's John Berman that lawmakers ""can't be silent."" ""I think transparency is of the utmost. I understand the legalities. I understand that you have to have a full investigation,"" she said on ""At This Hour."" ""We want to make sure that the US Department of Justice is engaged. We want to have independent investigators going into these communities so we take away all doubt or perceptions of the biases,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're losing too many lives."" Both presidential candidates have spoken out this week about the need to improve the relationship between black communities and law enforcement. Hillary Clinton, who the Black Caucus' political action committee endorsed, addressed the shootings in a speech Wednesday in Orlando, Florida. ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" And Donald Trump said Wednesday he was ""very troubled"" by the fatal police shooting in Tulsa and suggested the officer in question ""got scared"" or was ""choking,"" a slang term for failing under pressure.

We have seen many couples file for divorce over the past several months but this one might have shocked us more than any other. TMZ reported that Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pritt, and the reasoning will astound you.  Apparently Angelina filed for the divorce on Monday and cited irreconcilable differences. The reasoning for the divorce request was that she didn’t appreciate the way Brad interacted with his children. We don’t really know the details behind the story, but what we do know is she wants OUT. Not only that but after filing for the divorce, Angelina requested full physical custody of all of their children. She did request that Brad get visitation rights, but she does NOT want to have joint physical custody of the children – assuming it has something to do with the conflict behind the divorce.  Sources close to the couple shared with TMZ that Angelina was not happy with the way that Brad was parenting their children. Apparently she was really disappointed in the methods he was using to parent. Laura Wasser who is ripping Jolie stated that the separation date was September 15, 2016. She stated that Jolie is not asking for spousal support. The couple has been together for over 12 years and has been married for 2!

1102,"The “designated survivor” has long been one of Washington’s favorite parlor games—imagining what America would be like if a catastrophe befell the capital during a State of the Union and the most powerful office in the land were delivered unwittingly to the cabinet official who had been hidden away as the president-of-last-resort. What would America have looked like under President Jeh Johnson (2016)? President Ernest Moniz (2014)? Or even President Alberto Gonzales (2007)? And then there are the weirder examples: In 2001, had a catastrophe occurred during the inauguration, Americans expecting Republican President George W. Bush might have instead found themselves with a Democratic president named Larry Summers. The idea is startling enough to fuel a new Kiefer Sutherland TV drama, Designated Survivor, in which the 24 actor plays a hapless Housing and Urban Development Secretary who finds himself ushered into the White House after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol. Story Continued Below You might assume that for something as important as presidential succession, the world's most powerful nation has it down to a science. That’s the scenario that Hollywood lays out in the show premiere tonight: Sutherland, who just minutes before had been headed to political obscurity in a low-profile ambassadorship, is instead ushered into the White House by an efficient set of government minders. But in reality, the system is far less clearly delineated, and dogged by questions that are likely to begin the moment it’s pressed into action. I’ve spent the last three years researching a forthcoming book on the government’s doomsday plans, and one fact that emerged starkly is just how uncertain the whole process is. The system of presidential succession is relatively new, and in many cases it's surprisingly unclear who becomes president. As legal scholar Akhil Amar, who had long studied the legalities of succession, told Congress during one hearing after 9/11, “The current Presidential succession Act, 3 U.S.C. section 19, is in my view a disastrous statute, an accident waiting to happen. It should be repealed and replaced.” Indeed, the presidential succession plan is the rare Washington story that’s even stranger—and contains even more unexpected twists—than the Hollywood version. For one thing, the system, known as “continuity of government,” is vastly larger and more complicated than most people realize. While attention usually focuses on the main presidential successor, during high-profile events a much broader shadow government often waits in secure undisclosed locations. During President Obama’s inauguration in 2009, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates was the designated presidential successor, James Clapper—then the undersecretary of defense for intelligence—waited out the swearing-in at the Pentagon’s secret Cold War bunker in Pennsylvania known as Raven Rock, ready to step into Gates’ role as defense secretary if the need arose. But the even weirder thing is what might happen after a disaster. In fact, had Gates emerged from a cave to claim the presidency on January 20, 2009, it might’ve only marked the opening gambit in a legal drama that could have played out for days, weeks, or even months as a variety of officials from all three branches of government argued over who could rightfully claim the presidency. *** For about three hours the designated survivor teeters on the edge of becoming the most important person in the world. That moment in the spotlight—or, more accurately, far from the spotlight—can be brief. The night in 1997 Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman served as the “designated survivor” during one of President Clinton’s addresses to Congress, Glickman went to New York for the night, with a security detail and the nation’s nuclear codes in tow, only to find that as soon as the speech was finished—and the need for a successor over—the security apparatus abandoned him, leaving him in the rain to catch his own taxi home. The idea of a “designated survivor” was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations, as White House officials worried about nuclear missiles aboard Soviet submarines that lay off the Atlantic Coast and could have devastated the capital with barely 10 minutes’ notice. President Carter’s White House Military Office in April 1980 had instituted new procedures with FEMA to monitor the attendance of all presidential successors “at major, publicly announced functions outside the White House complex.” While such gatherings of the U.S. leadership had been commonplace in the past—at inaugurations, states of the union, state funerals and the like—the rising tensions of the Cold War made government planners questions their wisdom. “The situation provides an inviting target to enemy attack or terrorist activity, and represents an unnecessary risk to national leadership,” the White House Military Office wrote, outlining the new procedures. The 25th Amendment—itself a modern relic of the Cold War and fears of nuclear attack—lays out a seemingly clear line for presidential succession. It flows from the vice president to the House speaker to the Senate president pro tem, then through the cabinet in the order in which the departments were created—a quirk that itself makes the Department of Homeland Security secretary, one of the people best qualified to actually assume the presidency in a disaster, actually last in line. When all those in the line of succession were gathered in a high-profile setting, FEMA was to notify the White House and an aide would recommend to the president which qualified cabinet successors should skip the event. (Constitutionally, foreign-born cabinet secretaries, like current Interior Secretary Sally Jewell—a Brit!—don’t serve in the line of succession.) It falls to a little-known branch of FEMA, the Central Locator Service, to track the whereabouts of the successors daily, and once a month, after the fact, audit a single day to determine whether it had correctly known where each cabinet member was. The new White House and FEMA procedures got their first test at Reagan’s inaugural. The incoming and outgoing administrations had agreed that Carter’s outgoing defense secretary, Harold Brown, would remain in office past the standard noon departure and ensure that there was a national leader in case something catastrophic happened at the ceremony. “Both sides agreed that something should be done,” a FEMA official explained later. Brown only resigned later on inauguration day once the Reagan team was firmly in control of government’s levers. The “designated survivor” program would grow more formal in the years to come—the chosen Cabinet member would receive a Secret Service detail for the length of the event and a White House military aide would arrive for the evening with one of the emergency briefcases known as the “Football,” which contain instructions on how to access the nation’s nuclear weapons codes—in case the unthinkable happened and the designated survivor needed to be ready to launch an attack. The “designated survivor” program, though, raised a new problem: How would the “designated survivor” prove he or she was actually now the president? The government lacked simple procedures for figuring out how to double-check that person’s identity after a decapitation event. Is the person at the other end of the phone really Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (State of the Union 2012)? “One of the things we discovered is that there was no authentication system,” Reagan’s first FEMA head Louis Giuffrida said in 1981. “If a successor got on the horn and said, ‘I’m the successor,’ and somebody said ‘Prove it,’ [no one could]. So we’re working on that, and FEMA will be the authenticating mechanism to say, ‘Yeah, this guy’s for real. The president’s gone and we don’t know where the vice president is…and this is the man.’” In the years ahead, FEMA and the White House worked out an elaborate (and classified) system through which a successor would be able to confirm his or her identity, and in subsequent years the “designated survivors” became a common part of Washington lore, and often yielded amusing stories from those who served. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recounted the story of how she watched the 1996 State of the Union from the White House and ordered pizza. “I took my staff with me and I ordered pizza for them in the Roosevelt Room,” she said years later. “I went to the Oval Office and for one minute sat in the president's chair and then I got up respectfully and went to watch the speech with my staff.” Yet, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan commission examining the nation’s succession planning found that odd—and troubling—quirks persisted that could lead to serious constitutional quandaries in just the sort of situation that Kiefer Sutherland’s character, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman, experiences in the TV show. As clear as the line of succession may appear on paper, legally it would likely prove a much messier proposition the further down the list you go and cabinet officials become involved. And it could get particularly tangled if the president or vice president is only “incapacitated,” rather than killed outright. It’s not entirely clear, even, that the House speaker or the Senate president pro tem could legally serve as president. Republican Senator John Coryn raised the question during the debate in the early 2000s of what would happen if a speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem ascended to the presidency—and then was challenged by the secretary of state who argued that the legislators didn’t count as constitutional officers, making them ineligible to serve in the presidency. “Believe it or not, the secretary actually has a rather strong case, in my view,” Cornyn said. No less an authority than James Madison himself had argued that the congressional leaders were legislators, not constitutional officers, and thus ineligible to succeed to the presidency. As Cornyn said, “Who is the president? Whose orders should be followed by our armed forces, by our intelligence agencies and by domestic law enforcement bureaus? If law suits are filed, will courts accept jurisdiction? How long will they take to rule? How will they rule? And how will their rulings be respected?” In the years after 9/11, the so-called “Continuity of Government Commission,” pushed by American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm Ornstein, who has assumed the role of Washington’s succession Cassandra and has spent much of the last 20 years raising troubling questions about the 25th Amendment’s ambiguities, confronted one of the strangest and most nettlesome phrases in “COG” operations. It’s a seemingly unnecessary aside in the language guiding presidential succession known as the “supplantation clause,” which held that a “prior-entitled” presidential successor, that is someone who ranks higher in the official line of succession, could supplant a lower-level Cabinet official who was serving as “acting president.” For instance, in a situation where the president and the congressional leadership was killed, but the vice president only incapacitated, the secretary of state would presumably serve as “acting president” until the vice president was able to resume his or her responsibility and become the president. But the “supplantation clause” inserted unhelpful ambiguity: Could, after Congress reconstitutes itself, a newly elected speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem insist on replacing the secretary of state even after that person had assumed the office of “acting president”? Could a newly elected speaker supplant a president pro tem? Might the presidency swing wildly in a few days, at the height of a crisis, between different officials and different political parties? The Continuity of Government Commission tried also to tackle an ongoing problem with presidential succession that had dogged the debate for decades: Even with the idea of designated survivors for major high-profile gatherings and all the evacuation systems in place, on a day-to-day basis everyone in the presidential line of succession lives and works in a tiny radius extending a few miles around the White House and the Capitol. “In the nightmare scenario of terrorists detonating a nuclear device, it is possible that everyone in the line of succession might be killed,” the commission’s executive director, John Fortier, told Congress during one hearing. “Imagine the aftermath: a parade of generals, governors, and under secretaries claiming to be in charge.” It would be the chaos of Al Haig’s “I’m in control here” statement during the Reagan administration writ larger and more fraught. One proposal, floated during the post-9/11 discussions, would have created a “First Secretary,” a Cabinet official who would have been first-in-line to the presidency after the vice president and whose sole responsibility would be to remain outside of Washington and be the designated survivor to head the shadow government if a catastrophic event destroyed the capital. It would be a job, in essence, to remain in an “undisclosed location” until the worst moment of American history. * * * Such questions make the nation, under existing rules, particularly vulnerable during presidential inaugurations. The terms of the president and vice president constitutionally expire at noon on January 20th, but their cabinets remained in office until either a resignation is tendered or a successor is confirmed by the Senate—which usually doesn’t happen for hours or even days after an inauguration. In 2001, as Fortier, the commission leader explained, a terror attack that targeted George W. Bush’s inauguration, might have left the nation with a president carried over from the previous administration who would then serve until Congress had a speaker or president pro tem who would “bump” out the president and serve the rest of the four-year term of office. Fortier said, “A country expecting Republican George W. Bush to take office would have found themselves with a Democratic President Larry Summers. As secretary of the treasury, Summers was the highest-ranking Clinton Cabinet member eligible to serve as President.” In 1989, at George H.W. Bush’s inauguration, the situation would have been even more confusing, with the same strange outcome: Michael Armacost, the number three official at Reagan’s State Department, would have been elevated to president of the United States, for the outgoing secretary of state, George Shultz, and deputy secretary of state, John C. Whitehead, had both resigned before the inauguration. Then, with the House in Democratic hands, a newly chosen speaker could have bumped Armacost and given the nation four years of Democratic rule immediately after it elected a Republican president. In fact, given that the Senate took five days to confirm James Baker as secretary of state after Bush’s inauguration, Armacost remained fourth in line to the presidency for the better part of a week. Armacost went on to serve as president of the Brookings Institution and Summers went on to serve as president of Harvard University, so both men ended up with the title of “President,” but—had an unprecedented crisis summoned them to lead in 1989 or 2001—it’s hard to imagine that the ascension of either man to the American presidency would have proved reassuring to the nation in its moment of need. Unless Kiefer Sutherland’s drama reopens the debate, there are no plans to fix any of these—or a host of other—problems with presidential succession. Congress tabled and ignored the fixes on the table a decade ago, and except for a few lonely congressional voices in the years since, like Rep. Brian Baird, there’s been little attention since. So, as you tune in to watch Kiefer Sutherland heroically step in and lead the nation on TV, know that you’re perhaps watching the ultimate Hollywood fiction: The idea that the government’s Doomsday plans would actually work.",1,0,0
836,"Judge Jeanine Pirro has been all over Hillary Clinton and her lack of truthfulness ever since the infamous email scandal broke. We don’t blame her, Hillary’s lies have, in all likelihood, gotten people killed and put America at risk, not to mention the fact that she’s lied to Congress and the FBI and countless other government bodies. So, Pirro decided to take Clinton down on the eve of the first presidential debate, in the classiest way possible – by propping up Trump. Epic.  “Donald, it’s real simple.  You’re new at this.  If you are yourself, you will obliterate her like you did those 16 others on those Republican primary debate stages,” Pirro said of her longtime friend, Donald Trump. “Your opponent cannot handle the truth. She can’t handle a direct question. Nor is she able to give a direct response.  Do not let her do the Washington two-step.  Stay on offense.  Without being offensive.” Pirro also suggested Trump should ignore Clinton’s gender as a reason to be considerably kinder to her than he would if he were debating a man. “She wants to be the leader of the free world– gender is irrelevant. Make her prove she’s up to it both mentally, physically and historically.” She also advised he be more “presidential” than in prior debates, where nicknames like “Lyin’ Ted”and “Little Marco” were common expressions: “You’re a smart man Donald. This is the time to be presidential.  No smirks.  No faces.” Pirro suggested to Clinton that she too be herself—“Cold.  Calculating. Imperialistic.” “And Hillary, don’t shy away from talking about your record.  The state of the world in chaos with you in charge of foreign policy– unless of course you don’t want to,” she said.

63,"Betty Shelby, a white Tulsa police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black man, turned herself into the Tulsa County Jail early this morning, and is now out on bond. She is accused of fatally shooting 40-year-old Terence Crutcher last Friday night. Shelby was arrested at 1 a.m. CT today for first-degree manslaughter and she was released less than 30 minutes later on $50,000 bond.  Her first court date is scheduled for Sept. 30. ""Officer Shelby, although now charged, is presumed to be innocent under the law until a judge or jury determines otherwise,"" the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office said.  If she is found guilty, first-degree manslaughter carries a prison sentence of at least four years, according to the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office.  Shelby has not been fired from the force, the Tulsa Police Department told ABC News. Now that she’s been charged, the department said it will afford her full due process, and after the trial, the department will complete an internal affairs review and then a determination will be made regarding her employment. She is currently on unpaid leave but was originally put on paid administrative leave until the charge was filed.        After Shelby came across Crutcher's SUV in the middle of a two-lane roadway while it was still running, Crutcher ignored dozens of commands Shelby gave him, according to her attorney Scott Wood. She shot him as he allegedly tried to reach his arm into the open driver's side window. Crutcher's family attorneys maintain that the window was up, pointing to the blood spattered on it when he was shot. According to an affidavit by an investigator with the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office, Shelby reacted ""unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation"" with Crutcher. Shelby became ""emotionally involved"" to the point that she overreacted, the affidavit states, adding that she was ""not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present.""  On Tuesday, days before her arrest, Wood told ABC News that Shelby ""is very, very distraught about ... the fact that she has taken a human life. She said the other day in her interview with homicide detectives, 'I was never so scared in my life as in that moment right then.'""

1626,"Three of the Baltimore police officers previously charged in the death of Freddie Gray were recently treated like war heroes at a right-wing media gala. Deneen Borelli, a regular contributor to Fox News, gave a speech at the Media Research Center’s annual black tie gala lauding the officers Garrett Miller, Edward Nero, and Brian Rice in front of panelists like Rush Limbaugh, Monica Crowley, and Cal Thomas. 25-year-old Freddie Gray’s death — which was ruled as a homicide — was only mentioned once, as an afterthought. According to the New York Daily News, Borelli blamed the Baltimore riots not on the six officers charged in Freddie Gray’s death, but on “the left, political agitators, and the national media” who were out to “advance the anti-police narrative.” “These five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated,” Borelli said. ““No one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. Who will thank these officers? Who will thank all police officers…at a time they are being so vilified? Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will.” Officer Garett Miller, who remains under administrative duty pending an internal affairs investigation into Gray’s death, complained that the police officer profession was “hurting,” and asked for “prayers.” “We’re losing officers at an incredible rate. Not just from gunfire but because they’re tired of it. They quit. Our department is short. Everywhere is short. Nobody wants to be a police officer anymore,” Miller said. As the Baltimore Sun reported, Gray suffered a fatal injury to his spine after taking a blow to the lower-left side of his head while being transported in a Baltimore police van. Officers restrained Gray’s hands and ankles, and didn’t belt him in before transporting him, which is a violation of Baltimore Police Department policy. “The assisting officer opened the doors and observed Mr. Gray lying belly down on the floor with his head facing the cabin compartment, and reportedly he was asking for help, saying he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t get up, and needed a medic,” the autopsy report read. All six officers charged in Freddie Gray’s death were ultimately cleared of all charges earlier this year.          ",0,1,0
360,"(CNN)Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says he and Donald Trump missed a chance to meet this week due to scheduling problems -- a different version of events than put forward by a Democratic senator. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said Wednesday that Poroshenko sought a meeting with the GOP nominee during the United Nations General Assembly in New York but was ignored. ""Earlier this summer, I led a bipartisan delegation to Eastern Europe. We visited Ukraine in particular, and I know President Poroshenko of Ukraine was seeking a meeting with Donald Trump while he was in New York meeting with the president of Egypt, and was rejected,"" the Delaware Democrat told CNN ""New Day"" host Chris Cuomo. But Poroshenko says that's not how it happened. ""We don't have any refusal,"" the Ukrainian president said in an interview on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" chalking it up to a scheduling conflict during a crammed few days of meeting with 22 heads of state. Poroshenko said he didn't take the lack of a meeting with Trump as a snub, citing bipartisan support in for his country in Congress. Earlier Wednesday a Ukrainian official confirmed to CNN that Poroshenko's office requested a meeting with both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but only received a response from Clinton, who agreed to the meeting. A message left with Trump's campaign Wednesday was not immediately returned. Trump did meet Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, during which the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting. Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko took place just a few minutes before Trump met with el Sisi a short distance away. Before that meeting the Democratic nominee said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts."" Coons -- a vocal supporter of Clinton for president -- was quick to link Trump's decision not to meet with Poroshenko to positive comments Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country, a primary geopolitical antagonist to Ukraine. ""Donald Trump's statements about Ukraine and Putin suggest a dangerous lack of familiarity with Putin's actual record of invading a neighboring country and a dangerous lack of respect for or familiarity with our NATO treaty alliances,"" he said. Coons continued, ""In meetings I had with heads of state in recent days here in New York City, they all expressed real concern or questions about Donald Trump's readiness or fitness to serve as president."" Trump's rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia throughout the US presidential election has prompted criticism and scrutiny, even from members of his own party. The GOP nominee has praised Putin as ""a leader far more than our President has been a leader,"" and suggested that the United States shouldn't automatically come to the defense of NATO allies in Eastern Europe who are threatened by an increasingly aggressive Russia if those countries don't adequately fund their own militaries.

1139,"Mitch McConnell is playing hardball — forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month. With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board. Story Continued Below Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June. The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday — which funds the government until Dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option. “There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that’s what I’ve just offered,” McConnell said. “It’s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.” But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn’t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan. “To put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I haven’t counted votes but our caucus isn’t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan."" It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank’s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded. “The president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn’t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank. Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders."" ""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon. “We’re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,” Reid told reporters. “I’ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she’s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It’s really unfair to the American people.” During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, “in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.” Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a “Republican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed. ""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

301,"(CNN)Former President George H.W. Bush said Monday that he will vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to the 41st President -- an extraordinary rebuke of his own party's nominee. The sources said this was not the first time Bush had disclosed his intention to vote for Clinton. The comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation when Bush was speaking to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter and the former Maryland lieutenant governor. There were roughly 40 people in the room, and it's not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did. The Republican former president's embrace of the Democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in American politics. It's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday that she respects ""the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision."" ""It is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race,"" she added on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""But look, this was a bruising primary ... so I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there."" News of his support for Clinton came first on Facebook, when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with George H.W. Bush, along with the caption: ""The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!"" Kennedy Townsend sits on the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation. Bush family representatives declined to respond publicly. ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim,"" Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. But sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN they were surprised and disappointed that Kennedy Townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president. Kennedy Townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the Rock Creek Group, where she works as managing director. She later took down the Facebook post. GOP's Trump divide Trump's controversial candidacy has split the group of former Republican nominees. Mitt Romney has hammered Trump in speeches and on Twitter, calling him unfit for office. But former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole has endorsed Trump, as has Arizona Sen. John McCain -- though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to ""the Republican nominee"" rather than Trump by name. Neither George H.W. Bush nor George W. Bush had weighed in on the general election -- even as Trump savaged George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq. However, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents' Cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed Clinton. George H.W. Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton in June, saying she ""has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time."" George W. Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN in August that he ""would have preferred Jeb Bush, but I think Hillary is a great choice. I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country."" And Louis Wade Sullivan, the Health and Human Services secretary under George H.W. Bush and the only African-American in his Cabinet, said this month that ""though my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered, I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump."" But George H.W. Bush isn't speaking for his entire family. Marvin Bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. George P. Bush, George H.W. Bush's grandson, has backed Trump. And Jeb Bush, Trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for Trump or Clinton. A representative for George W. Bush wouldn't comment on Kennedy Townsend's Facebook post or how George H.W. Bush would vote. The representative simply said George W. Bush is ""spending his time working to keep the Senate in Republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign."" The Bush-Clinton relationship The evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families began in 1992, when Bill Clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent President George H.W. Bush. Eight years later, with Clinton term-limited out of office, Bush's son, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, succeeded Clinton on a pledge to ""restore honor and dignity"" to the White House -- a not-so-subtle knock on Clinton's marital infidelity. But Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. And in recent years, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have increasingly appeared together. The two grew so close that George W. Bush has referred to Clinton as his ""brother from another mother,"" and Clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers. A Bush-Clinton matchup Early in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- the 41st president's son and the 43rd president's brother -- was a Republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse. Even if George H.W. Bush hadn't endorsed Hillary Clinton, it was hard to envision him backing Trump. Neither of the former Bush presidents attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump became the GOP's nominee -- with the Bush family staying out of presidential politics after Jeb Bush, denounced repeatedly by Trump as ""low-energy,"" exited the race. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify the context in which George H.W. Bush made his comment about voting for Hillary Clinton. CNN's Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",1,0,0
257,"(CNN)Interviewed Monday on Fox News Channel's ""Fox and Friends,"" Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, declared that Americans have traveled overseas, fought for ISIS and returned with impunity.  ""We have people going over, fighting for ISIS and coming back, and we know they are fighting for ISIS, and we take them,"" he said. ""Once you leave this country, you fight for ISIS, you never come back.""  Is that really true that they come back and let loose? In a word - no.  New America, a Washington-based think tank, has used public records and news accounts to track Americans who have aided ISIS. According to its analysis, 117 people in the US have attempted to join ISIS or other terrorist groups in Syria, have made it there to fight, or have helped other join these organizations. According to New America's report, 74 of those were arrested before reaching Syria. Forty-three managed to reach that country and join the fight. Of those, 17 were killed and 8 were arrested when they returned home.  ""Any American who has traveled to fight with a designated foreign terrorist organization and returned here would be subject to prosecution,"" said Justice Department spokesman, Marc Ramondi.  One person, Moner Abusalha of Florida, did train with the al-Qaeda affiliated group, the al-Nusra Front, and did return undetected to the US. But rather than stage any attacks on US soil, Abusalha returned to Syria after unsuccessfully trying to recruit more fighters here. He was later killed.  There is no evidence for Trump's claim that US officials have allowed Americans who fought with terrorist groups in Syria to escape punishment when they returned home.  ",1,0,0

Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist? Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books. She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house. Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough. ‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes. When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’. She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan. Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.  In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

1330,"Hillary Clinton’s decision to stand by her husband and attack former White House intern Monica Lewinsky when news of a sexual relationship between the two broke in 1998 prove that the former secretary of state is “too stupid to be president,” Rudy Giuliani said Monday night. The former New York City mayor made the remark, captured on video and posted to Twitter by Elite Daily writer Alexandra Svokos, in response to a question about Clinton’s attack on Trump’s past comments about women. Giuliani defended Trump, labeling him a “feminist” because of how he treats the women he employs, and said he would have responded to Clinton’s attacks much more harshly than the GOP nominee did. Story Continued Below “I sure would’ve talked about what she did to Monica Lewinsky, what that woman standing there did to Monica Lewinsky, trying to paint her as an insane young woman when in fact Monica Lewinsky was an intern,” Giuliani said. “The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didn’t just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky. And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn’t know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you’re too stupid to be president.” Trump himself said Monday night and again Tuesday morning that he had considered raising the former president’s history of marital infidelities as a response to the former secretary of state’s attacks. He opted against it, he said, because the couple’s daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was in attendance and he though such an attack would be in poor taste. The Manhattan billionaire did not rule out leveling such an attack at future debates. “Well, I may hit her harder certain ways,” he told Fox News Tuesday morning. “I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. So, I may hit her harder in certain ways.”",1,0,0
738,"Conservative talk show host, author, and founder of The Blaze, Glenn Beck, a fervent supporter of Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, put the Texas senator in the hot seat on Monday, grilling him over his shocking endorsement of Donald Trump announced on Friday. Beck, who is still firmly in the “Never Trump” camp, grilled Cruz from the beginning in an interview that no one will call “softball.” He started out by asking Cruz, who was calm and serious during the entire interview, how he could go from “vote your conscience” to now not only announcing that he’s voting for Donald Trump, but encouraging others to as well. “So am I now suppose to vote for him, or am I supposed to vote my conscience?” Beck asked, already showing a tone in his voice that expressed some disdain. “Well, Glenn, what I said in Cleveland and what I would say today is the same thing. You should follow your conscience. And I believe what I laid out in Cleveland was don’t stay home and vote your conscience and vote for candidates you trust to defend the Constitution. And what I was trying to do in Cleveland was lay out a path to uniting Republicans and lay out a path to winning. And in particular, I was saying to the Trump campaign — ‘This is how you earn my vote and I believe how you earn the vote of other conservatives — you defend freedom and defend the Constitution.’ This is about principles and ideas.”  When Ted Cruz began to explain how Hillary Clinton is certainly not the person to defend the Constitution, Glenn Beck interrupted, pointing out that we’ve known that “for 25 years,” and noted that when Cruz was asked over the weekend whether Donald Trump is fit to be president, he avoided directly answering the question. “What I said is this is a binary choice — I wish it were not a binary choice,” Cruz responded. “You know, I tried very, very hard, as did you, to prevent it from being a binary choice between Hillary and Donald Trump and I think it is fair to say there was no other Republican candidate who left more on the field and did more to stop Donald from being the nominee than I did. But the voters made a different decision and you have to respect the democratic process even if you may not be terribly happy with the outcome…” “So a man — I just want to make sure I understand — so a man who has principles who says, ‘There are lines I will not cross,’ it’s still a binary choice — so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be President of the United States,’ I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” Beck asked, interrupting Cruz again. “You are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable and principled,” Cruz answered. “And from my perspective, as I look at the issues, Hillary Clinton is telling us she will do enormous damage to the country,” Cruz explained, bringing up issues like filling Supreme Court vacancies while stating that “every one of our constitutional rights hangs in the balance.” Glenn Beck said that Ted Cruz knew these things in July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and had previously accused Donald Trump of being a “sociopathic liar” during the campaign and wondered how voters are now supposed to believe Trump when he takes positions on issues. “First of all, I have had many significant disagreements with Donald Trump, but as you noted I have not been shy to articulate those at considerable length. I don’t intend to do so at this point — the primary is over. We are in a general election with a binary choice and I don’t think it’s beneficial for me laying out those concerns,” Cruz answered. Again, Beck pressed, asking Cruz what changed between the convention and now to make Cruz change his mind when he could have done so at the convention. Ted Cruz explained that what changed for him was on Friday, the same day Cruz made his endorsement announcement, the Trump campaign guaranteed him that they would indeed pick from the list of potential Supreme Court nominees and also added Utah Senator Mike Lee , a principled constitutionalist, to the top of the list. “That was not an accident that that occurred,” Cruz told Beck. “When several weeks ago — when I sat down with Mike Pence in Washington — Mike asked me, ‘What would it take to get you on board?’ And for months, I had been telling Donald — I’ve been telling the campaign my greatest concern was protecting the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the rule of law. I told Donald that before the convention, I said that over and over and over again. And when we talked about, ‘Well, what could the campaign do to give any degree of reassurance on the Constitution and the rule of law, we discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law. And the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped get me to the point of saying ‘yes.” Co-host Stu Burguiere then asked Cruz how he could possibly believe Trump’s word on the Supreme Court or anything else considering his well-documented history of being flimsy with the truth. Cruz answered by referring to his endorsement announcement on Facebook and explained that it was a decision that he “agonized about,” but that he knew with “one-hundred percent certainty” that Hillary Clinton would appoint “left-wing ideologues” to the Supreme Court and that the free speech, the right to bear arms and U.S. sovereignty would likely be eliminated. Cruz said that “he hoped” Trump would follow through on his commitment since he’s publicly promised to, but there is no way of knowing with certainty if anyone will keep their word. “The fact that he is publicly promising he will nominate from these 21, I think creates a dynamic where compared to Hillary who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice,” Cruz contended. Ted Cruz then explained that his much-ballyhooed speech in Cleveland was unfortunately perceived to mean he was “Never Trump,” but Cruz said that was not actually the case. He revealed that his speech drew upon convention speeches given previously by Ted Kennedy and Ronald Reagan during their primary challenges — speeches that were largely considered endorsements of their respective party’s eventual winner. After some contentious back-and-forth between Beck and his co-hosts, Cruz said that his goal of his convention speech was to move Trump closer to defending the Constitution and focus on the issues that matter to conservatives and that confirming that he would definitely pick from the Supreme Court list was pivotal as was Trump’s statement last week that he supported Cruz’s efforts to stop Obama’s Internet giveaway. “I was articulating, ‘If you want my vote, defend freedom and defend the Constitution,” Cruz said. “When Donald Trump comes in and supports our efforts to defend freedom, that’s significant. Does it mean that he will always do so in the future? No, I don’t have certainty of any candidate on that but what I do know is that what Hillary is promising to do would do enormous damage — the court would be lost for a generation. And the question of voting your conscience…listen, that is what I have struggled four months prayerfully considering what is the right thing to do.” Cruz went on to say that voters had five choices in regards to the presidential election, including voting third-party and not voting period, but that he could not publicly defend those choices because he was always “Never Hillary,” and the only path he sees to stop her presidency is to vote for Donald Trump. Glenn Beck, visibly angry, then skipped the commercial break, a break he said would cost him $20,000, but was well worth it to get in one more question with Cruz, which was to ask whether Cruz was selling an email list provided to him by Glenn Beck, to Donald Trump. Cruz answered that in the same way that Beck’s radio program sells advertising, Cruz — as does every other political campaign — rents their email lists to fund their efforts. He did not say specifically whether any such arrangement had been made with the Trump campaign but noted that there is a “hit piece” today by Politico, which he called a “left-wing rag,” that is applying a standard to him that they are not applying to any other politician. Beck concluded the interview by telling Cruz that he strongly disagreed with him on the issue of Trump but still respects him as a man. However, after the break, a disgruntled Beck suggested that perhaps he shouldn’t have supported the most principled conservative in the primary, but maybe should have supported Marco Rubio instead based upon him being able to defeat Hillary Clinton and forgiving his prior stance on illegal immigration and amnesty. “For the very first time I heard Ted Cruz calculate,” Beck said after the commercial break. “And when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me,” he continued. “And it’s my fault. It’s my fault for believing that men can actually be George Washington.” WATCH full interview below via The Glenn Beck Program:     Email Subscribe",0,0,1
1453,"Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin recently separated from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after a photo surfaced of Weiner sexting some random chick with their son right next to him. The Bunny Ranch legal brothel responded by offering Weiner a full time position as the director of social media, and we all laughed. But this? This is no laughing matter. It’s sick. According to that sourcelink, Weiner carried out a months-long online sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl. She claims he asked her to dress up in “school-girl” outfits and allegedly “pressed her to engage in ‘rape fantasies.'” The girl, whose name is being withheld by DailyMail.com because she is a minor, said the online relationship began last January while she was a high school sophomore and before Weiner’s wife, Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin, announced she was ended their marriage.   Weiner was aware that the girl was underage, according to DailyMail.com interviews with the girl and her father, as well as a cache of online messages. He knew this and sent her completely disgusting, inappropriate messages anyway. He sent her “bare-chested” photos of himself, called her “baby,” complimented her body and even told her he woke up “hard” thinking about her.  In one particularly lewd message, he told the teen: ‘I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.’ The teen said she originally reached out to Weiner on Twitter in January. She said she was interested in politics and heard about his sexting scandals and wanted to know more about him. It was clear from the messages that she was encouraging Weiner to engage with her in a sexual manner. She told DailyMail.com she didn’t consider Weiner her boyfriend, but thought the relationship was a ‘romantic’ one.  She acknowledged during interviews that she had developed an obsession with Weiner, and sought him out on Twitter in January while trying to write a book about him. She said she continued to write the book as their relationship developed.  ‘Why did I message you [in January]?’ the girl wrote in an email to Weiner last week. ‘I was studying you- for a book of course. You were my Hannibal Lecter.  ‘I wanted to know what made you tick. As we chatted, I pretended to not know EVERYTHING about you. I didn’t want to appear suspicious.’  She also told Weiner: ‘I was obsessed with you.’  Weiner quickly messaged her back, and they struck up a conversation about the large snowstorms that had hit New York and the girl’s home state. From there, he sent her a friend request on Facebook, and the rest is history. The girl told DailyMail.com that she and Weiner first started talking on Skype a few days into the relationship. ‘[Weiner’s] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,’ she said. ‘So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.’  Afterward, Weiner sent her a message with a heart-eyed emoji, writing ‘I caught a glimpse of your body’ and indicating he would like to keep talking over Skype.  She claimed the conversations grew more explicit as time went on, with Weiner allegedly asking her to undress and encouraging her to masturbate over video chat.  She said Weiner would not get fully nude, but was usually shirtless and wearing boxers.  ‘He would tell me to say his name as I was touching myself,’ said the girl. ‘He would ask me to take my clothes off.  ‘He would just have his shirt off. Sometimes he would grab his lower region, but that was about it,’ she added. Weiner didn’t deny messaging the teen and refused to address the specific allegations. “I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,” Weiner said. ” I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.” Weiner just got 195 times more disgusting. I know. I didn’t think it was possible either. If only his first name was Bill and his last name was Clinton. Then everyone would laugh about these sexual escapades. h/t Daily Mail",0,0,1
1432,"A new crime show has revealed a shocking twist in the case of JonBenet Ramsey's murder. On Sept. 19, ""The Case Of: JonBenet Ramsey"" aired on CBS, revealing a surprising suspect in the murder -- her brother, Burke Ramsey. In 1996, JonBenet, a child beauty queen, was found beaten and strangled to death in her family's cellar, just hours after her mother, Patsy, called 911 to report that she had been kidnapped. To this day, no charges have been filed in the case and there has been much speculation about who may be responsible. In the new two-part CBS documentary, a team of experts reviews the evidence in the case and, in the final minutes of the special, reveal that they have reason to believe Burke, who was 9 at the time, may be the suspect. The experts believe, however, that JonBenet's death could have been accidental.  It was revealed in the documentary that Burke struck his younger sister with a golf club a year before her death after ""losing his temper,"" according to the Daily Mail. James Kolar, former chief of investigation for the District Attorney in Boulder, presented the theory that Burke may be responsible for JonBenet's death. He noted that Patsy had left a bowl of pineapple and some tea for Burke and that when Burke caught JonBenet trying to sneak some of the fruit later on, he lashed out and struck her with a flashlight, killing her. ""My hypothesis was that I think the Ramseys came home around 9:30, 10 o'clock,"" Kolar said. ""I think JonBenet was asleep. I think John did carry her upstairs, Patsy remained downstairs with Burke and served him the tea and the pineapple. I think that accounts for the physical evidence as well as the latent print. Then she got JonBenet up to make sure she used the toilet, so she didn't wet the bed that night."" Kolar added, ""JonBenet was up, she may or may not have brushed her teeth, that stuff was out on the counter, then I think she was up and awake enough that she was maybe still hungry and she went downstairs."" ""In the meantime, Patsy continued packing for the Michigan trip,"" he continued. ""I think if Burke was upset about circumstances or Christmas presents, he probably would have been upset about her trying to snag a piece of pineapple -- out of anger he may have struck her with that flashlight."" Investigators believe that there was likely no intent to kill on Burke's part, but that the Ramsey family had intended to mislead the investigation. ""The Ramsey family did not want law enforcement to resolve this case and that's why it remains unresolved,"" former FBI profiler Jim Clemente said. Investigators added that they do not believe Burke was involved in the cover-up, but that both parents likely were, based on the conflicting motives in the ransom letter. It was also concluded that DNA on JonBenet's underwear did not match any family member and did not prove that any sexual assault had taken place, notes Us Weekly.

1129,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich praised Donald Trump's outreach to inner cities in an appearance on Fox News on Thursday morning. ""The core problem is that people are trapped in the neighborhoods with no hope, no future, no jobs. There have been over 3,000 people shot in Chicago so far this year. One every two hours,"" Gingrich said, adding, ""one thing I'll say about Trump, he's the first conservative I've seen willing to go into the inner city and talk about the need for dramatic change."" Story Continued Below Gingrich, a Trump supporter, criticized Democratic leadership in inner cities, and suggested Barack Obama could have done more as president to diffuse racial tensions in the country. When asked how Obama may have missed an opportunity to repair race relations, he said, ""I think the biggest aspect was that all of the major inner cities, all of them governed by Democrats, are all disasters,"" citing statistics reflecting low primary school passing rates in several cities. ""More Americans have been killed while Obama was president, in Chicago, than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. And I think the president had a unique opportunity, but my guess is he was afraid it would make him a black president in a narrowing sense,"" he said.",1,0,0
74,"Cities across the country suffered an uptick in violent crime last year, including a nearly 11 percent jump in murders from the year before, according to new statistics compiled by the FBI. There were 1,197,704 violent crimes committed around the nation last year -- a 3.9 percent increase from 2014, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. However, last year's statistics were still slightly lower than in 2011, and more than 16 percent below the 2006 level, the FBI said today. It's important to note that big jumps in violent crime in only a handful of U.S. cities can drive the national average up. Some cities, like Chicago and Los Angeles, saw more than 24,000 violent crimes each last year, while so many other cities and towns across the country experienced single-digit or no violent crimes at all. Overall, murders accounted for nearly 15,700 of last year's violent crimes, and nearly three-quarters of them were committed with firearms, according to the FBI report.     ""The report shows that there was an overall increase in violent crime last year, making clear what each of us already knows: that we still have so much work to do,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a violent-reduction summit in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""But the report also reminds us of the progress that we are making. It shows that in many communities, crime has remained stable or even decreased from the historic lows reported in 2014. And it is important to remember that while crime did increase overall last year, 2015 still represented the third-lowest year for violent crime in the past two decades."" Lynch said the nation must not become ""complacent"" about violent crime. ""The residents of communities where violence remains a fact of daily life care little whether overall crime rates are up and down,"" she said. ""And in the raft of data and analysis that can so often define our work, we must never forget that all of our numbers reflect the lives of real people."" She emphasized that ""there is no single cause of violence, and solutions will vary from one community to another.""",1,0,0

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Mondayâs debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think itâs perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow. Biden said: âThis is a guy who said â and wants to be president â that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?â Adding: âEvery president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what weâre supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.â Then really getting to the core of it, he said: âHe does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they donât take pleasure from âYouâre fired.â They donât take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.â Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and donât have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. âHe acknowledged that he didnât pay taxes because, he said, heâs smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here whoâs paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.â Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates: âIf this choice isnât clear, I donât know â- my lordâ¦ What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.â And itâs true, the choice is abundantly clear â Hillary Rodham Clinton should and be our next president.

Forty-year-old Terence Crutcher was fatally shot by a white police officer after his SUV stalled on the road. Video of the incident released after the shooting appears to show Crutcher with his hands raised in the air.     Calling the act “unbearable” and saying officer-involved shootings “need to be intolerable,” Clinton appealed to a white audience to address unconscious discrimination. ""Maybe I can, by speaking directly to white people, say look, this is not who we are. We have got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias,"" she said.  Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H  Clinton’s policy proposal for criminal justice reform includes developing national standards on police officers’ use of force, supporting legislation to end racial profiling, and committing $1 billion in funding to training programs and research to “tackle” implicit bias.

1233,"H.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician — “down.” Likewise, there’s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump — an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity. Story Continued Below Yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She’s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she’s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is — or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don’t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever’s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she’s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible. But the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She’s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples. Everyone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box — running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He’s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn’t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn’t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can’t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing. These are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump’s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday — but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States? 1. Does he actually know — or care to know — the basic information needed to competently run the country? Only one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that’s a candidate’s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump — who swooned after Clinton’s superb convention in Philly — has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He’s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing. His resurgence proves three political points — two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and — lastly, but not leastly — Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to. The first debate should be a pivot — from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn’t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule — and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won’t happen, but a boy can dream. This is not to suggest that Trump can’t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he’s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence. Trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs — apparently he wasn’t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates — but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump’s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn’t aware of that fact, or just didn’t care. The caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. “All you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,” said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. “When you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.” Stone argued that Trump isn’t an ignoramus — just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush’s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush’s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis. Trump’s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless — but there’s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job. Many Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD’s Section 8 program is — and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don’t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms — by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate? 2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government? Again, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: “We're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace … we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.” That’s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: “For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with ‘actual malice’ — that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” During a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for “Article 12 of the Constitution.” The framers stopped at seven. “He was just listing out numbers,” said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. “I think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.” OK, let’s write that one off as a gotcha — you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where “some bad things are happening.” The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the “Free Exercise” clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds. 3. Why won’t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts? Hillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism. But the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one. Why does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump’s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he’s “very, very rich.” He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he’s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he’s worth less than half that much). More serious is the issue of Trump’s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that’s a lie, there’s an easy way to prove it — by releasing the returns. This isn’t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast. 4. What’s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there’s the matter of Trump’s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In exposé after exposé, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump’s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal. The problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others. 5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system. But if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he’s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts. Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary” in Trump’s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint — far from it — and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators. But it’s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness — especially George W. Bush’s claims about Iraq — would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump’s whoppers would take up too much space – read POLITICO’s comprehensive “Donald Trump’s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths” for a taste.) In an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump’s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. “Clinton,” the former speaker wrote, “is a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing…” But getting the facts right — and telling the truth — is a big thing. It’s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.",1,0,0

382,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's supporters on Capitol Hill said Thursday they know the stakes are high for Monday night's debate and could set the tone for the sprint to Election Day. ""Donald Trump knows, the team knows that Monday night is going to be not necessarily make or break, but the momentum coming out of Monday night could be critical on both sides and Donald Trump knows that,"" said Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican, as he walked out of what could be the final meeting of Trump's congressional supporters. ""He's likely to bring up some Clinton issues. I think we're going to see some give and take there,"" Collins said. ""We all know Mr. Trump is a little quicker on his feet than Mrs. Clinton."" The group met for close to an hour at the Republican National Committee headquarters and discussed the Trump campaign's plan for battleground states as well, but the debate prep stood out in the meeting led by top Trump advisers. Collins, the first congressman to endorse Trump and an early leader of efforts to rally highly reluctant House Republicans to Trump's side, said that he will be flying to New York Monday to help the Trump campaign after the debate against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the media spin room. ""Donald Trump knows that Monday night is absolutely critical,"" he said. ""And I think with that in the back of his mind, I'm confident we'll see presidential Trump Monday night."" Clinton supporters offer advice ahead of first debate Shortly after Collins talked Thursday, the Trump campaign sent out a debate prep survey to supporters, asking them what issues he should focus, whether he should attack Clinton's policies or defend his own and more. ""Do you think Trump should refer to Hillary as 'Crooked Hillary' on stage?"" Trump asked, in question #4 of the 30-question survey. Questions about Trump's use of charitable donations to pay off personal legal debts have hounded him this week, but Collins dismissed them and tried to put the focus back on the Clinton Foundation, which has been a source of consternation across the aisle. ""I'm sure there will be these kinds of volleys, we'll hear more about, but the fact of the matter is Trump's Foundation made donations to not-for-profit, 501(c)3s -- that's what foundations do. And I think the more important question, or issue is there's no Trump family members being paid by the foundation,"" Collins said. ""It's not a patronage pit like the Clinton Foundation is."" How to watch the first presidential debate Collins said Trump's Hill supporters also got an update on the battleground plans, with just six weeks left in the race, and said they are confident Trump has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win. ""There are six different ways for him to get to 269, he's right now leading in Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire, that takes him to 269, he might win one in Maine, there's 270, he might lose one in Nebraska, he's back to 269,"" he said. Collins cited other states in play -- Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia -- that could tip the balance to Trump. The focus now, he said, has turned from rallying conservatives to winning over independent and undecided voters. ""It's all about the undecideds, they don't like Hillary Clinton, they don't like her with her character flaws, they haven't warmed up to President Trump and that's where the debate is going to be so critical Monday night for President Trump to address the nation for all those people who want no part of Hillary Clinton.""

400,"Boise, Idaho (CNN)Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was ""trying to point out things that have to be said."" ""People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,"" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. ""For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for."" The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane. But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet. Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy."" Trump said he didn't ""want to be a distraction"" to the campaign, but that the negative response was being driven by partisan attacks. ""I understand that running as conservative, there is a different standard,"" he said. ""If a metaphor offends someone then maybe that's the world in which we live today, but I'm not comparing someone to candy,"" Trump said. ""It's a statistical thing. We have to be careful about who we let into this country."" But the statistics don't actually back up the contention made in the tweet. According to a recent Cato Institute report, the odds ""that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year."" Still, Trump said Thursday that it was his broader point was what mattered and that it was part of a discussion that needed to be had and one that tracked closely with the key components of his father's campaign strategy. ""He's created some good dialogue that needed to be had that wasn't being had because PC culture sort of forced real issues off of the table,"" Trump said of his father's campaign. ""The way he's been able to approach that and do that has forced people to actually have a dialogue and that's what this country is about, having that dialogue."" That dialogue -- about race, about refugees and about immigrants -- has been harshly criticized by Clinton and Trump detractors as racist, but Trump countered that it has been the driving force behind Trump's success. ""We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,"" Trump said. ""That's not what built this country, that's not what made this country great and that's why my father is resonating so well with working class, hard-working Americans.

Clinton, for her part, said Trump misunderstood the state of America’s inner cities. “Well, I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country,” she said. “The vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.” Trump has struggled badly amongst African-American voters, but has sought to close the gap in recent weeks with events in African-American churches.",1,0,0
1168,"The Obama administration on Thursday terminated the federal recognition of the nation's largest accreditor of for-profit colleges — a rare move that could ultimately jeopardize the ability of hundreds of schools to access federal funding. The decision against the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools amounts to what is effectively a death penalty. The sanction had been sought by prominent critics of for-profit colleges like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who on Thursday called the accreditor a ""negligent"" organization that had ""rubber-stamped shady institutions"" for years. Story Continued Below The accreditor's seal of approval had allowed billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded Pell Grants and federal loans to flow to the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges chain of schools, which shut down last year amid allegations that it lured in prospective students using false, inflated job placement rates. ACICS was also the accreditor for ITT Tech, another troubled for-profit college that declared bankruptcy last week. The accreditor says that about 600,000 students across the country are enrolled at colleges that it approves. ACICS officials on Thursday pledged to appeal the decision directly to Education Secretary John B. King Jr. — a move that would temporarily put the termination on hold. There’s no timeline for when King must act on that appeal, but earlier this week he pledged to get it “resolved quickly.” Roger Williams, the interim president of ACICS, said in a statement that the group was “disappointed” in the decision but “confident” it could show “ongoing progress” toward coming into compliance with federal rules. If the Education Department stands by its decision, ACICS-accredited colleges would have 18 months to find a new accreditor, or else their students would lose access to federal money. Congress earlier this week passed legislation that allows GI Bill educational benefits to continue to flow to student veterans for up to 18 months after their school’s accreditor loses its federal recognition. Like other college accreditors, ACICS acts as a gatekeeper for federal money: Last year, it allowed 243 colleges to tap into $4.76 billion worth of Pell Grants and federal student loans. The Obama administration's termination decision was based upon earlier Education Department findings that ACICS failed to properly monitor and discipline the colleges it oversees. “ACICS’s track record does not inspire confidence that it can address all of the problems effectively,” wrote Emma Vadehra, King's chief of staff, who issued the ruling. “Many of the problems identified in the staff report are serious and long-standing.” ACICS has been a prime target of for-profit critics and some Senate Democrats in recent years. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), on Thursday praised the administration’s decision in a statement, saying that “far too many schools have maintained their institutional accreditation, even while defrauding and misleading students.” But Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) blasted the Education Department’s decision as “an unprecedented action that could disrupt the education of hundreds of thousands of students, particularly low-income and minority students.” The for-profit industry's trade association argued that the department’s decision is yet another example of the unfair targeting of their industry by the Obama administration. ""The U.S. Department of Education's decision today will have horrible ramifications for hundreds of thousands of students, thousands of dedicated faculty and staff, and hundreds of communities and employers that rely on institutions accredited by ACICS,” said Steve Gunderson, who leads the Career Education Colleges and Universities trade group. ""No Administration has politicized accreditation like the current one.” Ben Miller, senior director of Postsecondary Education at the Center for American Progress, authored a report criticizing the record of ACICS that was frequently cited by a federal panel in making its recommendation to nix the accreditor. Miller praised Thursday's decision, calling it a ""landmark step for protecting students and taxpayers."" Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, said schools without any red flags can probably find a new accreditor in one year to 18 months, but it could take two years or much longer for other schools to find a new home. “It’s a major step,” Hartle said. “The department has done it at least once before, but never with an accreditation agency of this size.” Kimberly Hefling contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1072,"I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps. This year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. Story Continued Below So profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision. Here it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today’s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action. Nor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at “regime change.” She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as “another Hitler.” She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself. In fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America’s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking. That candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election. It must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin’s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did—an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin “killing Russians,” a doubly illegal act of war. Moreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war. *** John Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, “Above all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.” Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war. But within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our “strategy of peace,” he said, was “not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.” Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that “our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.” As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, “we must reexamine our own attitude—as individuals and as a nation—for our attitude is as essential as theirs.” Six months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world. “Our brave young men,” he said, “are dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.” He also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. “All this is our responsibility,” he said, “not just a nation’s responsibility but yours and mine.” John and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death. The legacy of JFK & RFK is “being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party.” Theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today’s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder. Scores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America’s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations. Most amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself—as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat. Where are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime “existential” threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be “existential” enemy. There are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today. Former Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, “on the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.” Surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade. But, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day. For the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives. And they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger. *** So my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again. We must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China. President Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children’s future. Second, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted. But nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land. Donald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, “America first.” But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond. Finally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, “There can be no business as usual with Russia.” Surely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time. And therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King: Return to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests. Do not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization. Commit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations. This, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties. Well may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both. Flawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations. Truly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.",1,0,0

1400,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games. Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.   Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.  Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.  ""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN. While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season. During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!"" Nonetheless, Rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement. ""As of now I plan to keep kneeling,"" she told ESPN.

934,"Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States. The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:  Data is from Trendsmap.com That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences. Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.” So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.   ",0,1,0
523,"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama on Tuesday tapped the highest-ranking US diplomat in Cuba as the first ambassador to the island in more than 50 years. But deep opposition among some senators means it's nearly impossible he'll be confirmed before the President leaves office. Jeffrey DeLaurentis has served as the United States' charge d'affairs in Havana since 2014, overseeing the reopening of the US Embassy there and helping shepherd in a new era of US-Cuba ties. Obama wrote in a statement that elevating DeLaurentis' title to ""ambassador"" was a ""common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries."" ""There is no public servant better suited to improve our ability to engage the Cuban people and advance US interests in Cuba than Jeff,"" Obama wrote. DeLaurentis was long expected to be named to the ambassador post, but critics of Obama's Cuba policy have remained steadfast in their opposition to any nomination. Cuban-American Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have been among the most vocal critics, saying the Castro regime is still violating basic human rights. In a statement Tuesday, Rubio wrote that ""rewarding the Castro government with a US ambassador is another last-ditch legacy project for the President that needs to be stopped."" ""This nomination should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people, and until longstanding concerns about the Cuban regime's theft of property and crimes against American citizens are addressed,"" Rubio wrote. Confirming DeLaurentis is yet another entry on a White House to-do list for Congress that seems destined to go unfulfilled, at least before November's elections. Among the other items: confirming Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Cuba in a half-century earlier this year. The last US ambassador to serve in Havana left the post in 1960 at the beginning of Fidel Castro's rule. The President has insisted that 50 years of enmity with Cuba hadn't yielded results for either Americans or Cubans, and maintains that a new approach will better serve both populations. ""We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador,"" he wrote in his statement Tuesday. ""If confirmed by the Senate, I know Jeff will build on the changes he helped bring about to better support the Cuban people and advance America's interests."" ",1,0,0
314,"Washington (CNN)The National Rifle Association is returning to the defense of Donald Trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, a reminder of how fervently the gun-rights group has backed the Republican nominee on television. The NRA is launching a $5 million TV ad campaign Tuesday, the group says, meant to turn out pro-Second Amendment voters at a time when Trump is being attacked for his language about firearms. The gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on Trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-Trump advertiser in the general election. But it had not been on the airwaves since late last month. The NRA's Political Victory Fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- while its Institute for Legislative Action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. All of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the NRA says would happen if Hillary Clinton appoints her chosen justices to the Supreme Court. ""She'll call 9-1-1. Average response time? 11 minutes,"" says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. The woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. ""Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone."" The advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be Democrats or disillusioned Republicans, according to Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman. ""It is designed to run up the score with those Trump voters,"" she said. The NRA's chief political adviser Chris Cox said the ad ""underscores"" how Clinton's position on guns creates ""one set of rules for her, and a different set of rules for the rest of us."" Trump has emerged as a proud spokesman for gun rights, though he has at times invited controversy. On multiple occasions, Trump has been attacked for encouraging gun-owners to incite violence against Clinton, though Trump's campaign has said he is being misinterpreted. ""I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,"" Trump said in Miami last week. ""Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her."" ",1,0,0

If the moderators are unfair to him, he’s going to come out and challenge them. There won’t be political niceties here. He’s a scrapper. I may not support the man, but trust me, I think he will mop the stage with these limp Marxists. That’s his brand. Hillary may think she has it in the bag and that the moderators will protect her and correct Trump at every turn, but not so fast. Trump has an unsettling effect on people. He’s known for throwing them off balance. And he loves the limelight… you don’t think for a moment that he will let someone like Clinton upstage him, do you? Don’t be silly.  From Rasmussen Reports: Voters are pretty convinced the moderators at the presidential debates scheduled to begin tonight will be helping Hillary Clinton more than Donald Trump. A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that a plurality (46%) of Likely U.S. Voters believes most moderators will try to help Clinton in the upcoming debates. Only six percent (6%) think they will try to help Trump instead. Just 32% say most of the moderators will try to be unbiased, while 15% are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) Seventy-eight percent (78%) of voters who support Trump think the moderators will try to help Clinton. Most Clinton supporters (56%) say the moderators will try to be unbiased, but 20% say they’ll try to help their candidate. Twelve percent (12%) of Clinton voters think the moderators will try to help Trump, compared to just two percent (2%) of Trump supporters who feel that way. Four years ago before the first debate between President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, 71% of Republicans and 56% of unaffiliated voters said debate moderators are biased, but Democrats by a 47% to 30% margin felt they were not biased. In 2008 before the first debate, 22% felt the first moderator, veteran PBS newsman Jim Lehrer, would try to help Obama, while six percent (6%) expected him to help GOP nominee John McCain. Forty-three percent (43%) though Lehrer would play a neutral role. This year’s debates are potentially a breakaway moment for either Clinton or Trump who have been running neck-and-neck for weeks in Rasmussen Reports’ White House Watch survey. Trump is ahead by five points in the latest survey, but it’s too early to say if he is gaining any traction over his rival. I consider everything out of both of their pieholes to be a lie, so I have no horse in this race. But, I am in it for the entertainment factor… sort of like eating popcorn during an apocalypse. Frankly, I think this is Trump’s to lose and I highly doubt he will. But I’m sure there are bookies out there laying odds on something going amiss with Clinton: a potty emergency, fainting spell, seizure, brain freeze, coughing fit… any of those and she is toast. Trump looks hale and hearty in comparison. This is the ultimate bread and circuses in America. Behold an election as reality TV. And Trump is known for saying, “You’re fired!” Clinton may very well exit the show stage left tonight.  ",0,0,1
1524,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz recognizes that 2016 is not his year. Despite giving a valiant effort, his presidential campaign ultimately succumbed to populist appeal and the ever-increasing burden of slander.   Because of this, the principled lawmaker ruffled GOP feathers when at the RNC convention, he urged people to vote their conscience and noticeably refrained from offering an endorsement of Donald Trump, the perpetrator of the slander on the campaign trail. For this, Cruz was vilified by many who seemingly never stopped and questioned why when Cruz urged voting for a true conservative, they assumed he was not speaking about the chosen candidate, Trump. After the dust settled, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus stated that those who have not endorsed the Republican nominee may find themselves bereft of GOP support in the future if they intend to mount another presidential run – a run that is highly likely for Cruz. Because of this pressure, Cruz relented to the power of the GOP and offered his endorsement of Trump on Friday, explaining six policy points guiding his decision in a Facebook post. Check it out: This election is unlike any other in our nation’s history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election. In Cleveland, I urged voters, “please, don’t stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket whom you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.” After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. I’ve made this decision for two reasons. First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word. Second, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable — that’s why I have always been #NeverHillary. Six key policy differences inform my decision. First, and most important, the Supreme Court. For anyone concerned about the Bill of Rights — free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amendment — the Court hangs in the balance. I have spent my professional career fighting before the Court to defend the Constitution. We are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights, and the next president will appoint as many as four new justices. We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices “in the mold of Scalia.” For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list. This commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump. Second, Obamacare. The failed healthcare law is hurting millions of Americans. If Republicans hold Congress, leadership has committed to passing legislation repealing Obamacare. Clinton, we know beyond a shadow of doubt, would veto that legislation. Trump has said he would sign it. Third, energy. Clinton would continue the Obama administration’s war on coal and relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry. Trump has said he will reduce regulations and allow the blossoming American energy renaissance to create millions of new high-paying jobs. Fourth, immigration. Clinton would continue and even expand President Obama’s lawless executive amnesty. Trump has promised that he would revoke those illegal executive orders. Fifth, national security. Clinton would continue the Obama administration’s willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism. She would continue importing Middle Eastern refugees whom the FBI cannot vet to make sure they are not terrorists. Trump has promised to stop the deluge of unvetted refugees. Sixth, Internet freedom. Clinton supports Obama’s plan to hand over control of the Internet to an international community of stakeholders, including Russia, China, and Iran. Just this week, Trump came out strongly against that plan, and in support of free speech online. These are six vital issues where the candidates’ positions present a clear choice for the American people. If Clinton wins, we know — with 100% certainty — that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country. My conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that. We also have seen, over the past few weeks and months, a Trump campaign focusing more and more on freedom — including emphasizing school choice and the power of economic growth to lift African-Americans and Hispanics to prosperity. Finally, after eight years of a lawless Obama administration, targeting and persecuting those disfavored by the administration, fidelity to the rule of law has never been more important. The Supreme Court will be critical in preserving the rule of law. And, if the next administration fails to honor the Constitution and Bill of Rights, then I hope that Republicans and Democrats will stand united in protecting our fundamental liberties. Our country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way. A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don’t want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him. I’m not sure that I buy that Cruz’s endorsement is entirely voluntary, but the fact remains that he’s right. Since the time on the campaign trail, Trump’s campaign has become more serious and his policy outlines are more articulated. Still, it would have been nice if Trump had explained his ideas in the primary. Instead, what we got was slander and shady smears. ",0,0,1
235,"(CNN)President Barack Obama on Sunday suggested sexism in society could be hurting Hillary Clinton's White House bid. ""There's a reason why we haven't had a woman president; that we as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women,"" Obama said at a DNC fundraiser in New York City. ""And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly, and that expresses itself in all sorts of ways."" Obama used his short speech at the event to praise Clinton while simultaneously ripping into Republican nominee Donald Trump. ""It's an infomercial. It's a reality show,"" Obama said of the Manhattan businessman. ""This guy is not qualified to be president."" The remarks from Obama come just one day after he made an impassioned plea to African-American voters at the Congressional Black Caucus gala in Washington, D.C., urging them to work to stop Trump. He said it would be a ""personal insult"" to his legacy if black voters did not turn out on Election Day for Hillary Clinton. The fundraiser was held at the home of Audrey and Danny Meyer, who is the CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group in New York City. About 65 attendees were in the room and contributed $25,000. The co-chairs contributed $100,000, while the chairs raised or contributed $250,000. CNN's Allison Malloy contributed to this report.",1,0,0
412,"(CNN)North Korea went on the offensive Friday, blasting the US for ""aggression"" in Asia, blaming Washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the US with ""tremendous consequences beyond imagination."" The Democratic People's Republic of Korea ""had no other choice but to go nuclear,"" Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly, to defend itself ""from the constant nuclear threats from the United States."" Ri's comments came as the US and Asian nations gathered in New York Friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region: North Korea's announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet. The test Tuesday was followed by a US show of force, as the Pentagon on Wednesday flew two B-1B bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, setting the the stage for US-South Korea joint military exercises in October that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike. The heightened tensions, North Korea's steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the Pentagon on notice. ""North Korea's unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland,"" Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday in Maryland. ""It's consumed an awful lot of time -- I think it's fair to say -- of senior leadership's time over the past few weeks."" The North Korean minister offered a through-the-looking glass version of the same events. ""Only a couple of days ago, the United States has again threatened the DPRK by flying the strategic bombers 'B-1B' over the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and landing in South Korea,"" Ri said. ""We will never remain onlookers at it and the United States will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination."" Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry met Friday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc dedicated to economic, political and security cooperation. ""The United States will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies,"" Kerry told the ASEAN meeting. He called on allies to ""vigorously"" enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged ASEAN members to ""ensure that the DPRK pays a price for its dangerous actions."" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a blunt call for international action at the UN Wednesday. ""Right before our eyes, North Korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt,"" Abe said. ""There is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now."" The perceived threat is changing regional dynamics, bringing old rivals Japan and South Korea closer together. It's putting China on the spot as Washington pushes Beijing to do more to rein its ally in, even as tensions over the South China Sea complicate cooperation. And it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions, the likes of which were used to force Iran to the negotiating table. That's still unlikely to stop North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, experts said. Indeed, US officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early October. ""From North Korea's perspective, it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until there's a substantial shift in dialogue with the US,"" said Alison Evans, a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm IHS. ""For North Korea, it's the recognition that's the important thing. It needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized,"" Evans said, adding that, ""The leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival."" RELATED: US B-1 bombers fly over South Korea in show of force US officials say the Pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test. Meanwhile, the Union of Concerned Scientists said there is some speculation that Pyongyang may try another satellite launch around October 10, the anniversary of the founding of its Worker's Party of Korea. North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in January. In the ensuing months, it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests, including land- and submarine-based launches. In May, North Korea's 32-year-old leader Kim Jong-un made the country's ambitions official, announcing that Pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy. Pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on September 9, the anniversary of the DPRK's founding in 1948. And Tuesday's rocket launch was ""substantially larger and more powerful than anything North Korea has tested before,"" according to 38 North, a program devoted to analyzing North Korea at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. All this testing is unlikely to win it the US recognition it craves, though. After the more recent nuclear test, President Barack Obama made clear that ""the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state."" Obama said that the US would work with Asian allies, the UN Security Council and international partners to implement existing measures and ""take additional significant steps, including new sanctions to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions."" However, the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that Obama administration will soon no longer calling the American shots on the issue. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has held out the possibility of meeting with Kim in a dramatic break with US political conventions. He earned criticism for the remark, as well as for suggesting that South Korea and Japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons. ""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea,"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee in March. ""We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself."" The statements have rattled Tokyo and Seoul, and while Trump has said that China must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally, his promise to play tough with Beijing on trade could also roil that effort. The Republican candidate's tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding American policy in the region and is likely to be something that US officials are asked to address in their consultations Friday.  Hillary Clinton has also articulated a strong stance on China, but is less likely to take the protectionist steps that could spark a trade war with the Asian power. On North Korea, specifically, she has emphasized ratcheting up US sanctions. International sanctions levied in March after the January nuclear test were the first on North Korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite. They ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country, among other steps. The international community could squeeze North Korea further by targeting the export of its resources, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, echoing the way UN sanctions targeted Iran by banning the export of its oil. ""That is a big step,"" Klingner said, ""it will impact the people of North Korea."" China signed on for the March sanctions, but its officials have repeatedly said they believe sanctions are counterproductive and experts say China historically hasn't thoroughly enforced them against North Korea. US tensions with China over the South China Sea could make it harder to cooperate. Dunford said Wednesday that ""China seeks to limit our ability to project power and to undermine the credibility of our alliances in the Pacific."" The US can take additional unilateral steps to get tougher on Pyongyang, Klingner said, by sanctioning non-North Korean entities that act as an agent for the country -- most likely Chinese entities and financial institutions. In the meantime, US military officials are planning. From October 3 to 21, the US and South Korea will carry out the joint exercise ""Red Flag"" in Alaska, which will include an aerial exercise ""simulating attacks on nuclear facilities and scenarios of sudden missile attack,"" a ministry spokesperson with the South Korean Defense Department told CNN. North Korea derided South Korea as a ""puppet warmongers"" in a statement about the Red Flag exercises.

3,"One day after explosive devices were discovered in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea and in Seaside Park and Elizabeth in New Jersey, Republican nominee Donald Trump repeated his calls to implement police profiling to stop more attacks in the United States. ""Our local police, they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don't want to be accused of profiling and they don't want to be accused of all sorts of things,"" Trump said on ""Fox and Friends"" when asked what policies he would implement as president to ""get tough"" on terrorism. He argued that the country had no other choice but to follow the lead of Israel. ""Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they will profile. They profile. They see somebody that's suspicious,"" he said, ""they will profile. They will take that person in and check out. Do we have a choice? Look what's going on. Do we really have a choice? We're trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse."" Trump previously made similar comments. After the Orlando nightclub shooting in June, he said in an interview on ""Face the Nation"" that it was something the U.S. needed to seriously consider.",1,0,0
1282,"Our policy reporters truth-squad the 2016 presidential debates. “We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI, one lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to congress, and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail.” — Donald Trump Trump referred to the guilty plea former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright, who pled guilty on Monday to a felony charge of making false statements to the FBI in connection with an investigation into leaks about a U.S.-Israel cyber operation to undermine Iran’s nuclear program. A number of statements Clinton made about her use of a private email server have turned out to be dubious or inaccurate, although FBI Director James Comey has said he does not believe that Clinton made false statements to his agency during its investigation. Republican lawmakers have questioned several of Clinton’s statements, including her claim that none of her emails were marked classified, when three had portion markings for classified records — but not proper markings at the top and bottom. Other Clinton statements have also been questioned, although she often couched them as an inability to recall certain events, making it difficult to label them as lies. Clinton said last week in written answers to a federal lawsuit that she did not recall any communcation with computer aide Bryan Pagliano about management or preservation of records in her account, but a conservative group said it has a 2012 email exchange between Clinton and Pagliano about her not receiving messages on her blackberry. During the court hearing this week, Cartwright admitted that he provided and confirmed classified information to one reporter and confirmed classified information to another, although as part of a plea bargain he pled guilty to lying to investigators and not to leaking, which could have carried a more severe penalty. He could receive up to five years in prison on the lying charge. ""Aleppo is a disaster. It is a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen...from any standpoint."" - Trump Donald Trump has said in two debates the Syrian city ""has fallen"" or ""has basically fallen."" While the situation has been described as dire, the city is still contested. Forces of the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian air strikes are still facing off against Syrian rebel forces. “If you look at your voter rolls, you'll see millions of people that are registered to vote. Millions. This isn't coming from me. This is coming from Pew report and other places. Millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.” — Donald Trump Tonight, Donald Trump tonight cited a Pew Center on the States report which found that around 24 million voter registrations in the U.S. are either invalid or are very inaccurate. The report goes further and finds that 1.8 million dead people are actually listed as voters. “Voter registration in the United States largely reflects its 19th-century origins and has not kept pace with advancing technology and a mobile society,” the report’s authors write, adding that “states’ systems must be brought into the 21st century to be more accurate, cost-effective, and efficient.” That noted, the report did not say that these registrants had in fact voted — nor did it suggest that voter fraud is commonplace as Trump has claimed in the past. “The premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year, they're going to go up over 100 percent.” — Donald Trump In tonight's debate, Trump went even further on his claims about Obamacare premium increases than he has in the past. There are states with extremely high premium increases slated for Obamacare plans in 2017 — some states, like Minnesota and Oklahoma, have reported that average rate increases will top 60 percent and 70 percent. But those numbers aren’t reflective of what’s going on nationally, even if there are outliers where rate increases are especially large. Premium increases will vary highly depending on the local market and insurance company. The large premium increases Trump cited do not tell the entire story, and they do not account for the government subsidies that millions of Americans can receive under the health care law to lower their monthly premiums. “What I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt.” — Hillary Clinton This is a gray area. Clinton’s planned tax increases would boost revenues by about $1.4 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. But she’s also proposed increasing spending on a handful of policy priorities, and it’s not clear how she would pay for all of her plans. For instance, she has said she would finance infrastructure investments with “business tax reform,” but hasn’t detailed what that would look like. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Clinton’s policies would add $200 billion to the debt over 10 years, when measured against the projected levels under current law. (Trump’s plans, the group found, would add $5.3 trillion to the debt.) Ultimately, it’s hard to measure without more detailed policy proposals. “I believe it was her campaign that did it just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence. She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people. They paid them $1500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.” – Donald Trump Getting one thing out of the way. There's no evidence President Barack Obama had any role in violence at Trump rallies. For Clinton and her campaign, it's more complicated. Two Democratic political operatives with ties to her White House bid have indeed been caught up in a conservative group’s sting operation that appears to suggest efforts to send plants into the Trump's rallies to cause trouble. The Democrats — Robert Creamer, the husband of Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, and contractor Scott Foval — both have left their jobs this week after several edited videos appeared produced by conservative activist James O’Keefe and his group Project Veritas Action. In one of the videos, Foval, the national field director for Americans United for Change, discussed with an O’Keefe operative, who was posing as an intern, a strategy that included sending plants into Trump rallies to pick fights with his supporters. “I mean, honestly, it’s not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off,” he says in the video. “It’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into their rally, in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt. Or ‘Trump is a Nazi,’ you know. You can message to draw them out, and draw them out to punch you.” In another video, Foval calls himself “the white hat” while and describes Creamer’s group, Democracy Partners, as the “dark hat.” Foval was fired Monday. Both the Clinton campaign and the DNC have condemned the tactics described in the videos while also denying playing any role in sending protestors into Trump rallies. Interim DNC chair Donna Brazile in a statement reported by CNN also turned the tables on O’Keefe, calling him “a convicted criminal with a history of doctoring video to advance his ideological agenda.” Creamer, who stepped down from his post Tuesday, told CNN that Foval’s comments were “flat out wrong.” He also issued a statement saying his firm “has recently been the victim of a well-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the Watergate burglars.” “The plot involved the use of trained operatives using false identifications, disguises and elaborate false covers to infiltrate our firm and others, in order to steal campaign plans, and goad unsuspecting individuals into making careless statements on hidden cameras,” he said. ""Well, you know, once again Donald is implying he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is… What is a very clear fact that before the invasion he supported it. Google Donald Trump Iraq and you'll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq."" — Hillary Clinton ""Wrong."" — Donald Trump Trump has repeatedly claimed he opposed the war in Iraq, but the public record suggests the opposite. During a 2002 interview with Howard Stern, Trump was asked if he supported invading Iraq. “Yeah, I guess so,” Trump responded. “I wish the first time it was done correctly.” These comments were first unearthed by Buzzfeed earlier this year and show that Trump was at best ambivalent about the war — but there is no public record of him opposing it. “Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders.” — Donald Trump By most metrics, describing Clinton’s immigration plan as “amnesty” is a mischaracterization. Clinton’s immigration plan says she’ll “introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within her first 100 days in office.” According to PolitiFact, Clinton supports two programs for deferred action designation by the Department of Homeland Security — but that’s not the same as amnesty, which the legal dictionary defines as “a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out.” Clinton also supported “Gang of Eight” immigration reform plan that called for enhanced border security and E-Verify. Debate moderator Chris Wallace pointed out that Clinton used the phrase “open borders” in an excerpt from a paid-speech excerpt released by Wikileaks. But Clinton appears to be talking about trade and energy (though it’s a little hard to see the full context, because the excerpt is only a paragraph long): “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” “This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He has advocated more countries getting them. Japan. Korea. Even Saudi Arabia.” — Hillary Clinton The Clinton campaign has blasted Trump for being too cavalier on nuclear weapons, including advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to countries like Saudi Arabia, Japan and South Korea. On several occasions, Trump indicated an openness to other nations to obtain nuclear weapons, citing the cost of the U.S. to protect countries against regional threats. “Well I think maybe it’s not so bad to have Japan — if Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us,” Trump said in an interview with the New York Times, referencing the nation's ability to protect itself against a nuclear threat from North Korea. And asked by Cooper if he had “no problem with Japan an South Korea” having nukes, Trump responded: “ At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea. We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself.” All noted, Trump’s past statements and positions on nuclear proliferation have been contradictory. This story has been updated with additional context. ""People contribute. I contribute. The money goes, 100 percent, to a lot of charities, including a lot of military.” — Donald Trump Per the reporting of Washington Post’s David Farenthold, Trump has not contributed to his own foundation since 2008. The foundation has also been used for non-charitable purposes, including contributing illegally to a political candidate, buying a portrait of Trump and settling a lawsuit. “When you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department. Six billion was either stolen, they don't know. It is gone. $6 billion.” — Donald Trump “Well, first of all, what he just said about the State department is not only untrue, it’s been debunked numerous times.” — Hillary Clinton Clinton is right: Trump is repeating a falsehood. Short version: There was missing paperwork, not missing dollars. The Washington Post has the long version. “[Trump] held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough… to be assaulted.” — Hillary Clinton “I did not say that.” — Donald Trump While Trump has not said that explicitly, he has repeatedly suggested it over the last week. Regarding People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who recently alleged Trump forcibly kissed her in 2005, Trump said last week in Cincinnati: “Take a look. Look at her. Look at her words. And you tell me what you think. I don’t think so.” During a rally in North Carolina last Friday, Trump said of Jessica Leeds, the woman that accused him of groping her on an airplane in the 1980s: “Believe me, she would not be my first choice. That I can tell you. You don’t know. That would not be my first choice.”",1,0,0
1429,"Make no mistake: the political differences ripping America apart are not merely political ones, but cultural ones as well. We are a culture at war with ourselves. We are separated into the “victim” role and the supposed “oppressor” role. Straights, whites and Christians are alleged to be the oppressors of all others and a new breed of radicalism has crept up to instill social warfare against these groups to further a self-pitying social and political agenda.   Black Lives Matter is a domestic hate group that furthers hatred for whites and for police officers in a way that the KKK has fostered hatred for minorities. Now, according to outspoken conservative Milo Yiannopoulos, it’s time to criminalize this hate group. “The left does this insane sleight of hand where they try to suggest not liking Black Lives Matter is the same thing as hating black people,” he said during his visit to the University of Houston for his “Dangerous Faggot” tour. “No one is stupid enough to believe that but they keep doing it,” he added. Yiannopoulos admitted that there are problems plaguing black communities, but suggested that BLM is not the solution, saying that a “violent movement that throws its toys out the pram and leaves black communities in ruins is [not] the answer to those problems.” “We are entering the black power phase of Black Lives Matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organization. It’s time to criminalize it,” he stated. While it would be unconstitutional and wrong to criminalize political speech of any kind, we cannot escape the precedent that is already in place. The KKK is (thankfully) a tattered shred of what it used to be in terms of organization after it was ruled that their urging of violence in the name of hatred was a conspiratorial enterprise to commit lawlessness. While any bigot – black or white – should be free to spout off their nonsense, it is time to delegitimize these racists by holding them responsible for the violent conduct they encourage and urge.

604,"In 2004 President George W. Bush ran a hard-fought reelection campaign against a popular, if doofy, Democrat opponent John Kerry. For all of his faults, Kerry was far more well-liked and far less scandal plagued than today’s Democrat candidate. Bush was able to eke out a reelection victory mostly on the shoulders of his decisive reaction to the 9/11 tragedy. In fact, the 2004 election made the phrase “security moms” famous, as the once known “soccer mom” had suddenly awakened to our dangerous new world where Islamic terrorism was the reality and her “mama bear” instincts had taken over. The “security mom” knew she had to do all she could to care for her loved ones, and that now meant using her vote to keep them safe. Fast forward 12 years to the 2016 presidential election and the new generation of “security moms” will soon be playing a pivotal role (again) in another national election. The 2016 version of these security minded voters seem to be preparing to hand the presidency to GOP candidate Donald Trump, and the events of this past weekend explain why. On Saturday morning a pipe bomb exploded just before the start of a 5k fun run in Seaside Park, New Jersey. The event was called off and authorities swept the area finding two more unexploded devices. Later that night, a pressure cooker bomb exploded in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 people and sending the city into a panic. Shortly after the explosion authorities swept the surrounding neighborhood and found another unexploded device a few blocks away. Come Sunday morning, liberals and their friends in the media were busy condemning Donald Trump’s comments about the explosions being “bombs” and about the likelihood that we were witnessing a terrorist act. Trump’s opponents were practically hyperventilating about his “rash” response and his “haste” to judgment, all while arguing that there was “no evidence” of a connection to Islam or to terrorist organizations. Then late Sunday evening authorities arrested five “persons of interest” around the same time that 5 more bombs were being discovered in an Elizabeth, New Jersey train station. By early Monday morning police had captured Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized American citizen of Afghani descent, who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Rahami, it turns out, was a “known wolf” with ties to international Muslim terrorism. By the time the East Coast was waking up, liberals were beginning to realize that Donald Trump had been right all along… Consider New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s comments on Sunday: Absent a motivation, Mr. de Blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used, shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way. “Here is what we know: It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing — that’s what we know,” he said on Sunday, flanked by law enforcement officials at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. “To understand there were any specific motivations, political motivations, any connection to an organization — that’s what we don’t know.” The liberal reticence at calling terrorism terrorism never ceases to amaze me. It’s as though de Blasio believes that if you say the word terrorism you automatically mean that a Muslim person has carried out a violent act. Taking his own words – “It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing…” this is the very definition of terrorism. It’s an act meant to incite a reaction. The only reason anyone would ever set off a bomb without some other concurring criminal act (like using a bomb to rob a bank), would be for terroristic purposes. Yet, de Blasio couldn’t bring himself to use the word and instead just described the act of terrorism to reporters. Even New York’s liberal Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), who was slow to call the act terrorism on Saturday, had changed his tune by Sunday. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism. A bomb going off is generically a terrorist activity.” But by Monday de Blasio’s tune finally changed. “We have reason to believe this was an act of terror,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. A-duh. Here’s a newsflash, Bill… every other thinking person in America has already come to this conclusion. Thanks for joining us. Meanwhile, while de Blasio was busy dissembling, Hillary Clinton was busy using the terrorism to attack Donald Trump for being to hard on terrorism. I kid you not. Clinton’s argument is that Donald Trump’s mean words are going to make the terrorists dislike us even more, so they’re going to do more terroristy things. “I don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,” Clinton said. “We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“ Clinton says Trump’s rhetoric has “given aid and comfort” to terrorists. Phrase is definition of treason. — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 19, 2016  This is an amazing argument to make, considering that the Obama/Clinton foreign policy era has been one of appeasement and uber-careful rhetoric (when it comes to Islam) and yet, Islamic terrorism is worse today than ever before! Ultimately, it won’t be the cavalcade of corruption, or the litany of scandals, or the lies, or her obviously failing health that ends Hillary Clinton’s hopes of being President. No, it will be the glaring differences between Clinton and Trump on dealing with the very real threat we face from Islamic terrorism. More Americans will decide that to continue the Obama/Clinton policy of appeasement and apology would be insanity, and that America would be safer handing the reins of leadership to Donald Trump. The liberal response to this weekend’s terrorism is why Donald Trump will be elected the next President of the United States, and it’s why the terrorist supporters at CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are so worried.

436,"Washington (CNN)Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency Friday afternoon, a stunning turn of events after a contentious primary filled with nasty personal attacks and a dramatic snub at the Republican National Convention. ""After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,"" Cruz wrote in a Facebook post. ""A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him."" ""I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz,"" Trump said in a statement obtained by CNN. ""We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again."" The move -- three days before Trump's critical first debate with Clinton -- comes as the Trump and Cruz camps have moved closer in recent weeks. Trump's vice presidential nominee Mike Pence played a key role in bringing Cruz into the fold. Pence and Cruz traded multiple messages, then spoke at length once on the phone and again in person, when Pence visited Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, a source close to Pence said. Ted Cruz fast facts Trump has hired key Cruz allies such as Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager, and Jason Miller as a spokesman. Wednesday, Trump's campaign expressed support for a Cruz-backed, Internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the Senate. Friday, Trump released a new list of conservative judges likely to appeal to the former Supreme Court clerk -- including perhaps Cruz's closest friend in Congress, Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Cruz cited Trump's pledges on the judiciary in his Facebook post. ""We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices 'in the mold of (the late Antonin) Scalia,' Cruz wrote. ""For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list."" A Cruz endorsement could be the last pillar to helping Trump shore up the support of conservatives who have remained reticent about supporting his campaign. Trump has already gotten most Republicans and conservatives on board with his campaign -- largely by reassuring them on the Supreme Court and on issues like the Second Amendment and abortion. But Cruz's principled opposition to offering his support has given some conservatives high-profile cover. Just as Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump at the RNC fueled Democrats' efforts to paint Trump as divisive even within his own party, Cruz's endorsement will help undermine that narrative -- suggesting to conservatives unsure about Trump that perhaps the brash billionaire has changed, and can be trusted to bring conservative change to Washington. 'Lyin' Ted' and 'utterly amoral' The move marks a dramatic turnaround from the personal insults Cruz and Trump traded during the previous year. The two men clashed repeatedly during the primaries, as Trump taunted the senator with the nickname ""Lyin' Ted,"" suggested Cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his Canadian birthplace, and even speculated that Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. Trump also said Cruz should ""be careful"" or he would ""spill the beans on your wife,"" and retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz. Those tweets have not been deleted from Trump's account. On his last day of the GOP campaign -- the Indiana primary in early May -- Cruz let loose against Trump, calling the businessman a ""serial philanderer,"" ""utterly amoral,"" and ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen. At the RNC in Cleveland, Cruz gave a memorable speech espousing conservative values but ended without endorsing Trump, as Trump allies booed from the convention floor. ""Don't stay home in November,"" Cruz said. ""Stand and speak and vote your conscience."" The next day, he defended the move by citing Trump's attacks against his family. ""I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,"" Cruz told members of the Texas delegation. ""That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi that I'm going to nonetheless come as a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'"" After the convention, Trump said that he would not accept Cruz's endorsement if he offered it. ""I don't want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it, just so you understand. If he gives it I will -- I will not accept. It won't matter. Honestly he should've done it because nobody cares and he would've been in better shape for four years from now,"" Trump said. Facing Senate primary in 2018? Cruz's move may also be politically expedient. He faces a possible 2018 Senate primary challenge from Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who has increasingly made an issue of Cruz's failure to endorse Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has said Republicans who don't back Trump could pay a price down the road. And Trump also floated the idea of setting up a super PAC to oppose Cruz if he decided to run for office again. Clinton's campaign, after Cruz's message posted on Facebook, was happy to note a number of shots Cruz took at Trump during the primary, including when he called on the businessman to release his tax returns. Clinton's official twitter account retweeted a tweet Cruz sent during the primary that said, ""I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his!"" Clinton's campaign has been hounding Trump to release his taxes, arguing that he isn't doing so because they show shady business deals and ties to Russia. Trump has said he would release his taxes after an IRS audit. Clinton's vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Austin, Texas, Friday, said he couldn't support someone who used the same language Trump did about Cruz's father. ""I just can't help but say this,"" Kaine said. ""Donald Trump suggested that Ted Cruz's dad was involved in the JFK assassination. Now we know that that is false, but false isn't, there's not the right word to describe what that is. It is so outrageously false. And as far as I know Donald Trump has not retracted it. As far as I know he has not apologized for it. And so if somebody said that about my dad they would never have me as a supporter for anything."" Radio host Steve Deace tweeted his disappointment, calling the move a mistake and speculating that Cruz backers may not all follow the senator. ""I think it's the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. I hope I am wrong. The people will decide that,"" Deace tweeted. CNN's Jeremy Diamond, Tom LoBianco, Dan Merica, Betsy Klein, and Dan Berman contributed to this report.",1,0,0
838,"In case it wasn’t clear enough already, Black Lives Matter truly is an anti-police group. We’ve all heard the talking point before, that they’re “anti-police brutality, not anti-police” but their actions betray them. One of the co-founders of the BLM movement, Alicia Garzia, proved that the movement was anti-cop just the other day when she called for “cop-free” zones. She had explained (as quoted in the Daily Caller) that “The United States gives too much respect to police officers, explaining that when police do wrong, a few bad cops are blamed, rather than a “corroded and corrupt system.” She concluded that “Quite frankly, many of our [Black Lives Matter] members are continuing to investigate what it would mean to have police-free communities. I think what we’ve continued to see over time is that no moral appeal is actually stopping the deaths of black people, whether they be armed or unarmed.” Does she not realize that more black lives would be lost if their communities lacked police? Apparently not. We’ve seen the horrible chants of BLM before, whether it be “What do we want? Dead cops!” or “pigs in a blanket, fry em like bacon!” and now they have a new one. As Breitbart reported: At least one Black Lives Matter protester in Houston was reported to yell “F**k blue lives” while others chanted “Pig, pig, bang, bang.” The anti-police rhetoric came during a protest march in Houston’s predominantly black historic Third Ward on Saturday evening. The protest began in McGregor Park after the release of the dashcam video by Charlotte, North Carolina, police showing the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man, by a black police officer. On September 22, a white female officer in Tulsa was charged with first-degree manslaughter after she shot and killed Terence Crutcher. As reported by Breitbart News and the AP, Officer Betty Shelby was charged after dashcam and aerial footage showed the shooting and Crutcher walking away from the officer with his arms in the air. The footage does not include a clear view of when the officer fired the sole shot that killed the 40-year-old black man. At one point, a confrontation developed between the protesters and police, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Keri Blakinger. The standoff occurred in a parking lot on the University of Houston campus. Ultimately, the protesters backed up and took a different path. “F**k blue lives,” shouted one protester that Blakinger described as “particularly incensed.” She reported others chanting “Pig, pig, bang, bang.” The protesters occasionally blocked street intersections remained peaceful and out of the flow of traffic during the protest. These are the crazies that Hillary Clinton is sympathizing with. Is there any surprise that the largest police union in America endorsed Trump? Of course not. BLM has only made racial tensions worse, and widened the divide between police and the public. This certainly will benefit Trump this election (and harm Hillary), but we can only hope that the damage they’ve done is reversible. What do you all think? Isn’t it time for more of those representing us in Congress to denounce BLM as the terror group it is? Let us know in the comments and be sure to share this post on Facebook and Twitter. ",0,0,1
1133,"It was Hillary Clinton's idea to appear on “Between Two Ferns,” the irreverent web series hosted by comedian Zach Galifianakis, the program's executive producer told POLITICO. The Democratic presidential nominee took a page from President Barack Obama’s playbook with her appearance on “Between Two Ferns” Thursday. Clinton’s team got the ball rolling only after the Democratic presidential nominee told the Senate Democratic Caucus how impressed she was with Obama’s 2014 appearance on the show to pitch the Affordable Care Act. “It was actually her idea, strangely enough,” comedian Scott Aukerman, who directs and executive produces the web series, said. “… She told her team she wanted to do it and that she really liked the one with President Obama, so that kind of made the process really easy. We didn’t have to go through the hoops we sometimes have to go through in order to even get Hollywood people to do it.” The interview was taped on Sept. 9, the same day Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia by her doctor. It wasn’t until later that the Funny or Die production team found out Clinton had been fighting pneumonia when she settled in for the interview. Aukerman said she arrived at the end of the day, a couple of hours behind their original scheduled time, but the crew had no idea she had been feeling unwell. “We kind of went, ‘she had pneumonia?!,’” Aukerman said. “We couldn’t believe it. The one clue we had was that she was drinking hot water.” The interview was taped at the New York Historical Society, and Aukerman said it was mostly improvised. As a result of the improvisation, most of the questions Galifianakis asked Clinton had not been cleared with the candidate or with Clinton’s team. Aukerman said that it is unlikely that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, will make a similar appearance on the show. “No, we have not invited Trump to do 'Between Two Ferns,'” Aukerman said. “I don’t think he would do it … I don’t think he has thick enough skin."" ""I wouldn’t be surprised if his team reached out, but I’d be surprised if it ever were to happen in the same way this happened, with us being able to improvise questions,"" he added. If Trump does do the show, don't be surprised if it is quietly released with little fanfare, just as Clinton's interview was. ""We hadn’t done one in a couple years so we don’t overdo them, so every time we do one, it’s a surprise,"" Aukerman said. ""We don’t put out press releases that we're about to put one out, we sneak them out in the middle of the night.""",1,0,0
105,"Montel Williams isnât afraid to express his absolute disgust and disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump â heâs made it perfectly clear in the past that he would never support or vote for him, and continuously speaks out against the business mogul.

When Williams saw Burns complaining about the mediaâs hesitance to call the weekend explosions in New York City a terror attack, he couldnât just let it slide.

669,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person. Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant  incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments.  New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment? The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.”  Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

462,"Rye Brook, New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton might be viewed as the favorite going into Monday's presidential debate. But she certainly didn't prepare like one. Clinton, a candidate known for being a homebody, was for most of the three nights leading up to Monday's debate working at a hotel a few miles from her Chappaqua, New York home, hunkered down with aides in a nondescript conference center surrounded by wedding parties and high school reunion goers. Clinton spent Friday, Saturday and Sunday night at the Doral Arrowwood, returning home past 11 p.m. every night after sessions with a tight group of aides and advisers. The late night sessions appeared to mimic the timing of Monday's debate at Hofstra University, which will run 90 minutes and start at 9 p.m. Clinton's prep was not limited to late at night, however. On Saturday and Sunday, Clinton visited the hotel twice a day: Once at night and again for a few hours in the afternoon. RELATED: Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle The frequency and timing of the sessions -- hours before Clinton meets Donald Trump -- are an acknowledgment that the former secretary of state took her debate preparations seriously, investing four days of would-be campaigning to find a way to do what no Republican candidate could: Defeat Trump. The sessions also mimic Clinton, a candidate who aides refer to as a worrier. ""Like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over prepare,"" Clinton said at Greensboro, North Carolina event earlier this month. ""I sweat the details."" Trump, on the other hand, has said that he doesn't want to over-prepare for Monday's debate. While he met with top advisers on Sunday to hash out debate strategy, the Republican nominee has largely eschewed with traditional debate prep, deciding instead to trust his instincts on Monday night. Jason Miller, Trump's spokesman, mocked Clinton's two-a-day preparation on Monday morning. ""That might be something to brag about when you are getting ready to high school football but I am not sure heading into arguably the biggest presidential debate that our country has ever seen that that is something that you want to be putting out there,"" Miller said. The Doral Arrowwood, a 337-room hotel better known locally as an event space and golf course, is an odd scene for such preparations: As Clinton worked with aides, the hotel was busy hosting a high school reunion, a wedding and a meeting of pharmaceutical employees. Clinton entered and exited the hotel through a back entrance and her van positioned so that she did not have to walk through the lobby to get to the conference center hosting her prep. Hotel guests were however aware of Clinton's presence and her secret service protected van was parked near the main entrance of the hotel. Aides worry that expectations for Clinton's performance might be impossibly high, given the fact that Monday's contest will be over her 40 televised debate, including contests during her 2008 presidential run and her Senate run in 2000. RELATED: 5 things to watch at Monday night's Clinton-Trump debate Blatantly playing the expectations game, aides have publicly looked to muddy the view that Clinton should dominate on Monday by touting Trump's reality show personality and showman qualities. Their argument: Debates are about theater more than substance, and on that measure Trump has more experience. ""For all his lack of substance, Trump's showmanship, as ex-reality TV star, makes him a formidable debate foe. He thrashed his rivals in GOP debates,"" Brian Fallon, Clinton's national press secretary, tweeted in August. To try to compensate -- and knock Trump off his game -- people advising Clinton have been looking for one-line retorts that could become memorable moments from the contest. The all-day sessions are being led by Ron Klain, who advised President Barack Obama, and Karen Dunn, a longtime lawyer and aide. RELATED: Donald Trump's 6 debate tactics Clinton was joined in the sessions by Huma Abedin, her longtime aide; John Podesta, her campaign chairman; and Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top policy aide, according to the sources. Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser known for his combative style and fierce loyalty to Clinton, is playing Trump in debate prep. Reines has spent more time playing ""Presidential Trump"" than ""bombastic Trump,"" according to a source with knowledge of the prep. Reines, in an effort to prepare Clinton for a more polished Trump, has even ad lib an opening statement heralding the milestone of Clinton becoming the first woman nominee of a major presidential party, the source says. What Donald Trump shows up has been a key concern for Clinton's top aides, including that small group of advisers who have been inside her debate prep. According to the source, the aides expect Trump to be a more polished, reserved candidate than the boisterous and off-the-cuff candidate that has been seen across the country on the campaign's trail. The source says Clinton has done some prep with ""bombastic Trump,"" but more have been with a more reserved candidate. Earlier in the process, Clinton spent hours watching a highlight reel of Trump's Republican primary debates, according to several people familiar with her debate preparation. She took notes on what agitated him and studied his positions with the hopes of getting under his skin with her familiarity. Clinton has told friends and supporters that her biggest concern is not knowing which Donald Trump will show up on Monday night: A more moderate, controlled Republican nominee or the more blunt and combative candidate? ""I do not know which Donald Trump will show up,"" Clinton said at an August fundraiser in New York. ""Maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasn't done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points.""

As Written By Kevin Diaz for the Houston Chronicles: Texas, which has taken in more refugees than any state in the nation over the past year, is threatening to leave the federal refugee program if the Obama administration does not meet its security demands. The dispute comes as the Obama administration has announced a new goal of resettling 110,000 refugees in the United States in the coming year, including an unspecified increase in the number from Syria. In a letter Wednesday to Robert Carey, director of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission said that unless Washington “unconditionally” approves the state’s new plan controlling placements in Texas by September 30, the agency will “exit” the program.

You didn’t just take his life. And if you’re out here and you see this and you’re listening, look at what you did to this family.” When his aunt Virginia Riley took to the microphone, she called out Black Lives Matter, who has been noticeably silent during this whole case. “Don’t turn your back this time, y’all. We really need to find the solution or real, I mean, if you all talk about ‘Black Lives Matter,’ this life did matter.“ Unfortunately, this is just one of the 500 murders that have taken place in Chicago during 2016 alone. Without a doubt, this is one of the most heartbreaking cases of murder that the country has ever seen, but it will fade from the headlines soon enough. The nation will forget young Demetrius’ face, but a family and a community will be affected forever. They will have to walk to the mailbox remembering when Demetrius would walk the neighborhood dogs around the block. They will continue living in the house filled with his laughter and memories of his adorable face and piercing blue eyes. Black lives DO matter, just as much as every other life on the planet.

Before I show you the video I want you to understand that Black Lives Matter movement has much less to do with black people than a movement to completely destroy America and change it into something it’s not. Black Lives Matter released the platform demanding that ALL police departments be de-funded, race-based reparations for something that happened hundreds of years ago that has zero to do with any living person now, voting rights should be given illegal immigrants (unheard of anywhere else in the world), an end to private education and charter schools (as if the educational system didn’t suck enough in this country but they trust in the ‘system’ of public schools just not cops, a “universal basic income,” which is already provided to millions of Americans called welfare and free college for blacks (not anyone else’s responsibility to pay for this but you). So basically a guy stands on the sidewalk with a Black Lives Matter sign and not much happens. THEN he stands on the sidewalk with an All Lives Matter sign and all havoc breaks loose. People start behaving as if he has just said the worst insult about their mother. One guy even yelled “all lives don’t matter, only black lives matter”. That’s a pretty scary prospect when you have groups of people who start believing lives don’t matter. After I watched the video I read the comments and commented on a few. My jaw is hitting the floor reading how uneducated some of the commenters were… one of them believes America has had slavery for 600 years. I suggested he try simple math 2016-1492= NOT 600. Then someone mentioned that whites invented racism and I had to point out who sold blacks into slavery from Africa to the British. Check out the video… based on the videos of Black Lives Matter riots the past 2 years I am not surprised:   ",0,0,1
1434,"According to Barack Obama, what is necessary for countries to defeat terrorism is not a steadfast resolve to decimate these savages with sophisticated military operations. It is not a steadfast resolve to bring the fight to radical Islam. Nope, according to Barack Obama, the answer for countering terrorism rests in submitting to a one-world style of government and a willingness to “limit freedom.”   Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Obama told world leaders that our only hope is to rely upon collaborative bodies of government like the UN and relinquishing our freedoms – our “freedom of action” as he put it. Obama also stated that “powerful nations” like the U.S. will have to limit their freedom in order to submissively submit to the will of the international body – a belief for which Obama acknowledges he has been criticized. “We have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” The UN was a noble experiment, but one that has long been proven to be a failed one. The practical purpose of the UN is nothing more than serving as an agency for redistribution of wealth and power amongst nations. In this body, the U.S. and other powerful nations do the heavy lifting and are only rewarded with limitations, cynicism and collectivist-inspired resentment from other nations. Since America elected a president who prioritizes the needs of other nations over the needs of the one he has sworn to serve, we have fared poorly on the global stage and it is hardly surprising to see that our outgoing coward has remained true to his vision of one-world governance and limitations of freedom throughout the world. Remember when America had presidents that believed in America so much that they stressed that the rest of the world should try to strive for our kind of ideals instead of the other way around?

524,"Washington (CNN)Senate Democrats on Tuesday blocked a Republican bill to fund the government and battle Zika because it did not include money for Flint, Michigan, to address the city's drinking water crisis. The action comes three days before Friday's midnight deadline when agencies are set to run out of money and left congressional leaders searching for a compromise bill that could get enough votes to pass and head off an election season government shutdown. Needing 60 votes to pass, the measure failed 45-55. While 12 GOP senators also voted against the measure -- for reasons ranging from concerns over spending to the bill's lack of language making changes to the Export-Import Bank -- it was the solid block of ""nay"" votes from Democrats that halted the bill. One possible solution was suggested by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said he might drop flood money for Louisiana and other states to satisfy Democrats who insisted they would not support emergency disaster aid for some states while leaving Flint behind. ""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods. And that's certainly an option worth discussing,"" McConnell told reporters. Democrats didn't immediately say if they would accept the GOP proposal. ""There's no excuse for leaving the people of Flint, Michigan, behind. If they're helping Louisiana, they have to help Flint,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said. Senate Republicans, who earlier this month overwhelmingly backed a major water projects bill that included $220 million for Flint, said they would push the Republicans who control the House to do the same. But Democrats said without an iron-clad agreement, the Flint funds would pass the House they would continue to block the short-term government funding bill. ""Why do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood,"" asked Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, who said he didn't object to Flint money going into the government funding bill. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is anxious to clear the Zika funding that will directly aid his state, argued Democrats are ""looking for any excuse to shut down the government because they think it will help them in the upcoming election."" But Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democratic leader, said the government funding bill would pass ""in an instant"" if Republicans agreed to add money for Flint. ""Democrats are going to oppose this bill because it pits victims of one crisis against victims of another and unfairly offers a cold shoulder to those in Flint while providing aid to other Americans,"" Schumer said.

1620,"Just days after the University of North Dakota (UND) was nationally embarrassed over a student’s racist snap, the college is in hot water once again. In another Snapchat post that could potentially damage the university’s reputation and recruitment efforts for African American students, a group of white female students are seen wearing blackface, with the caption “Black Lives Matter.”  The snap was discovered just over 24 hours after a previous snap that three white female students posted after stealing an African American roommate’s phone and locking her out of her dorm room. In that post, three white female students are all smiling, and the caption on the photo reads, “Locked the black bitch out!”  While the university has already opened an investigation into the first photo, University of North Dakota Mark Kennedy said the second racist social media post in two days shows that the school has a lot of work to do to educate students on diversity, inclusion, and respect for others. In a public statement issued Friday evening, Kennedy said he will personally undertake an endeavor to build out a diversity education initiative for UND students. I have been disappointed to learn that we have people in our university community who don’t know that the kind of behavior and messaging demonstrated in these two photos is not ok, and that, in fact, it is inexcusable. Our mission is educational in nature. Our student conduct process is educational in nature. This is our opportunity to provide an education to all members of our campus community, especially those who may not understand the gravity of their actions. Based upon my conversations with students and others, I can assure you that the messages of the two photos are painful to many individuals. I have heard from many within our campus community, as well as alums and individuals not directly connected to the University, who are encouraging us to use this situation as an opportunity to address what some see as long standing issues within our community and across the country. We must demand better of ourselves and our university community. I am directing my team to explore best practices for diversity education amongst premier institutions and will work collaboratively with the AVP for Diversity and Inclusion and University Senate to bring it to reality at UND. As of this writing, the students in the photo have not been publicly named.        ",0,1,0
1034,"Mitch McConnell summoned his Republican Conference to a late afternoon meeting on Tuesday with an unusual ask: Would his colleagues support moving forward on a spending deal that doesn’t even exist yet? The answer, surprisingly, was yes. Story Continued Below The Senate voted 89-7 on Tuesday evening to move forward on a bill that eventually will be used to fund the government through Dec. 9 and deliver $1.1 billion to fight the Zika epidemic. A bloc of conservatives voted no, but the measure easily cleared the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster, powered by votes from Senate Democrats, centrist Republicans and GOP senators up for reelection. “We’ve got a lot of work to do around here,” said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who voted “no” because of concerns over the unorthodox process. Yet enough Republicans supported McConnell on the matter because there are still several opportunities to block the bill later if senators believe they are getting a raw deal in the end, senators said. The majority leader offered a brief update on the state of play to his conference, but the main reason for the meeting was to make sure there was enough support to begin a process that eventually will allow Senate Republicans to go home and campaign for reelection more quickly. “There are negotiations that are ongoing, and this bill in my view just sets the stage for an agreement that we hope occurs sooner rather than later,” said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). Campaign finance, trucking safety and the Internet domain system are among the grab bag of issues keeping the Senate from a final deal to stave off a government shutdown at the end of this month. But the biggest hurdle, Zika, has been resolved without including any language that would block Planned Parenthood’s partner clinic in Puerto Rico from accessing the federal grants — a key demand from Democrats. “We want a clean CR, a clean Zika bill, period,” said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat. “We’ll save the debate on the riders for the lame-duck session.” McConnell told reporters the parties were “close” to finalizing an agreement Tuesday afternoon, but he said he he would want senators to have some time to consider it before moving forward. And senior Republicans said the Senate was certain to stay in session next week, ensuring that the annual slog over must-pass government spending would — as in previous years — go down to the wire. Democrats pin the blame for the delay on the GOP. “We should have no vexatious, poison-pill riders,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said. “We are not going to have a CR loaded with riders. One is too many, and that’s what they’re trying to do.” The Nevada Democrat took particular umbrage at the prospect of continuing a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring public companies to disclose political spending. That provision was included in last year’s omnibus spending bill, but Reid said he will fight to strip it out. “We’re not going to have this bill [be] a pincushion for McConnell’s desire to have nothing, nothing reported dealing with campaign spending,” Reid said. Lawmakers also are clashing over the Obama administration’s plan to relinquish the U.S. government’s authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1. Republicans led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune of South Dakota are pushing to continue a prohibition on the handover, which is sharply opposed by the administration. “It’s just trying to figure out how to structure it, how to do it, how to make it effective,” Thune said of the Internet domain issue, known as ICANN. “I think in some form, I think that issue has to be addressed.” Republicans said both the SEC language and the Internet battle were still under consideration as of late Tuesday. Cruz voted “no” on moving forward. A GOP-backed push to block Transportation Department rules regarding how long truckers must rest between drives is among other final issues to be determined. As of late Tuesday afternoon, however, it appeared as though the trucking issue was close to being resolved, according to one source familiar with the negotiations. Congressional negotiators also were continuing to discuss offsets for Zika funding. And it looked increasingly likely that the continuing resolution will not include money to address the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, or to respond to the devastating flooding in Louisiana. “The Democrats are insisting upon Flint, and we’ve got members who are interested in some assistance for flooding in Louisiana,” Thune said. “Maybe it ends up that neither gets addressed — I don’t know.” Thune also suggested that an administration effort to restore the Export-Import Bank’s full financing authority was falling short. “I know that the Dems are very intent on changing that quorum threshold, but even if we could pass it through the Senate — and I don’t know we can — that makes a very heavy lift in the House.” Jennifer Scholtes and Adam Behsudi contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1412,"It has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the War on Terror. While during George W. Bush’s presidency, we had very few terrorist attacks on American soil. But since Barack Obama has been president, that has changed, especially over the last year. There have been shootings and bombings… and yet Obama is refusing to change anything. After welcoming thousands of Muslim refugees from Syria, we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks… yet, Obama has plans to allow over 110,000 more to enter the United States next year. They have to be Muslim, of course, because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do, ever! Well, according to Obama and his fellow liberals, anyway. But that’s exactly what we should be doing, according to KISS front man Gene Simmons. According to him, if we want to win the War on Terror, we need to start profiling everyone… even him! Check out the video below:   “Everyone needs to get smart. I’m okay with profiling,” Simmons declared. “I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, than profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.” But it’s unfair, liberals will certainly cry. Simmons had a response to that, too. “It is unfair,” he said. “That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exist.” It’s kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do. Yes, profiling isn’t “nice.” But being nice doesn’t prevent terrorism. Profiling does — just look at Israel, which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map, yet they’re not only still there, they’re one of the strongest countries in the world. Somehow, profiling works well for them.   Muslims are not all terrorists. We know that. But most terrorists in today’s world are, in fact, Muslims. There is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young Muslim men, for example, to ensure that they don’t have ties to any terrorist organizations like ISIS. If they don’t, then what’s the problem? Liberals complain that profiling violates people’s constitutional rights, yet somehow, they’re perfectly fine with that when it comes to Second Amendment rights. They’re all about gun control, because if it saves even one life, we should do it, even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights. Yet profiling is completely unacceptable? Get real, liberals. You make no sense. ",0,0,1
1223,"On the eve of the first presidential debate, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described her candidate Sunday as “the Babe Ruth of debating,” a glowing assessment that’s unusual at a time when both camps typically work to rein in expectations. “He's a brilliant debater,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Newt Gingrich put it best. The former speaker recently said Donald Trump is the best debater he's ever seen. He's like the Babe Ruth of debating. He really shows up and swings and does a great job.” Story Continued Below Trump has complained that the moderators of the debates may be unfair to him. But Conway said she’s not troubled by any of them, including Monday night’s moderator, NBC's Lester Holt. “He's certainly going to be a good debate moderator tomorrow in that I trust that all of these moderators … for all the debates, including the VP debate next week, will be asking questions that benefit the voter,” she said. And Conway threw cold water on the notion that Gennifer Flowers — who claimed a 12-year affair with Bill Clinton before his presidential bid — would be invited by the campaign to take a front-row seat, a suggestion Trump made on Twitter in response to the Hillary Clinton camp’s invitation of Mark Cuban, a billionaire Trump antagonist. (Flowers told reporters that she would attend the debate.) “She has not been invited by the campaign. She has a right to be there if somebody else gives her a ticket,” Conway said. “But you know, I do think also it shows the poor judgment, a lack of nimbleness of the Clinton campaign that they actually put a statement out last night about Gennifer Flowers being invited, that it shows how easily provoked Donald Trump is, no, you just put out a statement and reminded people who had no — taught people who had no idea who Gennifer Flowers is, that she's the woman who had — said she had a 12-year affair with your husband when he was governor.” Asked why Trump suggested he may invite Flowers, Conway said, “Because he wants to remind people that he's a great counterpuncher.” “They started this one by saying that they would give a front-row seat to Mark Cuban,” she said. GOP vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence, in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" also said Flowers would not be attending the debate.",1,0,0
922,"Hillary Clinton just called out the fact that Donald Trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse – which is absolutely true. Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: “People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.” In fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: “I don’t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff…In fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.” Of course, on one level, Trump wasn’t wrong­­—in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession. This recession most severely impacted low-income folks – people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income – Trump’s response is just “That’s called business.”",0,1,0
191,"A Louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air. This is, sadly, becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair-trigger fingers grows. What makes this story sadly and horrifically unique, though, is that Deputy Derrick Stafford also shot and killed the suspect’s six-year old son. And Stafford is claiming self-defense for that, because of course he is: “Stafford, out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers, began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by [Christopher] Few which would put the officers in imminent danger.” Officers went after Christopher Few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting. They claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down Few, whose six-year old son, Jeremy, was in the front passenger seat. 18 rounds were fired although Few had his hands up, but no firearm was found in the car, and Few and Jeremy were both shot while still in the car. Stafford and his partner, Norris Greenhouse, said that after Few drove forward and then backed up, they were in fear for their lives, so they fired. That’s always the story, though. It makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later, claiming they were in fear for their lives when it’s obvious that their suspects were unarmed, and even had their hands in the air. Reports claim that neither Stafford nor Greenhouse knew Jeremy was in the car when they opened fire. Few was critically wounded, and Jeremy, who was autistic, non-verbal and in a special-needs first-grade class, was murdered. Stafford’s plea of “self-defense” is a huge middle finger to Few and the rest of Jeremy’s grieving family. Arguments will be heard in court next week, where Judge William Bennett will decide whether the indictments stand. ",0,1,0

When Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson went down in pain holding his knee, the news didn’t look good in regards to their star back.  Early reports were that he would just miss a few games at most due to a torn meniscus, but that news has taken a turn for the worst. The star running back is set for surgery on Thursday and will miss three-to-four months with the knee injury.  This puts his time table for December at the earliest and a likely playoff push for the NFC North.

He is holding out hope for a playoff return. https://t.co/SAaCqQlNbF — USA TODAY Sports (@USATODAYsports) September 21, 2016  Peterson has shown over and over that he is a special type of player on the football field and off, so if anyone can come back from this injury sooner than expected, it would be the Vikings soon to be Hall-of-Fame running back.  However, age isn’t on his side and no matter how much you train and get ready for the season, the older you get the more difficult it is to get out there after major injuries. This puts a major clamp on the Vikings hope for the playoffs as they are now down both of their leaders on offense.  Teddy Bridgewater was lost for the year in the preseason as he torn his ACL on a non-contact play in practice. Matt Asiata and Jerrick McKinnon are the likely candidates to take over the running back position for the remainder of the season while Peterson is out as he recovers from his knee surgery.  Both backs are average, but they don’t bring what Peterson brings to the table. You never ask for an injury, but this is football and injuries happen.  With the recent injury to Peterson, this only helps both those other teams in the NFC North and the rest of the conference on making the playoffs.

1109,"A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing. Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said. ""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening. Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami. ""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer."" The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities. Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

367,"Orlando, Florida (CNN)Hillary Clinton faces off against Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time on Monday night, in a crucial prime-time event that could alter the narrative of the presidential election just six weeks out from Election Day. CNN interviewed Clinton supporters in Orlando Wednesday afternoon, at what is expected to be the Democratic nominee's last public campaign event before the first debate. We asked what they think Clinton needs to do to outperform Trump, and what her biggest vulnerability might be under the spotlight. One woman said Clinton should keep her cool if Trump tries to provoke her. Another urged Clinton to stick to what she knows best -- policy. Some Clinton supporters expressed concern that Trump will try to hit her on issues like the email controversy and Benghazi. Here's a look at their advice for the Democratic nominee. Pat Fagan, 73, retired county parks and recreation director who lives in Clermont, Florida What does Clinton need to do at the first debate? ""She needs to continue being herself. I personally think how she handles herself with the public is the only way to go. Getting up there and then calling each other names and so forth -- I don't think that gets you anywhere."" What vulnerability do you think Clinton has at the debate? ""Personally I don't really know of any vulnerabilities she has. I think she's going to win the election by at least 10 points. I think she is going to rip him a new one in the debate."" Patti Fagan, 60, retired, lives in Clermont, Florida What advice do you have for Clinton heading into Monday's debate? ""I would like her to listen to her own heart and not to be afraid of Donald Trump because he's just a punk. I just wish her well and I know he's going to ... anger her, he's going to try to antagonize her. I've seen him when he debates others and he gets really low and I just hope she remains high."" What do you think will be Clinton's biggest vulnerability at the debate? ""Her biggest vulnerability is she overthinks. She's trying to say everything so perfectly and so correctly that I think some people take that as -- they don't trust her, they feel that it's forced. ... Don't overthink it because she's got it right and her instincts are right."" Mary Sharpe, 73, retired, lives in Lady Lake, Florida What does Clinton need to do to have a successful first debate? ""He's a pushover for baiting. I'd love to see her bait him into some crazy discussion. I think his tax returns, get him off on a tangent about his tax returns -- I think that'd be fun."" What do you think will be Clinton's biggest challenge at the debate? ""I think he is probably going to go for the Benghazi thing that they are trying to keep going. I don't think he will bring up the Clinton Foundation because now he's in trouble with his foundation. So I don't think he's going to go there."" Joe Caldwell, 80, Vietnam War veteran from Orlando, Florida What would you like to see Clinton do at the first debate? ""I would really like to see her (discuss) the health care issue, the (Americans with Disabilities Act), the veterans and social issues -- those types of issues because there are so many veterans out there that can't get the care that they need not because they don't know where to go but because it's not available to them and it's pitiful."" What do you think will be Clinton's her biggest vulnerability at the debate? ""I really hate to say this -- I do think that the most serious vulnerability is this thing that they keep bringing up that's history. Like the tapes, like the cell phone issues ... that's history. Let bygones be bygones. Start anew. It's a new day! She can handle it. Oh yes, she can handle it."" David Rucker, 70, retired from the Orange County public schools and lives in Orlando, Florida What do you want to see from Clinton at the debate? ""What I'd like for her to talk about is the police department. I think that needs to get into depth a little bit more to try to get an understanding between the two: the community and the police and sheriff's department. We need to have that camaraderie and we don't ... There are too many young black males getting killed for no reason at all. I realize that they're real nervous sometimes when confronting us but there still has to be a better way."" What do you think is Clinton's biggest weakness? ""I don't know if she's going to have a weakness ... I think she'll come out on top. I'm not worried at all. He's more of a reactionary guy and he'll try to follow Hillary and I think she'll eat him up."" Brittany Arroyo, 27, works at an engineering company and lives in Melbourne, Florida What is Clinton's biggest strength as she head into her first debate against Trump? ""Her biggest strength is her experience and intelligence. Ultimately she knows the most about every political issues especially compared to Donald Trump. Her level of experience just far outweighs almost any other political figure and even if she's not prepared for a question, she'll have plenty of knowledge on it."" What will Clinton's biggest challenge be at the debate? ""Unfortunately, I hate to say it, but as a woman I've seen it. She has to walk this fine line between being cute and likeable but also being tough and wise and intelligent and it's too hard -- you can never win. Even though we'll be watching and we won't care if she smiles, I know a lot of Republicans apparently do."" ",1,0,0
103,"Donald Trump is perhaps the most predictable person who’s ever run for president. If someone disses him, they are enemies for life, and if someone says something positive about the self-proclaimed (we won’t believe it unless he releases his tax returns) billionaire, brutal dictator or not, they will have Trump’s loyalty and respect. Now, things get a little weird when people are sarcastic, as is the case with a Washington Post article that, if you didn’t read it, might be something somewhat positive about the GOP nominee. Trump obviously didn’t read the article. He would have hated it, but he did retweet the article entitled “Donald Trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled”: “Donald Trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled”https://t.co/zvVQnxeiQ9 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016  Most of us, at least those of us who are capable of critical thought, would probably not assume that the article was a positive portrayal of Trump’s birther farce, but, well, we’re talking about Trump. As for the article, no, it was pretty brutal toward Trump. Here are a few snippets: Donald Trump is, at heart, a showman. He rose to national fame thanks to star turns on reality TV in which he played the tough-talking boss to a group of aspirants hoping to become as successful as he has been in business. His great gift is the ability to draw attention — and then use that attention for his own, usually commercial, purposes. Trump might have read that far. He’s proud of being a showman and he’s pretty damned good at it, in much the same way that snake oil salesmen were good at their jobs. Trump may have outdone himself on Friday morning. He and his campaign touted a “major” announcement at his newly opened hotel in Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. The word was that Trump would walk away from his past skepticism about President Obama’s citizenship while also laying the blame for the birther movement at the feet of Hillary Clinton. (That, of course, isn’t true — according to numerous fact-checkers — but no matter: Trump planned to say it anyway.) The article goes on to fact check some of Trump’s many lies, especially in regard to the birther controversy. No, Hillary Clinton didn’t start it and yes, Donald Trump has long been a birther. The Washington Post then went on to describe the event, and it wasn’t flattering. This is how they described Trump’s announcement: Three sentences from Trump himself — one that is totally false and two others that represent a total reversal from a position he held as recently as, well, Thursday night. Clearly, Trump didn’t read the article, which is a little frightening. Presidents are given several pages, if not hundreds, of important documents ever single day. It’s critical that our President read and not just assume and retweet. ",0,1,0

As she has before, Clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart ISIL’s efforts to inspire terror, but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith. But the only way to gather such intelligence, King said, is to step up surveillance. “So listen, it's not going to be the handshake of a friendship that's going to bring Muslim Americans outside,” King said. “To get more intelligence, you have to do that by surveillance, by undercovers. That’s what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime, whether it's the Westies and the Irish, whether it’s the Italians and the mafia, that's how you do it. We shouldn't be pandering to political correctness.""",1,0,0
882,"The Hagerstown Police Department is under heavy fire after a video went viral of officers spraying pepper spray into the back of a police cruiser where a biracial teenage girl was handcuffed, according to Herald-Mail Media. The 15-year-old girl was struck by a car on Sunday while riding her bike, after which she hit her head and passed out for half a minute. Ambulances were called, but the girl said she didn’t want to go to a hospital. Police officers grabbed her off her bike as she tried to ride away and slammed her face into a nearby windowsill, eventually cuffing her hands. Panicked, the girl resisted officers as they attempted to push her into the back of the cruiser. She can be heard in the video repeatedly requesting for the presence of a black officer named “Zach.” “All we want to do is make sure she’s OK,” one officer tells a bystander, explaining that the girl might have lingering brain damage from the collision. Not even a minute later, an officer can be heard telling the girl to “put your feet in the car, OK, or you’re going to get sprayed.” When the frightened girl does not immediately comply, the officers close the door and then spray out their canisters into a crack in the window. The girl can then be heard shrieking in pain, saying “I can’t breathe” multiple times. Hagerstown Police Capt. Tom Langston only said on Wednesday that the department is still investigating. “We’re reviewing the body camera footage,” he said. Police have since charged the girl with failure to obey a traffic device, possession of marijuana, two counts of second-degree assault, and disorderly conduct. The girl is reportedly on the honor roll at school and before this incident has never had a criminal record. “The only treatment she got (from police) was slamming, abuse and Mace,” said the girl’s family attorney, Robin Ficker. According to Ficker, the pepper spray was not flushed out of her eyes for over three hours, and police requested that hospital staff refrain from taking pictures of her injuries during her stay. The full video of the pepper spraying incident can be found here: Posted by Robin Ficker Law Offices on Tuesday, September 20, 2016      ",0,1,0
1424,"President Barack Obama has given what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. General Assembly, and it was a defeatist doozy on the inadequacy of military power in the struggle against Islamist extremism in Syria and elsewhere. By extension, since the U.S. is the world’s preeminent military power, that would mean our president essentially said we can’t win. Noting the longstanding buildup of militant forces within Islam that have fueled the Islamic State group, Obama cast doubt on the viability of a military solution, The Daily Caller reported. “If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,” Obama said. The president said we must “be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.” While he granted that this process would have a military component, he also referred to “a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.” Obama recommended that we “pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.” You can watch here; the relevant portion of the video begins at 29:30.  We could be forgiven for wondering how any of this is supposed to work if we are led by liberal politicians who are reluctant to admit the often-obvious link between violence and radical Islam and who are more likely to criticize Christians than jihadists. We also wonder how any of this is supposed to work if we are led by liberal politicians who have so conspicuously failed to “see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.” It’s not going to work as long we call the good guys deplorable and the bad guys a religion of peace. Think about it between now and November. You’ll know what to do. Share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think of Obama’s remarks to the U.N.

1147,"Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Thursday said that the release of video footage from the killing by police of Keith Lamont Scott might ease tensions in Charlotte, North Carolina. “If we had a body camera on the officer, there is no question that we would have greater clarity going forward to what actually happened,” he said in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. Story Continued Below ""I'm not a law enforcement officer, so I'm not going to pretend to understand their concept of releasing the video,"" Scott said. ""We've seen different agencies do it in different times. The release of the video can help defuse some of the tensions if the video is helpful."" ""The faster the information comes to the surface, the quicker we get clarity, hopefully there will be a calming influence,"" Scott added. ""But there is never a reason for violence in response to a situation. Violence for violence only begets more violence. This is the wrong direction and the wrong path.” Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police outside his apartment complex in Charlotte, North Carolina. Police were pursuing an arrest warrant for another person when they encountered Scott, who was African American, in his car. The Charlotte police chief says Scott was armed with a handgun, while his family denies it. “As far as we know, at this point in time, no, he did not own a gun,” said Justin Bamberg, one of the Scott family’s attorneys. “Our direct response is this: That is what the chief says. I haven't seen any evidence -- none of you all have seen any evidence that a gun was there. That is what people are saying,” he said when asked to respond to the chief’s statements asserting Scott’s possession of a handgun. “It's my understanding that his wife saw him get shot and killed. And that's something that she will never, ever forget,” Bamberg said. When asked whether the family wants the video released, he replied, “Ultimately what I think the whole community here wants is the truth. And to the extent that release of the video can somehow help us reach that truth, I think that the family will ultimately support its release.” The family was supposed to address the press conference with their attorneys, but were absent due to grieving, according to Bamberg. He said, “Let me be very clear. This family does not agree with rioting or innocent individuals being injured or killed. But they do support citizens and their right to voice their frustration, to voice their anger.” Correction: This article originally said that Senator Scott urged the Charlotte police to release the video. He merely said that release of the video might ease tensions.",1,0,0
366,"(CNN)Even if their preferred candidate wins, a new poll released Wednesday found that supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will feel more relief than excitement. The findings from the Pew Research Center revealed widespread disenchantment toward this year's presidential contest among American voters. Majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). Those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. Only 25% of Clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. There was little more enthusiasm among Trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the GOP nominee triumphs in November. But many more Clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. Ditto for Trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. According to Pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if Trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious. The race between Clinton and Trump represents a battle between two of the least liked major party candidates in history, and Pew's findings are hardly the first to show that voters are largely disappointed with both. A Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found Clinton and Trump to be the two most unpopular presidential candidates in decades. The Pew Research Center report is based on a random sample of 3,941 registered voters who are members of the Center's American Trends Panel. Respondents took the survey between August 16 and September 12 online or by mail, and were originally recruited via nationally representative telephone surveys. Results among registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 2.6 percentage points. ",1,0,0

1549,"In another revelation from WikiLeaks we find even more information! Hillary has accepted donations from the head of a company who has also accepted donations from ISIS…good gosh, just when you think this vile woman couldn’t get any worse!   The company is French industrial giant Lefarge, from which Hillary accepted over $100,000.  Let us also not forget this:  What is also shocking is that the City of Paris signed contracts with this company, despite information linking them to the Islamic State. TheCanary.Co reported on this shocking discovery: Documents obtained by several journalistic investigations reveal that Lafarge has paid taxes to the terror group to operate its cement plant in Syria, and even bought Isis oil for years. Yet according to the campaign group, SumOfUs, Lafarge is the corporate partner and sand provider to the City of Paris for this summer’s Paris-Plages urban beach event. The project run by Office of the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, will create artificial beaches along the river Seine in the centre and northeast of Paris. Lafarge also has close ties to Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s, and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s. During her connection to Lafarge, the firm was implicated in facilitating a CIA-backed covert arms export network to Saddam Hussein. The report went on to confirm that the company’s Paris office was well aware of the operations conducted with the Islamic State for cement and oil transactions. Lafarge bought oil for its own operations, but also allegedly supplied the Islamic State with cement for its operations. You can’t sit on the fence with a terrorist organization, you’re either with them, or you’re not. You can’t have a middle ground because if you try to they will OBLITERATE YOU. You don’t mess around with terrorists unless you are in clear support of them.

1043,"Eighteen months ago, three junior senators attempted something their chamber had never considered, much less accomplished—starting to roll back the long-entrenched federal ban on marijuana. Though all first-termers, the senators—Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rand Paul of Kentucky—knew enough about the difficulties of marijuana politics to avoid any mention of full-scale legalization. They tailored the bill to focus narrowly on medical marijuana and the half-dozen stumbling blocks in federal law that have made it so difficult for Americans to get safe access to the increasingly popular drug. Story Continued Below They branded their bill with a clever acronym: the CARERS Act, for the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States Act of 2015, which, if passed, would do a number of sensible things: reclassify marijuana so that it is considered to have some medical value; permit banks to handle money from legal marijuana businesses; prevent the government from interfering with state-legal medical marijuana programs; exclude non-psychoactive marijuana extracts from the definition of marijuana; grant military veterans access to medical marijuana; and break the government’s monopoly on medical marijuana research. To no one’s surprise, the bill went absolutely nowhere. But it didn’t die. Despite being ignored by leadership, it managed to collect 16 cosponsors by the end of 2015, a laundry list of mostly Democrats, two Republicans and an independent. Then, early this year, a 17th name was added, and a surprising one at that: Lindsey Graham. The senior senator from South Carolina, an establishment Republican if ever there was one, a foreign policy hawk who ran for president this cycle in large part because he perceived Rand Paul’s isolationism as a threat to national security, Lindsey Graham—who represents a state that doesn’t even allow medical marijuana—has become one of the unlikeliest and potentially most influential of the bill’s backers because he is unique among the bill's cosponsors (now at 20), as he’s the only one with a gavel. And unlike his colleagues among Republican leadership, Graham is using his authority to move the marijuana bill forward. In mid-July, he chaired a Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the pros and cons of changing the way the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies marijuana like it was heroin. Over the 4&frac12; decades of the war on drugs, there have been plenty of hearings on the dangers of marijuana, but before July 13 there had never been a hearing on marijuana's medical benefits. “If there was one, I don't know about it,” Graham told POLITICO Magazine. The emergence of Graham as an honest broker of information on this issue reflects rapidly shifting attitudes among conservative Americans. Opposition to marijuana legalization among Republicans has withered from 60 percent in December 2014 to 42 percent in July 2016, while the percentage of Republicans in favor of legalizing pot has grown from 28 percent to 45 percent over the same period. But Graham does more than just add a prominent voice. His decision to chair a hearing was a critical step (though no guarantee) toward getting a vote on the CARERS Act in the full Judiciary Committee, the only avenue by which it can reach the Senate floor. Graham, he is at pains to point out, rejects marijuana for recreational use, but he told POLITICO Magazine, “I am open-minded to the idea that the plant may have medical attributes that could help people.…I'm convinced that we should, as a nation, research the medical applications of the marijuana plant....It could be life-changing. I just want to do it in a scientific way…and the current system doesn't allow for the research that we need.” *** We’ve seen this before, when public opinion swings suddenly on a divisive cultural issue and yanks lawmakers along by the arm. It happened with gay marriage, and the impetus of the change is always personal experience. Graham’s conversion has been no different. “I have several people that I personally know who have children who have some epilepsy and other diseases,” Graham told POLITICO, “and the parents seem to think this helps. And…what stuns me is how little we know and how much more we could know. Some of these [diseases], like epilepsy, the families tell us that it has changed the child's life. That’s why I want more research. Is that anecdotal, or is it real? To me, that's very exciting.” Parents of children with epilepsy have become the most effective advocates for marijuana law reform at every level. Consequently, in a very short time frame, laws legalizing cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant, have passed in 16 states, mostly in the south and southeast: Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and, yes, South Carolina. The problem is that most of these laws provide little access to actual CBD because marijuana is still classified as a highly addictive drug with no medical benefit. So the state laws, in some cases, have made matters worse by providing false hope for the parents of sick children, a problem the CARERS Act aims to solve. “When you ask if it is still illegal under federal law, it’s almost a trick question,” said Jill Swing, a South Carolina resident and mother of a child affected by a disease that is treatable with CBD. “Currently the federal government is in conflict with itself. The Federal Farming Act of 2014 allows for cultivation of hemp….That being said, all forms of cannabis, including hemp, are considered Schedule I controlled substances by the DEA. That is why the CBD component of the CARERS Act is so important.” It’s parents like Swing who helped educate Graham on the importance of CBD, and legalizing CBD has become sort of an entry-level course for former drug warriors who are now inching toward drug policy reform. Even Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and longtime bête noire of marijuana advocates, made an appearance at Graham’s subcommittee hearing in July to express his support for legalizing CBD. But he made sure to limit his support to juvenile epileptics and “children who suffer from these rare conditions.” In essence, he was acknowledging the medical benefit of marijuana but reserving the right to determine which sick people deserve access to that medicine. Graham’s open-mindedness on the issue goes back to an experience with his own mother, whose death he wrote about in an autobiography he released in the run-up to his presidential campaign. In My Story, a 126-page e-book available on his website, Graham relates in gripping detail his mother Millie’s battle with stage IV Hodgkin’s lymphoma, her quick wasting, how the doctors pronounced her dead, and how Lindsey rushed to her bedside and revived her, if only for a few days. His mother, 56, told him, ""Lindsey, let me go.” After a week, during which the 21-year-old college student witnessed his mother convulse with seizures, Graham, fighting back tears, told his mother: “Okay, let go. We’ll be fine. Let go.” “She smiled at me,” Graham wrote, “and died five minutes later.” The book never delves into whether marijuana might have helped his mother (she died in 1976, decades before the debate would emerge so publicly), but the anecdote is just the kind of experience that could cause even a lobbyist-besieged senator to empathize with cancer survivors evangelizing the benefits of medical marijuana. So, I asked Graham if that’s what happened with him. “Absolutely,” he said, without hesitation. “I mean, chemotherapy—they kill you to make you better. And people who go through chemo treatment go through hell. If there's an application of the marijuana plant that can help patients like that? I know they need all the help they can get. I just want to make sure we do it based on science, but that is a worthy goal....Sign me up.” *** But Graham’s votes haven’t always matched his thinking on the issue. It took some gentle nudging from Don Murphy, director of conservative outreach for the Marijuana Policy Project, to get Graham’s votes to reflect his rhetoric. It was the morning of June 11, 2015, when Murphy said he caught Graham in the hallway before Graham went into a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee to vote. Graham asked Murphy, “How you doing?” And Murphy seized the opening. “Well, that depends on how you vote on my amendment.” “Well, what amendment is that?” “It’s the medical marijuana amendment,” Murphy recalls telling Graham, “and I’ve read that you’ve made certain positive statements about the states making these decisions and patients making these decisions, and I hope your vote reflects your previous statements.” Indeed, in February 2014, Graham had told WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina: “…when it comes to medicinal marijuana and this [CBD] oil, I think politicians should embrace what makes sense….This is about families with sick children.” In effect, Graham was making favorable statements for more than a year before Murphy grabbed him in the hallway. He just wasn’t voting that way. Murphy reminded him of this, he said, eliciting polite nods from Graham as the senator clutched the doorknob of the committee room before disappearing inside. Murphy’s amendment, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), aimed at restricting federal law enforcement from meddling with state-legal medical marijuana programs. It passed the Senate Appropriations Committee that day by a vote of 21-9, with eight Republicans in favor. At the end of the meeting, Murphy was ecstatic, shaking hands and thanking members, but then he was disappointed to see that Graham had voted no by proxy. Later that day, while roaming the halls on the second floor of the Russell Office Building, Murphy said he just happened to bump into Graham and a staffer as they left his office. Graham was holding a laundered shirt on a hanger, which impressed Murphy because Graham hadn’t delegated that chore to his staffer. “How you doing?” Graham asked Murphy, recognizing him from earlier. “Well, I’d be doing better if, you know, I thought I’d get your vote.” “What do you mean?” Graham said. “You voted no by proxy."" Graham looked at his staffer and said, “I did?” And the staffer said, “Yeah, you did.” In long committee meetings, it's not uncommon for a member to step out for a few minutes and for a staffer seated behind the member to indicate with a head nod to the chair how the member intended to vote for a particular amendment. In this case, Graham's staffer guessed incorrectly. “What!?” Graham said. “I didn’t want to do that!” And right there, Graham pulled out his flip phone and called the clerk to change his vote, but it was too late. From that moment on, Graham was thinking about the issue in a new way. About six months later, Murphy was in New Hampshire lobbying presidential candidates for the Marijuana Policy Project and he bumped into Graham at a Jeb Bush rally, just a few weeks after Graham had suspended his own campaign. Graham came up to Murphy and told him, “I’m on that bill!”—meaning the CARERS Act, which caught Murphy off-guard because it’s his job to know these things. He went back to his hotel that night and looked it up on his laptop and didn’t see Graham’s name listed as a co-sponsor, so the next day he hunted Graham down and found him at another Jeb rally. “Senator, respectfully, I don’t see your name on there,” Murphy said. “It’s on there! I promise you, it’s on there!” Graham insisted. For whatever bureaucratic reason, Graham’s name wasn’t officially added to the co-sponsor list until March 10, a month after the New Hampshire primary. *** On July 13, 6&frac12; months after Graham withdrew from the presidential race and six months after he saw Don Murphy in New Hampshire, Graham chaired the Senate’s first-ever hearing on medical marijuana. Murphy was sitting in the gallery. About an hour into the hearing, Graham shuffled through his papers, found what he was looking for, and holding it up, he said, “I don’t mean to advertise for this guy, but Dr. Reefer—”displaying a photo of a pot leaf-emblazoned billboard for a Las Vegas-area business that provides medical marijuana cards to qualifying residents. “He has a billboard. I think this is in Las Vegas,"" Graham said, eliciting enough laughs from the gallery to wake the room up. Graham entered Dr. Reefer into the record to demonstrate that some states’ medical marijuana programs “have not gone down the scientific route,” and he called Dr. Reefer a prime example of a bad actor using medical marijuana as a fig leaf to cover, in Graham’s words, “de facto backdoor legalization” of marijuana for recreational use. For Graham, the medical marijuana issue is a spectrum: On one end are the juvenile epileptics who need CBD, who he supports without reservation, and on the other end is Dr. Reefer, an operation that Graham sees as making a mockery of medical marijuana in order to legitimize criminal activity. During his hearing, practically in real time, it appeared Graham was trying to determine where along that spectrum he felt comfortable landing. Graham was introduced to the problem of Dr. Reefer by Miriam Adelson, a medical doctor and an addiction researcher who is also the wife of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. “They said, 'This is not what you want,’” Graham tells POLITICO Magazine. “And I got a bunch of stuff from California, too. But the Dr. Reefer was just too easy, so I chose him.” A lawmaker looking for clarity on this issue isn’t likely to get much help from the Adelsons, who have taken seemingly contradictory positions on medical marijuana. The Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation studies medical marijuana in its facility in Tel Aviv, but just two years ago, in 2014, Sheldon Adelson, one of the most prolific donors to conservative causes, gave the anti-medical marijuana campaign in Florida $5.5 million. The Las Vegas Review Journal flipped its editorial position on marijuana from pro to con after Adelson purchased the newspaper. In September, the Adelsons reinforced their commitment to fight medical marijuana with an additional $1 million to fight legalization in Florida. “The Adelsons are strong opponents of medical marijuana,” says Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment from POLITICO Magazine. Craig Moon, publisher of the Review Journal , replied in an email, “the editorial board reports to me, I believe that Nevadans should vote no on the recreational marijuana amendment. The Adelson family also shares my view.” Dr. Reefer is not a real person; it’s a business that doesn’t grow or sell any marijuana. Since it opened in 2001, it charges patients a fee and provides them with a medical card that allows them to purchase marijuana legally at separate establishments. It was founded by a three-time felon who ran afoul of federal authorities in 2010, when he was caught overstepping the bounds of Dr. Reefer’s business model by selling marijuana directly to clients. Dr. Reefer continues its busy referral business with its provocative brand name under new ownership (whose identities are difficult to determine). “As for the billboards, it’s nothing new,” says Derek Sante, spokesman for Dr. Reefer. “Those billboards have been up for more than a decade.” Although advocates like Don Murphy have no love for the Adelsons (“It’s heartless to support making criminals out of cancer patients, and that's what Adelsons' position does”), Murphy concedes that operations like Dr. Reefer remain an obstacle to his work. “Look, he’s not wrong,” Murphy said, referring to Graham. “The nonsense that went on in California for years has made it very difficult for those of us who are advocating for legitimate medical marijuana patients.” But Murphy goes on to connect the dots between bad state law and a paralyzed Congress: “California happens because legislators don’t do their jobs.” “So, anyway,” Murphy said, bringing it back around to the CARERS Act hearing in July. “I’m real happy with Lindsey Graham.” Like many activists who sat through Graham’s historic Senate hearing, Murphy left that day feeling like Graham meant business. “I do mean business,” Graham told POLITICO Magazine. “Sen. Graham has gone above and beyond,” says Murphy. “He just didn’t put his name on it [the CARERS Act], he actually held a hearing. And I give him major props for that, and the hearing was pretty fair.” “What we're doing today is not enough,” Graham said of the federal drug-law status quo. “We need to do more, and I just want to make sure that what we do doesn't get us to legitimizing the Dr. Reefers of the world.” On August 11, the DEA refused to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to the less-severe Schedule II, as the CARERS bill would do, but did promise to accept applications for licensed growing operations in order to improve access to research-quality marijuana. It didn’t indicate how many applications it would approve. (Graham has not responded to requests for comment regarding the DEA’s decision.) Unless something changes in the lame-duck session, the likelihood the CARERS Act gets a vote in this Congress remains close to zero; the fight over Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland is all the Senate Judiciary Committee is focused on. While the CARERS Act's progress is historic, it's still just a marijuana bill on Capitol Hill. And the lame-duck session could indeed follow a landslide of state-level marijuana victories that could rattle even the most steadfast drug-war loyalist. Medical marijuana will be on the ballot in Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota, while full Colorado-style legalization will be on the ballot in California, Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada, where voters could render Dr. Reefer and his ""de facto legalization"" scheme beside the point. But Don Murphy of MPP is having a field day with it. He tells all the Republican lawmakers in states where it's on the ballot: ""I bet you marijuana gets more votes than you do.""",1,0,0
1040,"Outgoing Rep. Tim Huelskamp is angry that he lost his primary — and he wants everyone in the House of Representatives to know it. The ultra-conservative Kansas Republican took to the floor late Tuesday afternoon to force roll call votes on a series of what leadership thought were noncontroversial bills being offered up by voice vote. He objected to 17 of the bills, blocking them from being passed by a simple voice vote Tuesday evening. Story Continued Below Since his objections meant the House would be required to hold roll calls on all of them, a tedious process which could take two or three hours, leaders were forced to postpone all but three of the measures into Wednesday. Huelskamp's latest move comes just a few days after he threatened to force a vote on the impeachment of the IRS commissioner, despite the fact that Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) struck a deal with Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) to postpone the vote until after the election. Republicans, including some of his own friends, have noted that he’s become something of a loose canon since returning to Washington after being defeated in his primary in August. “So much for all of Mr. Huelskamp’s rhetoric about the need for lame duck members to go quietly into the night,” said one GOP official. To be fair, however, a number of House Freedom Caucus members and the Heritage Foundation also had objections to several proposals. His office also noted that ""a quick review appears to indicate that this is the largest number of suspensions in one day for the entire 2015-2016 Congressional calendar."" ""Americans deserve better than for Congressional leaders to decide late on a Friday to suddenly place 49 bills on the calendar,"" his office wrote POLITICO in an email. ""With no clear, public criteria for selection of these bills from among thousands of others, Americans at least deserve the transparency of knowing how their Member of Congress votes on these bills."" Establishment-aligned outside groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Joe Rickett’s “Ending Spending” group poured more than a million into Huelskamp’s race to defeat him. They said he was ineffective because he voted against everything, and argued his poor relationships in Washington got him kicked off the Agriculture Committee, a prized spot for his district. Huelskamp blames House GOP leadership for not coming to his rescue. In recent days he’s openly criticized Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Some members groused privately that Huelskamp looked all too happy to scuttle the floor schedule Tuesday evening. He sat in the back row of the House chamber, avoiding the C-SPAN cameras but asking for roll calls on bills. Usually lawmakers go down to the desk — in full view of the cameras — to request the yeas and nays. Meanwhile, around the capitol, one of the biggest questions driving Tuesday chatter was whether he would force the IRS impeachment issue later this week.",1,0,0
1301,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. — Score round 1 for Hillary Clinton. That’s according to The POLITICO Caucus — a panel of swing-state activists, strategists and operatives who watched the first debate here Monday night. The insiders’ bipartisan verdict: Clinton dispatched Donald Trump in their first of three nationally televised meetings. Story Continued Below Overall, roughly 80 percent of insiders — with equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans responding to the post-debate survey — said Clinton did the better job at the debate, including 99 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans. Only 21 percent — 1 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans — picked Trump as the winner. Democrats said Clinton was prepared and succeeded in provoking Trump — who began the debate speaking so quietly the audio engineers struggled to raise his volume to a comparable level in the debate hall but quickly became more animated in the face of Clinton’s attacks. “No contest,” said an Iowa Democrat — who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. “Trump held it together for 16 minutes and fell apart.” “Trump melted down,” added a Florida Democrat. “This is bad for him. [It] confirms all the worries of swing voters.” Some Democrats predicted the debate would swing the momentum, which appeared to be with Trump, with public polls showing a tightening race. “Donald Trump exposed himself to be a clown,” added a New Hampshire Democrat, who also predicted “the polls will show dramatic movement in next 24 hours.” But a Florida Democrat countered that Clinton’s performance was unlikely to change fundamentally the trajectory of the race. “It is becoming a base turnout election, and she did a great job tonight of making the stakes in this election very clear,” the Democrat said. Among Republicans, the tally was closer — but that speaks to a divided party as much as actual ambivalence about which candidate performed better on Monday night. “Trump was an embarrassment,” an Iowa Republican said. “I'd hate to be the guy in the spin room lying about how Trump won the debate.” “It wasn't close,” a Virginia Republican added. “Sure, our tribal politics will force it to seem somewhat close, but even the most committed of Trump supporters know, deep down, that did not go well.” But there was a significant share of Republicans who thought Trump won — most of whom said Trump’s outside appeal could be the most memorable aspect of the debate. “Hillary Clinton sounded like every politician has sounded for the last half century. Donald Trump did not,” said an Ohio Republican. “This year that may just be enough.” “Neither candidate earned a single undecided vote,” a Nevada Republican added. “Clinton supporters will think she won. Trump supporters will think he won. Trump gets the nod because he did not completely implode.” Here are two other takeaways from the first debate: Clinton met expectations on Monday night, while insiders are mixed on Trump. The vast majority of all insiders, 88 percent, said Clinton met expectations going into Monday night. That includes nearly three-quarters of Republicans: One Florida Republican called Clinton “calm in the face of an insane person.” Insiders were more mixed on Trump, on the other hand. Overall, 55 percent of insiders said Trump met expectations: 40 percent of Democrats and 68 percent of Republicans. “There were no expectations,” said an Iowa Republican. “He got off to a great start, appeared reserved, but then he took the bait. The sneers and reactions when Clinton was speaking undercut his first impression.” But for some Republicans, meeting expectations wasn’t good enough. The expectations “were low,” said one Pennsylvania Republican. “He needed to exceed [them], and he didn't.” And a Virginia Republican said Trump did little to appeal to a key group of Republican-leaning voters whom Trump is repelling this year: white-collar whites. “He needs college whites, and he didn't connect,” the Republican said. Republicans are divided on the political impact of the debate. GOP insiders aren’t sure whether Trump is better or worse off after the Monday night debate. Asked whether Trump’s performance makes it more likely he wins the race, just 31 percent said yes — comparable to the 33 percent who said it doesn’t. A slim plurality, 36 percent, said the debate wouldn’t have a significant impact on Trump’s chances. The debate was “not fatal, but very definitely a missed opportunity,” said one New Hampshire Republican. ""Neither of them made a persuasive case that they were more fit than the other to be president. At this point that advantages Trump,"" said an Ohio Republican. “Put plainly: he failed the presidential test,” a Virginia Republican added. “And hiding out on Fox News isn't going to fix it for him.” But despite — or perhaps because of — Trump’s unconventional debate style, some insiders said his message could resonate more than the pundits think in the immediate wake of the debate. “He spoke in a language that normal Americans understand,” a Virginia Republican said. “America is looking for something different,” a Colorado Republican added. “He is very different.” And some Republicans cautioned against reading too much into the first match-up. “There are two more debates to watch,” said a Virginia Republican. “Trump has more he can adjust, [while] Hillary is a fixed quantity as a virtual 30-year political incumbent. Trump will be more aggressive in the next two debates.” Among Democrats, it was more decisive: 60 percent said the debate made it less likely Trump becomes president, compared to 15 percent who said it makes it more likely and 25 percent who said it wouldn’t have an impact. “Trump wasn't presidential,” a Colorado Democrat said. “He needed to show restraint, and he failed. Tonight was his opportunity to show the country how he would govern, and he missed the opportunity.” These are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey: Colorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer Florida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

209,"Through the course of this election season, a dark cloud has hung over Trump’s campaign – OK, many dark clouds. Dark, racist, xenophobic, lying clouds. But the one we’re referencing here is “what the hell is going on with his taxes?” The simple answer, as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate, is that The Donald simply hasn’t paid any federal income tax. Trump blamed Clinton for “squandering” taxpayer dollars, thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements — the kind Republicans like Trump typically vote against. Clinton, of course, took the opportunity to get in a dig about the GOP nominee’s own taxes. “Maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years,” Clinton shot back, expertly placing the bait in the trap. And, of course, she didn’t have to wait long for Trump to try to grab the cheese. To emphasize his point, he accidentally admitted that she’s exactly right: “It would be squandered too, believe me.” Pay attention to the word “would.” Trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes, which he called “smart” earlier in the debate. Is this the reason he doesn’t want to reveal his taxes, which he says he will release “against his lawyer’s wishes” if Clinton releases deleted emails? Does Trump not want the voting public to know that he’s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share? When Trump says “believe me,” believe him — not that his tax dollars would be “squandered” but that he believes they “would” if he had paid any.

536,"Washington (CNN)Russia might be behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee, according to US officials and lawmakers -- but not Donald Trump. The Republican presidential nominee came up with many alternative possibilities at the first general election debate on Monday night. ""It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people,"" he said during the first presidential debate. ""It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."" He also devoted a portion of his answer about cyberattacks to the precociousness of his 10-year-old son. ""So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable,"" he said. CNN's Reality Check vets the claims of the debate Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said maybe Trump is confused about where the hacker's ""bed"" lies. ""My guess is if this guy weighs 400 pounds he's sitting somewhere in Russia right now,"" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" Tuesday. ""I just find this, like his statements about ISIS that played into Russian propaganda, really deplorable."" And cyber experts say the remarks seem unaware of the seriousness of the threat. ""I was pretty surprised during the debate -- there is no ambiguity here,"" former Obama administration cybersecurity official Chris Finan said. ""Everybody knows who did it. So to suggest it was an individual -- and the other thing is -- these intrusion sets are fairly sophisticated,"" said Finan, now CEO at Manifold Technology. ""To say it was an individual or lone actor or small group, that to me shows a lack of appreciation about the threat and how sophisticated and pernicious it is."" So how on-target was Trump with his cybersecurity comments? Here are some expert perspectives. Could a 400-pound hacker have pulled the DNC breach off? The short answer is no, said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that investigated and responded to the hack of the DNC. It's nearly impossible to know any hacker's weight. But one thing that is clear to experts like Alperovitch is that government-backed hackers are well-staffed and well-resourced, using very particular software, break-in tactics and cover-up techniques that act as a signature of each group. DNC hack: What you need to know In the case of the DNC, CrowdStrike discovered two groups inside the system, working unbeknownst to the other, which are well-known as Russian-linked hacking operations and have breached dozens or even hundreds of high-value targets like government agencies, high-level officials' offices and think tanks. Alperovitch said it was ""pretty unlikely"" an individual could have mimicked all the various ways that these groups are distinct, from the software to the ""tradecraft."" Let alone the other targets bearing the same signatures. There has been some official talk of Russian involvement, hasn't there? US officials have only pointed at Russia anonymously, not wanting to ruffle the delicate Moscow-Washington relationship at this point.o But US officials from President Barack Obama on down have warned about Russia efforts to interfere in the election through hacking. Two arrested for hacking US officials Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has been one of the more forward-leaning. ""They see a US conspiracy behind every bush,"" Clapper said a few weeks ago when asked if the Russians wanted to disrupt the presidential vote. ""They believe that we are trying to influence political developments in Russia, and so their natural response is to retaliate."" Could an individual hacker still do damage? Most definitely. Beyond Russia and other nation-state attackers and financially motivated criminal operators, often organized in mafia-like gangs, there are also lone-wolf hackers. Experts divide them into categories like ""hacktivists"" and ""script kiddies,"" opportunistic hackers motivated by notoriety or fame. Examples include Guccifer, a now-convicted Romanian hacker who recently pleaded guilty to hacking the accounts of the family of President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Lawmakers say Russia behind hacks (A character claiming credit for the DNC hack surfaced online going by ""Guccifer 2.0,"" but Alperovitch said that was just an attempt to divert suspicion from the Russians as the Guccifer redux"" has been proven to not natively speak Romanian."") In another case, two North Carolina men were arrested for allegedly breaking into the email accounts of CIA Director John Brennan and National Intelligence Director James Clapper. How do individuals go about their hacking? While carrying out an attack the level of the DNC hack requires skill and manpower that individuals don't possess, attacks like breaking a few email accounts is within the realm of a single hacker. Often the perpetrators use what's known as social engineering -- gathering clues about a person from their public life online and then using it to guess passwords or security questions to get into accounts and release the contents online. But that's still probably beyond the abilities of most 10-year-olds. ",1,0,0

431,"(CNN)Donald Trump is expanding the list of individuals he would consider naming to the Supreme Court, just days before the first presidential debate, in what appears to be his latest effort to shore up Republican and minority support. Trump's latest additions put a sitting Republican senator who isn't supporting Trump and three non-white judges onto Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees, bringing the list to 21 names from the previous 10. The list, which Trump is set to release later Friday, includes: Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, US Court of Appeals Judge Margaret Ryan, Iowa Supreme Court Justice Edward Mansfield, George Supreme Court Justice Keith Blackwell, Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles Candy, US Court of Appeals Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich, US District Court Judge Amul Thapar, US District Court Judge Federico Moreno and Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Young. A Trump campaign aide confirmed the list, which was first reported Friday morning by NBC News. The unusual move to release a list, rather than simply naming the kinds of justices he would seek to nominate, as nearly all presidential nominees, including his rival Hillary Clinton, have done, is part of his efforts to reassure conservatives in his candidacy. Trump has repeatedly reminded conservatives wary of his candidacy of the importance of the President's power to fill Supreme Court vacancies in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia's death earlier this year and as two justices on the bench are now over 80 years old. Trump's latest additions appear to be continuing reassurance to conservatives. ""Donald Trump continues to take unprecedented steps to demonstrate that he intends to appoint justices like Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Conservatives should be very pleased by the steps he has taken, and if he lives up to his promises we will have a Court that truly puts the rule of law ahead of political preferences,"" said Carrie Severino, of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. Mike Lee: thanks, but no thanks Trump's pick of Lee, the Utah senator who is one of the last remaining Trump holdouts among Senate Republicans, appears to be a bid to gain not just Lee's support but also that of Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who fought Trump for the GOP nomination until May and refused to endorse him during his speech at the Republican National Convention in July. Cruz has continued to resist entreaties to endorse the Republican nominee, but he did meet last week with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump's running mate. Cruz's spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment. Lee, meanwhile, isn't biting. ""Sen. Lee already has the job he wants which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of Utah again this year. This new list does not change Sen. Lee's mind about Trump in any way whatsoever,"" Lee spokesman Conn Caroll said in a statement. Lee's brother, an associate justice on the Utah Supreme Court, was listed in Trump's initial batch of 11 potential Supreme Court picks. Previous list was all-white Trump's list also brings diversity to his previous all-white cast of potential Supreme Court picks, just as Trump has ramped up his efforts in the last month to appeal to minority voters -- many of whom he has offended during his presidential campaign. Thapar, a US district court judge, was the first South Asian to be named to an Article III federal judgeship in 2007. Moreno, who serves on the district court for the southern district of Florida, is Hispanic and was born in Venezuela. And Robert Young, the Michigan supreme court's chief justice, is African-American. Trump also added a military veteran to his list by naming Ryan, a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, as another potential pick. ",1,0,0
1357,"In front of the largest televised debate audience ever, Donald Trump blew it. Swing-state Republicans expressed frustration at his Monday night performance, characterizing it as a series of missed opportunities to move the dial in the places that will matter most to his electoral fortunes in November. Story Continued Below Name-checking battleground states like Michigan and Ohio was a wise move, state and local GOP leaders said. And Trump’s message on trade resonates in industrial areas across the Rust Belt, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. But above all else, Republican officials and operatives lamented his lack of preparation and failure to reach persuadable voters, especially women and GOP-leaners who are not yet sold on him. Instead of prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton — which would have helped accelerate the consolidation of the GOP base in states like Pennsylvania where once-reticent Republicans are beginning to fall in line behind the nominee — Trump got bogged down defending controversial decisions he’s made, from championing birtherism to making insensitive comments about women. “I think Trump should have been better prepared,” said Alan Novak, a former Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman. “Her preparation, strategically, helped her control the flow of that debate. It was like a basketball game when the pace is dictated by one team. She clearly did that. His focus was on himself, explaining too much about him. The opportunity was missed to go after vulnerable points on her.” “He started out having a little bit of a better [performance] than what I was anticipating, on trade issues I believe he had her back on her heels in the very first part,” said a veteran North Carolina Republican strategist, working on several races in the state. “There were a lot of opportunities, when they got into discussing cybersecurity, to inject emails, the whole narrative of her carelessness, national security matters and all that. It was a missed opportunity by Trump that comes from a lack of being prepared.” In interviews with more than a dozen battleground state Republican leaders, there was widespread agreement that Trump’s core supporters would continue to stand by him, and that the election would remain close in their states — they characterized the debate as a failure to accomplish what he needed to, rather than a costly debacle. “Trump had the opportunity to raise questions about her emails, to raise questions about the Clinton Foundation, to raise questions about Benghazi, to raise questions about a host of other things, and he simply failed to do it,” said Charlie Gerow, a GOP strategist based in Pennsylvania. While Trump surrogates criticized moderator Lester Holt after the debate, “The burden was on him to do that,” said Gerow of Trump. The GOP nominee started the debate off strong, many Republicans agreed, initially pushing a message of change and a successful attack on trade policy. But he was repeatedly drawn into protracted fights that didn’t advance his interests, and his lack of policy command was apparent. Trump’s approach to national security and foreign policy was a particular sticking point with Bill Urbanski, a former GOP chair of northeastern Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County, who said he was bothered by Trump’s seemingly contradictory response to a question about whether the U.S. should embrace a no-first-use nuclear weapons policy. “Trump was just nowhere near actually being responsive to the question that was posed,” he said. “I guess it could mean two things: one could be…trying to dodge the question because he was trying to make a particular point, but the way I read that was, he didn’t have an answer to that question.” The end result: Republican-leaners like Urbanski still see no reason to rally to him, raising questions about whether Trump will be able to hit the level of party support achieved by Mitt Romney in Pennsylvania in 2012. “Man, it continues to trouble me,” said Urbanski, who said he would like to back Trump and can’t stomach voting for Clinton. “This guy is not qualified for this job. He presents himself that way every time I see him. I can’t get over that hurdle.” Added Gerow, “My sense is, no minds were changed last night among those who had cemented their views…but among the 8, 10, 12, 15 percent who are still genuinely persuadable, I think last night slowed down, if not halted, Trump’s momentum. That’s, I think, the problem. He’s got to try to regain momentum. He has to get back on offense.” While there are still two debates to go, there won’t be many better chances to win over undecided voters, convince fence-sitting Republicans or energize the base. In Ohio’s Warren County, party regulars were primed for the first showdown between Clinton and Trump, hoping to see him stick it to Clinton at a local GOP watch party. “We had folks from the statewide and national party, we had local party folks and then we had Trump campaigners, and we had citizens at large,” said Jeff Monroe, the Warren County GOP chairman. “They were totally into it and all jazzed up, more so than I anticipated. The energy level in the room was significantly better than I anticipated.” But when asked for Trump’s strongest moments in the debate, Monroe explained his impression this way. “It’s more along the lines that there wasn’t anything catastrophic that would change the outcome,” he said. “I think that what we saw was that he was doing his very best to distinguish himself from both political sets. He was taking that approach,” Monroe said. “I think that’s going to play well with a lot of the folks that are supporting him. Regardless of whether or not, as the pundits have pointed out, there was some slippage later on, he distinguished himself.” Florida’s Republican National Committeeman, Peter Feaman, similarly said he couldn’t think of a “high or low point” for Trump in the debate. But he said Trump did accomplish one important task: He proved he could appear presidential, addressing a weakness that has dogged him among some Republicans in the swing state with the largest haul of electoral votes. “It was pretty plain. I don’t think it contained what a lot of the viewers were hoping to see, which were fireworks. That wasn’t the goal at this point,” he said. Trump certainly didn’t deliver anything to persuade Sandra Kase, who serves on the Kingston municipal council in Luzerne County. A lifelong Republican who says she cannot vote for Clinton, Kase said Trump allowed the Democratic nominee to bait him, raising questions about his judgment and his ability to control his temper with world leaders. Equally worrisome, the GOP nominee failed to make strides toward winning over women like Kase in a state where Clinton holds a 14-point edge of Trump among likely women voters, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. “Just his attitude toward women, sexism, everything that comes out of his mouth turns me off. I’m sorry, I can’t say a good thing about him,” she said. “Just the whole atmosphere of the debate, his whole attitude, his reaction — I don’t think he has the temperament. As soon as someone goads him into something, he blasts out what we wants to say and feels that’s OK, and it’s not.”",1,0,0
987,"Hillary Clinton’s recent reference to many of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables” comprised of racists and homophobes only made explicit what her advertisements and other public statements have insinuated. Three weeks ago, she released a video that confronts Trump with the support he has received from white supremacists. In it, Jared Taylor, editor and founder of the white-supremacist magazine American Renaissance, is quoted from an interview with CNN: “Sending out all the illegals, building a wall, add a moratorium on Islamic immigration—that’s very appealing to a lot of ordinary white people.” Story Continued Below It’s pretty obvious what Clinton hopes to get from this line of campaigning: Underscoring Trump’s endorsements from white supremacists might deter moderates, independents and mainstream Republicans who are loath to be associated with the right-wing fringe. However, her mudslinging also condemns Trump voters—half of them, at least—who may support Trump’s social platform, but not in the interest of institutionalizing the supremacy of white people. These white working-class voters support Trump because he articulates their complicated discomfort with immigration and demographic change. Some observers are quick to call them racist—and certainly some are. But over the past six months, I’ve interviewed more than 100 white working-class people both here and in the United Kingdom, where a similar nationalist surge has triggered accusations of racism. My interviews suggest that there is a complexity to Trump’s supporters that is not as simplistic as a yes-no binary about whether they’re racist. Millions of Trump’s supporters exist in the vast space between Wall Street and Breitbart. Is it racist to associate immigration with the greater globalization of commerce that has altered the economic prospects of outmoded people? Is it racist to be frustrated that members of ethnic minorities are rendered new advantages unavailable to white people, such as affirmative action policies and ethnicity-specific advocacy? Is it racist to believe that white working-class people are underrepresented in political leadership or vilified in popular media? Clinton’s decision to lump all voters with these concerns into the sweeping category of “racist” might motivate her base, and might even be correct as a short-term political calculation: She probably won’t win over these voters. But there’s a long-term societal risk here: Shunning them as racists pushes them only deeper into pockets of private discomfort, where their perceptions go unexposed and unchallenged—entrenching their views and further polarizing the American public. Ultimately, Clinton’s statements will worsen a long-term social dilemma among the voters she broad-brushes—how Americans understand racism itself. *** “Racism” is a powerful word in American culture, and an important one to talk about. It’s the right way to describe the long history of prejudice and discrimination against people on the basis of their looks and ancestry. It’s also important to identify in modern society, linking contemporary expressions and ideas to earlier injustices, such as the enslavement of blacks or the genocide of native people. While they may not be equivalent, housing discrimination and police violence against African-Americans—enduring forms of racism—are thus rightly seen as legacies of past oppression. This is valuable because it contextualizes the choices and policies of contemporary Americans in our troubled history of race. However, allegations of racism are now viewed by many white people as a means of wielding their ancestors’ misdeeds to unfairly disqualify their dissenting viewpoints in the present. In the view of many of the voters Trump is speaking to—not just the “alt-right,” but disaffected white voters across the board—it’s crucial to talk frankly, even critically, about the perils of Islam, immigration and Black Lives Matter, even if it means offending some listeners. And on the more politically activated end of that spectrum, such voters see suppression of their ideas is part of a broader conspiracy to impose a liberal worldview. It’s a perception that has been seized by Trump—“We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,” he said in his July GOP convention speech—but also by far-right leaders in Europe, like Britain’s Nigel Farage, the former head of the UK Independence Party and one of the leaders behind the UK's departure from the European Union. Both Trump and Farage have heralded the power of their countries’ “silent majority”—a hushed constituency of predominantly white voters whose views have long been ignored. Many of these purportedly ignored views scapegoat minority groups for broader social problems—often based on stereotypes, myths and prejudice. But even well-meaning conservative critiques of social policies have been tarnished by far less valid accusations of racism. From the time I’ve spent interviewing white working-class people in the United States and the UK, I’ve seen how many people find Trump’s and Farage’s unfiltered statements refreshing. The two men elevate hearsay to podiums and shout the very ideas that supporters have been too intimidated to mutter under their breath. In Britain, dozens of my respondents would often preface their most candid thoughts to me by stating “I’m not a racist, but … ” “I’m not racist, but this country’s covered by blacks and Bosnians.” “I’m not racist at all. I’ve got black cousins and nieces. But the Polish have been taking all of the work and running prostitution and drug rings.” “I’m not a racist. I fucking love goat curry, pardon my language. But the principle of English families not coming first is just not right.” These individuals had not endured hours of sensitivity training; they were concerned that their ideas would be disqualified, when they are, in fact, sincere expressions about how their societies are being transformed. Racism is perceived to be a “mute button” pressed on someone while they are still crying out about a sense of lost status—from a position of historic advantage, frequently in terms they have difficulty articulating. Therefore, the preface “I’m not racist” is not a disclaimer, but rather an exhortation to listen and not dismiss or invalidate the claims of a group that feels marginalized. Interestingly, those respondents who were able to more specifically articulate their frustration framed it in the civil rights themes of equality and justice. An unemployed 18-year-old Londoner said, “You go for an interview and most of the employers are Asians. Basically, they’re discriminating against us, and we were here first. I have some training as a retail sales assistant. But when I’ve submitted my CV, I’ve been told that I can’t apply because I’m not Asian. … I feel like I’m beneath them.” Back in the United States, an electrician from Youngstown, Ohio, told me that “white people have become the minority itself. … People have freaked out on me for things I’ve said because I can’t say anything [about black people] because of slavery and their historical oppression. People aren’t looking for equality; they’re looking for retaliation.” These two were not members of any white-supremacist group. Many white working-class individuals simply view the broader struggle against racism as one that demotes white people, rather than promotes others to equal ground. They feel estranged from minority groups, who they believe have access to new privileges that compensate for historic advantages that today’s white working-class people do not recall exploiting. They feel alienated from an urban white bourgeoisie, which has divorced their less skilled or geographically isolated co-ethnics and look down upon them. And they feel blamed for neither empathizing with the plight of minorities, nor mobilizing to overcome structural poverty and embrace global cosmopolitanism. *** To govern effectively, Hillary Clinton needs white people to buy into the social change she heralds. So instead of casting them as outmoded bigots, she could point to how the very social forces that entrench white working-class people into poverty also entrench minority groups—that there are no white problems or minority problems; there are just problems. She can assert that the status quo for white (and nonwhite) working-class people is reinforced not by the pursuit of political correctness, but instead by the propagation of racial divisions between us. By dismissing Trump’s supporters as racist—however rightfully in many cases—Clinton further numbs many white people to the sensitivity with which racism was once regarded. It erects a barrier between Clinton’s pursuit of equal justice and the defensive holdouts with whom she must ultimately cooperate to achieve her vision of social progress. Silencing and demonizing Trump’s supporters as racists simplistically shuns them into the ideological silos that segregate our society. We will never find common ground if we don’t share space.",1,0,0
369,"(CNN)The nation's billionaires -- energized by a presidential race heading down to the wire and led to believe that their money can tip the balance -- are digging deep. Sheldon Adelson has now pledged $45 million to Republicans, with $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund announced this week. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz this month promised $20 million to Democrats. And Michael Bloomberg is likely to dedicate $15 million to his pro-gun control group that has backed both parties, CNN has learned. The investments come as the value of hefty fundraising and television advertising has been thrown into question this year thanks to Donald Trump's largely free-media driven campaign. Meanwhile, the failure of big-money candidates like Jeb Bush and the ability of Bernie Sanders to raise tens of millions of dollars from small donors underscored questions about whether big money packs the same punch this election cycle as it once did. But as Election Day nears, many of the top 1 percent decided they still think their checks matter. ""The fundraisers have been calling for a while. Now we're all kind of settled back in, the summer's over, and you look up and, man, this election's right on top of ya,"" said Steve Mostyn, a Democratic trial lawyer who gave $1 million to Hillary Clinton's super PAC and is prepared to give another $1 million to it before the election wraps. Mostyn, like other donors, said the increasing competitiveness of the presidential and Senate races made him feel he needed to join in. In a non-competitive race, an extra million might just be gravy. So Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmental activist, committed another $15 million to his Democratic super PAC. The Ricketts family of the Midwest -- which financed substantial amounts of the barrage against Donald Trump during the Republican primary -- is now organizing millions to support him. And a batch of out-of-nowhere megadonors -- whether it's pro-Israel philanthropist Cherna Moskowitz on the right or Hollywood filmmaker Thomas Tull on the left — are leaving their mark. Too much, too late? And TV, or not TV? Yet the biggest givers may have waited too long, depending on how they want to spend their money. With each passing week, the millions have smaller utility as advertising rates spike and early votes are cast. Steyer is an exception, routing his millions to his own personal super PAC, Next Gen Climate Action, along with a super PAC co-run with a labor unions, For our Future. Both of the groups are funneling their money into a field program -- not paid media. ""We believe in the traditional American democratic process where neighbors talk to neighbors about the most important issues affecting their lives,"" Steyer said in a statement to CNN. ""That's something you can't squeeze into a 15 second ad."" The other rising Democratic donor: Moskovitz, who sent ripples through the donor world when he pledged $20 million to a variety of liberal and Democratic Party groups, but didn't give to Clinton TV ad powerhouse Priorities USA. Moskovitz told CNN that he had ""nothing more to announce"" about any potential gift to Priorities. While he is ""primarily focused on the top"" of the ticket, he described Priorities as ""distinguished by focusing on TV more than anything else."" Bloomberg, the former Republican-turned-independent New York City mayor who has endorsed Clinton, does not plan to give to Priorities USA either, according to Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg political adviser. But he will likely end up spending $15 million for his Independence USA, Wolfson said. The group has already spent in Senate races for Republican incumbent Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania and Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, and is assessing whether to air advertisements in other states, Wolfson said. For the GOP, the pro-Trump, Ricketts-led effort, is a bet that TV does indeed work. The Ricketts are donating $1 million to their group, Future 45, and hope to raise a total of $25 million in this campaign's closing weeks. They plan to run ads in six states with competitive Senate races: Florida, Nevada, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Iowa, according to the head of the PAC, Brian Baker. It's unclear how many of the traditional donors that have been allied with the Ricketts family are following them into the fray. Future 45 was dormant for months after Trump won the nomination. Several major donors who have given to Ricketts-led groups in the past did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether they would fund Future 45. Some, like Home Deport founder Bernie Marcus and former US Senate candidate Linda McMahon, are publicly backing Trump and looking for ways to give. Others, like California investor Bill Obendorf and Chicago hedge funder Ken Griffin, are not. Offered a chance to say whether Griffin planned to support the group, a Griffin spokesman declined to comment. John Jordan, a California vinter and large Republican donor who has worked closely with the Ricketts family, said he regarded their political operation as savvy and effective. But he said that the late infusion of cash would have little impact. ""I feel bad for the people who wrote the checks,"" said Jordan. ""You can only spend so much effectively at the last minute."" Adelson's impact The decision by Adelson to partner with the Ricketts operation is a blow to the Trump super PACs that have been trying to land him as a landmark donor. One group, Rebuilding America Now, has secured million-dollar checks from Marcus thanks in part due to the fundraising skills of Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who leads the group. But many other well-heeled Trump supporters are still on the sidelines. Foster Friess, the Wyoming social conservative, told CNN earlier this month that while Scott's ""leadership is reassuring,"" he is not investing his dollars in the super PAC. A second group run by a billionaire family close to Trump, Bob and Rebekah Mercer, appears to be in favor, and they won a new $1 million last month from Moskowitz, a California philanthropist. She did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about her donation plans. The Adelson's gift to the pro-Trump effort -- likely to be around $5 million -- is substantially smaller than some had hoped, and the decision to relinquish control over their dollars to a separate donor family direct the effort is surprising. Yet some Democrats appear willing to go dollar-for-dollar with their Republican rivals. Mostyn, the Democratic lawyer who is hosting Tim Kaine for a fundraiser later this week in Houston, said he found the donation sizes of Adelson and Ricketts to be underwhelming, but that Trump's recent strength has him more eager to return fundraising calls. ""On my list of things to do today,"" Mostyn said, ""getting back to them has gone way up."" ",1,0,0
1094,"Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the controversial “stop-and-frisk” policing practice to be instituted nationwide as a means of combating violent crime in America’s inner cities. In a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community” and “black-on-black crime.” Trump responded by proposing that “stop-and-frisk” policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. Story Continued Below “I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,” Trump told the questioner. “You understand, you have to have, in my opinion, I see what’s going on here, I see what’s going on in Chicago, I think stop-and-frisk. In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked. Now, we had a very good mayor, but New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.” The practice, carried out most famously in New York but also by other police departments, is frequently criticized as an avenue for officers commit acts of racial profiling. Others tout it as responsible for a dramatic drop in New York City’s crime rate, although former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said in 2015 that the practice is “not a significant factor in the crime rate of this city.”",1,0,0
481,"Newark (CNN)Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday. David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign. Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony. Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone."" On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein responded. A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday. ""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision. Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony. Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed. This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said. Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly. Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date. Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes. On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9. Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess."" Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly. ""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office. Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns. Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie. All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study. On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge. ""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified. A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground. Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased."" Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned. Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests. Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made. Kelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses. ",1,0,0
231,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's debate study habits, Hillary Clinton's strategy on millennials and the latest electoral trends in swing state Ohio -- they're just some of the future headlines in our ""Inside Politics"" forecast this week. 1. Debate crunch time, and questions about Trump's prep The first presidential debate is a week from Monday, and Donald Trump has made time on his Sunday schedule for prep sessions with senior advisers. But the unconventional nature of his candidacy extends to his study habits, and some on his team are a bit worried. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times shared her reporting on Trump's aversion to holding mock debate sessions, among other things. ""He's playing it a little bit loose and in his sort of free-form style,"" said Haberman. ""But a lot of people around him are concerned that won't translate quite as well in a general election debate."" 2. Obama skipping Clinton Foundation event The Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the Clinton Foundation, will hold its annual -- and final -- gathering Monday and Tuesday in New York. It's held at the same time as the United Nations General Assembly for obvious reasons: Major global leaders are in New York and can be sprinkled throughout the CGI sessions. But one big name will be missing from this CGI meeting. Julie Pace of the Associated Press notes that the Clintons' initiative has come under fire this election year. ""Hillary Clinton would be happy if she could get through the rest of the campaign without having to talk anymore about the foundation, but she's going to have to grin and bear it for a few more days,"" said Pace. ""This is a three-day gathering with lots of celebrities, lots of big donors -- but there's some speculation it might not be as glitzy as in past years. And there's going to be one very notable absence headlining this meetings, and that's President Barack Obama."" 3. Clinton targets millennials in Ohio It's no secret Hillary Clinton has issues with younger voters, and she is looking to turn the tide. On Monday, Clinton will travel to Ohio to make her case to millennials by retracing some of her early work as a lawyer. Abby Philip of the Washington Post says trying to get younger voters to relate more to Clinton is the big goal. ""The focus of the speech is going to be about her early years -- what she did after she left college -- the focus on idealism and reminding young voters that she was kind of like them,"" said Phillip. ""And also like someone else, a young community organizer from Chicago, Barack Obama."" Will this humanize her? Make her seem more like a real person and less like a politician? Stay tuned. 4. Signs of progress for Trump in swing state Ohio is always a giant presidential battleground, and the GOP primary candidacy of its governor, John Kasich, adds another interesting wrinkle this year. Kasich is no Donald Trump fan -- far from it -- but some Ohio Republicans see signs that even former Kasich primary voters are turning to Trump in the general election. There's a lot of talk about the influx of newly registered Republican voters and CNN's Sara Murray reports that GOPers surveying those new party members in the Buckeye State are finding firmer-than-expected Trump support. ""They're finding Donald Trump has strong support from Democrats who are now Republicans, Independents who are now Republicans,"" Murray said. ""People who registered to vote for John Kasich in the primaries are now backing Trump. And what should be particularly worrisome for Democrats in Ohio is that they (the GOP) are finding far more support than they expected among female voters."" 5. Mixed ballots in Ohio pose dilemma  Suppose you're working a Republican phone bank in Ohio and a voter tells you they plan to vote for Hillary Clinton for president and Republican Rob Portman for U.S. Senate. Do you take time -- and resources -- to follow up with that voter to make sure they cast their ballot? Democrats privately concede that Portman appears to be on an easy path to re-election, so it is less of a conflict for them. Ohio is a tough state, and the Clinton campaign will try to motivate every last potential voter to turn out, no matter who they support for the Senate. But what about the Republican Party's ground-game efforts? Ostensibly such efforts are on behalf of all Republicans, but GOP candidates who don't have the best relationship with Trump don't all trust the RNC to fight on their behalf. So Portman is relying on his own get-out-the-vote effort. Those who have seen recent GOP polling in the state say this is one good reason why: Some 20% of Clinton voters in Ohio say they are planning to vote Republican for Senate. ",1,0,0
93,"Nate Smith, executive director of the Texas Nationalist Movement, looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east Ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to Smith’s struggle for an independent Texas. Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card. It wasn’t the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbed Moscow’s international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories. Amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed ""King of Hawaii,"" who called in via video link. And among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States. The conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation. The conference’s organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism.     “Our main goal is to create a multi-polar world,” the conference’s creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. “Our president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.” Ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago. Ionov’s conference plays into Moscow’s own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part. All that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the Kremlin’s orbit. “It’s kind of awkward I guess,” Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity.   Smith’s group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin. “We’re here to have a dialogue. We’re not in agreement with all the groups that are here,” Smith said. “We’re here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.” It was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation. “We want to draw attention to our campaign,” Marinelli said. “We’re not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that."" The two secessionists’ urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019. “The U.S. government is so dysfunctional it can’t be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians,” Marinelli said. Both men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.'s recent ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees. But why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested. “I’m not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,” Smith said. However, the conference -- and its location in one of Moscow’s expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly funding France’s anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets. “It’s a school-book case,” said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studied Russia’s use of the far right. “The simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.” Kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy. “The tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos,” Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy. Few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out. “Everybody’s using everybody,” Marinelli said. “We’re using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..."" he trailed off before finishing. “Everybody’s got their own agenda, right? So, that’s just the way it is.” For most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conference’s oddity. “I’ve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I've got to get my story out,” said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican Sinn Féin, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland. In any case, Mac Dubhglais said, he wouldn’t let “Vladimir himself” impose ideas on him. “I’m not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,"" he said. Besides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. “Maybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,” he said then paused, before adding: “I’m hoping that’s what they think.""",1,0,0
379,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it. Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video, plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself. ""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs. Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump. ""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention. The interview is part of the Clinton campaign's attempt to show a funnier, softer side of the former secretary of state. Led by Kristina Schake, Clinton's deputy communications director, the effort has seen Clinton do a number of non-traditional interviews like the one with Galifianakis. Galifianakis opened the interview with, ""Critics have questioned some of your decision making recently and by you doing this show I hope it finally puts it to rest."" Clinton deadpanned, ""I think it absolutely proves their case, don't you?"" Clinton is not the first politician to sit down with Galifianakis. President Barack Obama also sat down with the comedian in 2014 to tout the Affordable Care Act. RELATED: The backstory to the Obama-Galifianakis Funny or Die video Nodding to the historic significance of Clinton's candidacy, the comedian joked that while she could be the first female president, ""for a younger, younger generation, you will also become their first white president and that is pretty neat, too."" Trump was not spared during the interview. Galifianakis also asked if Clinton will lead the civil war if Trump wins. Clinton says, ""No, I wouldn't take up arms. I think that might be a little extreme."" ""Oh right, because you were saying before we were rolling that you wanted to take away everyone's guns. Very cool,"" Galifianakis jokes. ""I really regret doing this,"" Clinton says. After implying that Clinton's pantsuits make her look like a ""librarian from outer space,"" Galifianakis also asks Cllinton what she thinks Trump will wear to the debate. ""I assume he will wear that red power tie,"" Clinton says. ""Or maybe like a white power tie,"" Galifianakis says. ""That is even more appropriate,"" Clinton adds. The over 5-minute interview closes with a joke about Clinton's email controversy. ""Well, this has been a lot of fun Mrs. Clinton,"" Clinton says. ""We should stay in touch. What is the best way to reach you? Email."" Clinton responds by staring the comedian down. ",1,0,0
1297,"There were a couple of not-so-very-subtle signals here inside of Hofstra University that Donald Trump lost Monday night’s highly-anticipated debate against Hillary Clinton, and badly. The first was the audible sound of groaning by some of his supporters (picked up by my attentive colleague Steve Shepard) inside the debate hall as Trump meandered self-defensively through a succession of answers against a very focused, very energized and very well-rehearsed Hillary Clinton. Story Continued Below Another tell: After the 90-minute sparring match finished, Clinton’s team practically bounded into the spin room – more in glassy-eyed disbelief than visible elation that things had gone so much better than expected. The GOP nominee’s people, by contrast, dribbled into the media pen like surly seventh-graders headed for homeroom the day before summer vacation. “F—k, let’s do this,” a prominent Trump surrogate said before diving into a scrum. Trump and his new-ish messaging team have labored mightily to turn the avatar of populist rage into a reasonable facsimile of someone who you could see sitting in the Oval Office. But this best-laid plan unraveled on Monday – amid Clinton’s steely assault and the dignified interrogation of NBC’s Lester Holt, who struck a deft balance between facilitator, BS detector and lion tamer. Within minutes of the opening bell, Clinton’s attacks forced domesticated Donald to go feral – he bellowed, interrupted her repeatedly, grunted, and toward the bedraggled end, became muted and pouty. “It was bizarre,” said Barack Obama’s campaign manager David Plouffe, who, like many Clinton allies, seemed visibly relieved. “He was clearly rattled, and clearly focused on defending himself, which I’m told narcissists are prone to do, and he clearly faded at the end. It’s not like she’s going to jump out to a 10-point lead, but this was good.” Whether or not this reverses Trump’s momentum, or reestablishes Clinton's control of the race is an open question. Who won is not. Here are five takeaways. Trump was wimpy when defensive. He is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most. It doesn’t take a Jung (or even Dr. Phil after a couple of Bud Lights) to figure out that the GOP nominee – who boasts like a barfly – just might be over-compensating. Hence, Clinton, who started the debate a little tentatively, quickly launched into a carefully planned program of Freudian mind-games, contrasting her own middle-class businessman dad (who had his own issues) with Trump’s imperious, larger-than-life father Fred who launched his son’s business career but also was said to be extremely tough on him. First she started in with a paean to her father’s running a small printing business in Chicago (This might be the first time a candidate has described, in detail, the silk-screen squeegee process on a debate stage) – then she pivoted to mocking supposedly self-made Trump’s start in the real estate business. “You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father,” she said icily. “My father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” he responded weakly – and so it went on a range of topics. Whether it was because Clinton was so well prepped, and Trump was so breezily unprepared – or had a simple case of opening night jitters – the bully-boy nominee abandoned his most effective mode of debate combat, answering an attack with a harsher one. She went right for Trump’s ego – questioning his questionable $11 billion net worth, his boastful record on job creation and picking apart his tough talk on fighting ISIS. In 2007, preparing for a primary race she’d eventually lose, Clinton told me that the key to presidential political campaigns was understanding that the most effective attacks weren’t about exploiting someone’s weaknesses but challenging an opponent’s perceived strengths. When confronted with that assault, Trump wilted and offered a series of meandering answers that had his Republicans wincing. “It was a draw,” former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown said. “But he was on the defensive far too much. That’s a direct result of his inexperience.” What about the Clinton Foundation? The former secretary’s debate team (including longtime aide Phillippe Reines, who snapped a pre-debate photo in a Trump circled-finger pose) expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her family’s foundation. They were worried about it. While he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. His “30 years” attack worked – and he’ll use it again. Trump may have lost the first debate, but he’s proven to be a fast learner, and is likely to come back stronger in early October for the second debate, a town hall style affair, in St. Louis. And there were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra – the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) on Clinton’s effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life. The been-there-not-done-that argument was particularly useful when coupled with his usual slams on Bill Clinton’s passage of the increasingly unpopular NAFTA agreement from the 1990s and Hillary Clinton’s election-year flip-flop from TPP booster to opponent. “When she started talking about this, it was really very recently,” Trump said of her opposition to the trade deal. “She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact.” When Clinton claimed that she planned to “really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.” He scoffed, and shot back, “But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years.” Clinton effectively attacked his business career. Trump’s attempt to head off debate-night questions about his five-year campaign promoting the birther slander against Barack Obama was a humbling face-plant. His attempt to pin the origin of the charge against Clinton associate Sid Blumenthal was semi-effective with the political press, but it withered under the insistent interrogation of an African-American moderator determined to extract an apology or reasonable explanation. Trump offered neither – and suggested Obama should actually be grateful he pursued the canard because it’s now been resoundingly put to rest. Politically, his tortured explanation helps energize black voters – who already oppose him in historic numbers. But later in the debate, Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents: Trump’s failure to turn over his tax returns. Clinton went there with a vengeance – engaging in a little Trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality TV star. “So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?” Clinton mused, with relish. “And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings... Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.” Trump’s answer did more harm than good: “That makes me smart,” he said – referring to his business, not his political, acumen. Her most effective attack – and his worst answer. If the GOP nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate, he got it when Clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years. Again, Clinton brought it back to her father, describing how bad he would have felt if one of his clients had accepted his work without paying his bill. ""I’ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, marble installers, drapery installers, who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do,” Clinton said, delivering a carefully scripted attack. “We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do.” This is a particular dangerous issue for a candidate whose entire campaign is rooted in fighting for the working class -- and his flippant response, yet again, gave comfort to his enemies. “Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,” Trump quipped.",1,0,0
776,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants. This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year. The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin. Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”  According to the Daily Mail, Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’ Mrs Merkel attempted to defend her August decision, which drew hundreds of thousands to Europe, claiming it was a ‘humanitarian imperative’. She appealed to the party’s sense of history, saying that the same strength that allowed it ‘to rebuild from the rubble of the war to create the economic miracle, and to go from division to a reunified country’ would get Germany through the crisis. She said she was banking on a multi-pronged approach to cut migrant numbers, urging bolstered protection for the bloc’s external borders, support for Turkey to host refugees long-term and a long-shot bid for a distribution scheme among EU member states. She also touted a range of measures already undertaken in Germany including speeding up the deportation of failed asylum applicants. Mrs Merkel, who has been the country’s leader for a decade, tried to paint an upbeat vision saying it was no longer the ‘sick man of Europe’ and ‘should be a country that is open, curious, tolerant and even exciting’.  It’s nice that she recognizes this, but it’s too little, too late. It came as no surprise to anyone voting Trump, but then again, it’s getting tiring to say “I told you so” so many times to so many different people. Hillary is still full-steam ahead on increasing the number of migrants into the country, so there’s no telling what can happen if she is allowed to win the election. We have to stop her in November by storming the voting booths and voting with our consciences. (Source: Daily Mail) ",0,0,1
1506,"As if this week was not tragic enough, we get hit with this news. It seems as if every member of NASCAR is beloved in some form or fashion. There are just some really fine people involved within this sport, and there has been for years and years. A cool thing about NASCAR is that it’s not just the drivers that are well known and loved. It’s their crew chiefs or family members. It’s executives, hardcore fans and amazing reporters. Everyone has an amazing role to play in the sport of NASCAR. Sadly, two of those beloved members have passed away. Bob Margolis and Herbert Ames. Two of some of the finest men in all of NASCAR.  Herbert was more of a beloved friend of NASCAR. He was involved in many things that gave on the behalf of the sport, and he was long time friends with almost everybody in NASCAR. Tom Jensen, reporter for Fox Sports, expressed Herbert’s personality in a great way: “If you walked up to him and asked what he did in the sport, he’d bellow loudly and say, ‘Whatever the hell I want to do!'” Margolis was known for being a first-rate writer and reporter for NASCAR. He was different than everybody else because he gave younger writers a chance to really show what they got in the complicated world of NASCAR. He always told it exactly how it was and was loved for that. It’s clear that Bob captured the hearts of many more than he probably ever knew. Both of these are already extremely missed by many in the NASCAR community, as they are mourning their losses. I played a little golf with Jim Hunter and Herbert Ames… I can only imagine the heckling taking place between those two right now. #RIP — Jimmie Johnson (@JimmieJohnson) September 22, 2016  My thoughts are also with the family and friends of @BobMargolis. — Jimmie Johnson (@JimmieJohnson) September 22, 2016  To hear we lost @BobMargolis this morning is hard to fathom…I'll cherish the time & conversations we shared over the past couple of years. — Daniel Hemric (@DanielHemric) September 22, 2016  I listened intently to what Bob Margolis had to say. He understood the complexities of the sport & hit them head-on. Prayers to his family. — Jim Cassidy (@jfcassidy) September 22, 2016  It’s always horrible to lose great people, but we know they’re in a much better place than here! Our thoughts and prayers are with both of these men’s friends and families as they navigate what to do in the coming days. ",0,0,1

1018,"Hillary Clinton is a copycat who’s probably sleeping because she needs to rest, Donald Trump suggested Tuesday. In a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing “two big rallies” in North Carolina, Trump accused the Democratic presidential nominee of “copying my airplane” and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof. Story Continued Below “Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies — she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning,” Trump mused in a tweet Tuesday morning. “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,” he added minutes later. “Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!” Trump’s critical comments come shortly after Clinton warned voters during a radio interview with Steve Harvey, “The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.” Clinton also previewed what she expects from Trump in Monday's presidential debate in New York, telling Harvey she will do her “very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent.” “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff,” she added. “I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.” Trump also attacked Clinton earlier Tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the Islamic State as head of the State Department. “Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” he said. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.” Clinton has no public events planned for Tuesday and has opted to stay at home in Chappaqua, New York, as she prepares for the debate with Trump. She had a full campaign schedule on Monday — between holding a news conference in White Plains, New York, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in Philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in New York City. She is scheduled to return to Florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on Wednesday. Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.",1,0,0
794,"Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is a stud. He knows how to govern which is not something I can say for the POTUS (President of the United States). Gov. Abbott, representing Texas, informed the Office of Refugee Resettlement that they would be withdrawing from the program on Jan. 31, 2017. This past weekend there were several terrorist attacks in the United States (of which Obama has yet to have any decent response) that have given pause to any thinking leader in our nation to allow Muslim refugees into their state. The biggest issue for Gov. Abbott is that Obama hasn’t been able to ensure the states that the refugees being sent are not terrorists or do not pose a terror threat. He had his Texas administration draft a plan that would require federal national security officials to provide assurances that none of the individuals being resettled pose a terror threat. “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” “While many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston,” Abbott said. “Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people,” he added. “Therefore, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives.” Can you blame a Governor whose main goal is to protect his constituents? I’m pretty sure Liberals think he is evil and will paint him to be a villain, racist who selfishly refuses to share his resources with poor refugees with nowhere else to turn. But the thing he’s not willing to share are the lives of women and children sitting in a shopping mall drinking an Orange Julius unprepared for a suicide bomber to sit at the table next to them. This is America, let’s keep it that way. If other countries want their citizens to live in terror, it is their right. It is also our right to implement strategies of security. ",0,0,1
1370,"Last Saturday, thousands of people were about to participate in a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors in New Jersey when they discovered a bomb had been planted in an area where the crowd would be standing. Later that evening, nine people were stabbed at a shopping mall in Minnesota in a horrific act of violence by a man making references to ‘Allah’.   Obama, the President of the United States, MUST have heard about the New Jersey and New York bombings earlier Saturday before giving his speech at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Dinner. Minnesota stabbings had just barely happened. Dozens were injured, so Obama MUST have been told, right? Then about 8:40 PM, a dumpster exploded outside of the Associated Blind Housing facility in New York City. There we NO sensitivities as Obama began his speech. 2 minutes into his speech he joked about ‘ISIL’ which was terrible, horrible and very tacky timing. “I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” Obama said. “I mean, ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.” At one point in the speech, he delivered an impassioned plea to the black community to stop Donald Trump, saying he would consider it a “personal insult” to his legacy if black voters didn’t turn out for Hillary Clinton. Looks like the Democrats are struggling and rightly so as the NY Post just reported on a new poll that shows Trump dramatically increasing with black voters. Trump just saw a 16.5 percentage-point increase in backing from African-American voters in a Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California tracking poll, up from 3.1 percent on Sept. 10 to 19.6 percent through Friday.

311,"Washington (CNN)The State Department welcomed Sudan's efforts to counter ISIS and other terrorist groups Tuesday despite the fact that Sudan has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for more than 20 years. ""The United States welcomes Sudan's recent efforts to increase counterterrorism cooperation with the United States,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. ""Sudan has taken important steps to counter ISIL and other terrorist groups and has sought to prevent their movement into and through Sudan. Sudan's continued cooperation will bolster international efforts to combat terrorism in the broader region,"" Kirby added, using the government's preferred acronym for ISIS. Kirby went on to say that the governments of the US and Sudan would cooperate ""on counterterrorism to enhance the security of both our countries,"" adding that such cooperation would be ""subject to and consistent with‎ US law."" The State Department labeled Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993. ""Sudan was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 due to concerns about support to international terrorist groups to include the Abu Nidal Organization, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah,"" according to the department's 2015 report on terrorism, though the report notes that Sudan's support to those groups ""appeared to have declined"" in 2015. The country also was home to Osama bin Laden and his followers from 1991 until 1996, with the department's terrorism report saying bin Laden was ""provided safe haven in Sudan for five years until he was expelled by the Sudanese government in 1996."" While there, bin Laden is believed to have helped orchestrate several terror attacks. He was eventually expelled by the Sudanese government for his involvement with al Qaeda and subsequently relocated to Afghanistan. Sudan is one of only three countries to be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, with the other two being Syria and Iran. When asked about the apparent contradiction, Kirby issued a statement to CNN, saying, ""We engage bilaterally in a number of areas and cooperation in these areas will help us normalize ties."" But, he added, ""Complete normalization of relations would require significant progress in a range of other areas, including an end to the fighting in Darfur and the Two Areas."" The latter designation refers to the South Kordofan and Blue Nile states of Sudan which, along with Darfur, have been the site of violent armed conflict between the government in Khartoum and opposition groups over the past several years. The International Criminal Court issued warrants for the arrest of Sudan's long-serving President Omar al Bashir in 2009 and 2010 for ""crimes against humanity"" and ""war crimes"" pertaining to his actions during the conflict in Darfur. ""As we've consistently said, we would initiate the process of rescinding Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism only if the government of Sudan met all the criteria,"" Kirby said. According to Kirby, these steps included the ""certification that the government of Sudan has not provided support to international terrorism in the preceding six-month period and that the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future,"" noting that the ""process has not been initiated."" ""We have been quite clear with the Sudanese on the steps that need to be taken,"" he added. CNN's Laura Koran contributed to this story",1,0,0

1263,"Glenn Beck, a former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday that he’d have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week. “For the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and it’s my fault,” Beck said on his radio show. Story Continued Below “It’s my fault,” Beck continued. “I should have said: ‘You know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there’s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and he’s kind of a politician, but he’s a different kind of politician. He’s a young politician. He’s a Hispanic, He can win. Let’s go for it.’"" Instead, Beck sought “a truly honorable man” in Cruz — “and that will always let you down,” he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man. “I’m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,” Beck said. “He is just a politician first. I’ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that’s my fault. He is a politician.” For his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November. After Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain). “So a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross — it’s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ‘Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,’ I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it’s a binary choice?” Beck asked. “You are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,” Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America. Beck, however, wasn’t satisfied. “This is information that you had in Cleveland — and hang on just a second before you respond — you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,” Beck said. “So you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: ‘Oh, my gosh, he’s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there’s a reason to believe him.’” Despite his “significant disagreements” with Trump, Cruz said, it’s a binary choice. “I’m asking for new information. I’m asking you for new information,” Beck said. “You knew all the things that you’re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What’s new?” Cruz pointed to the Trump campaign’s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board. “We discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,” Cruz said. After Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. “Now, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,” Cruz said. “I hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ‘I will nominate from these 21,’ I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that’s a clear choice.” Cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he’s always been “Never Hillary” but not ever “Never Trump.” He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter. “My speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,” Cruz said. “Both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.” After Cruz’s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. “He could have come on and said, ‘Look, guys, here’s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,’ and I know that, because so are mine,” he said. “’My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they’re all saying I’ll never fund — I won’t fund you for the Senate. I won’t fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?’”",1,0,0
1318,"House Speaker Paul Ryan is facing a major obstacle in his months-long quest to pass criminal justice reform: unenthused House Republicans still skittish about looking soft on crime. The Wisconsin Republican for weeks has repeated his personal desire to move a bipartisan package that would include allowing well-behaved nonviolent prisoners to be eligible for early release and easing some drug-related sentencing requirements. Story Continued Below It would mark a major accomplishment for the speaker, and a chance for Republicans to show racial minorities they care about issues of social justice — plus a salient, positive message countering Donald Trump’s racially charged bid for the White House. But the odds are decidedly long. With Trump advocating for controversial policies like systematic “stop and frisk,” and the protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, against police-involved shootings causing racial tensions to flare, Ryan’s conference is not eager to vote on the matter. An internal GOP leadership “survey” last week taking House Republicans’ temperature on the issue showed that most members were lukewarm at best. That means that if Ryan wants to make a push for criminal justice reform after the election, he will have his work cut out. “It’s not an easy thing to make these reforms, and the [Judiciary] committee has taken some time doing it; now they’re taking time educating members on it,” Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday of a package of bills drafted by the Judiciary Committee. “It is a priority for the speaker. There are concerns … so we’re getting all the questions answered.” The Judiciary panel last year passed 11 bills to reform federal sentencing laws and improve the prison re-entry system. While the package would not eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, it would significantly reduce sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. It would also create a program to reduce recidivism rates. The politics of criminal justice reform have soured for conservative supporters. Trump has warned repeatedly of dangerous, crime-ridden cities. And the FBI on Monday released new statistics showing that murders increased 11 percent and violent crimes rose 4 percent in the U.S. last year. Though the rates are still low by recent historical standards, it's enough to make law-and-order Republican lawmakers nervous. While proponents argue that reform would go a long way toward easing racial tensions, opponents vow they’ll never vote against the recommendations of law enforcement during a time of unrest. (Some Republican lawmakers worry that law enforcement could come out against the pitch, though many national police groups haven’t taken a position.) Even if Ryan managed to get a bill through the House, the Senate and its 60-vote threshold could stop it in its tracks. Hawkish Republicans, including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, have been sounding the alarm against criminal justice reform. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has shied from the matter because it divides his conference. Democrats by and large support the reform proposals. Sources familiar with Ryan’s thinking say he’s not ready to relent just yet because of the charged political environment. While he wasn’t able to pass the Judiciary package in September as he originally hoped, Ryan is now eyeing the lame-duck session, by which time tensions might have eased. “I’m trying to get criminal justice reform done this session of Congress,” Ryan said last week during a speech at the Economic Club of New York. “That train is on the tracks, and I’m hoping we can get that done sooner rather than later.” The speaker has made second chances and redemption a central theme of his “Better Way” policy agenda, and he views criminal justice reform as key to helping people trying to turn their lives around. During the New York speech, he talked about visiting impoverished communities and being inspired by a onetime drug dealer who became a counselor to addicts, and a gang leader who went on to become an entrepreneur. “I went in expecting to see the worst of America and I came out realizing I had just seen the best of America,” he said. Ryan will have the backing of some big-name conservative allies. The Koch brothers and the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform are major advocates of criminal justice reform. But the skepticism or resistance among Republicans is real. “It doesn’t sell back home right now,” said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee. “When you say, ‘Hey, I’m voting for criminal justice reform,’ they’ll say, ‘What? You’re letting prisoners out of prison early?’” While he personally believes the Justice Committee has crafted some smart proposals, Flores said it doesn’t help that it’s a key priority of President Barack Obama. The situation in Charlotte and elsewhere has also complicated the equation. “I think that what could be a good bill could be perceived differently because of current events,” he said. Rep. Peter King of New York said he’s struggling to make up his mind on the pending reform measures. “I have friends on both sides of the issue, but I don’t know,” he said. “You’re talking about undoing 20 to 30 years of legislation. What are the unintended consequences?” Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said criminal justice reform “has real merit” but that there are “also some concerns.” “If you’re actually going to let people out of prison early, we better make sure they’re not violent people,” he said Sunday on C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” show. “So let’s do it, but let’s do it right.” House leaders hosted a series of member and staff meetings during the August recess to familiarize Republicans with the Judiciary bills. GOP leadership sources say these sorts of sessions can move the needle, and they’re hoping that, over time, the conference will come around. Ryan, however, is racing against the clock. House Republicans will have to fund the government for all of 2017 during the lame-duck session, a contentious issue for the unruly GOP conference. It’s unclear whether Ryan will have the political capital and the bandwidth to do both.",1,0,0
877,"Jimmy Kimmel is back with his “Lie Witness News” segment, in which he submits his subjects to comedic man-on-the-street interviews. In this edition, the Kimmel team asked Donald Trump supporters out in Los Angeles their opinion on the presidential candidates’ tax return situation. Over the past year Trump has come under fire for refusing to release his tax returns, defying what has become tradition in presidential elections. The Donald claims to be going through some unspecified “audit” causing him to postpone, also making the case that his supporters don’t really care about his tax returns. That’s exactly what Kimmel wanted to put to the test, whether his supporters would bat an eyelash in their blind support no matter what the tax returns said. So, in order to see if Trump supporters would care at all about the content of Trump’s tax return, the Kimmel team came up with a bunch of controversial questions to ask about a made up tax return filed by Trump that had just come out. “Was it legitimate for Donald Trump to write off his many marriages as “entertainment”? What do you think of Donald Trump listing his primary occupation as “farmer”? What do you think of Donald Trump donating $50,000 to Subway Jared’s Legal Defense Fund?” Sure enough, Trump supporters were immediately, and without hesitation willing to give him a pass no matter how outlandish or controversial the accusation seemed to be, with answers ranging from “It’s a loophole, if it’s there you’ve gotta utilize it” to “You know, we all kind of fib a little bit.” This goes to show,  sometimes we should be shocked, and outraged when we’re lied to. But nothing will shock Trump supporters, and nothing will make Trump supporters budge. Watch below: ",0,1,0
807,"Charlotte thug rioters gang jumped a man in a parking garage for a really good reason – the guy was white! WHY ELSE WOULD A BUNCH OF BLACK PEOPLE BEAT UP A RANDOM WHITE GUY? The fact that the white guy was in a parking garage meant either he lived there or was visiting someone. Or, he works there. That being said, he probably has a job. Work is something the Black Lives Matter thugs don’t like to participate in. They’d rather sit around being bums all day, then beating people at night every time a cop shoots a criminal. The white guy in this video has nothing to do with the shooting of that Keith Lamont Scott fella or any other black person shot by a cop. It doesn’t even matter if a BLACK COP SHOOTS A BLACK THUG – the losers still use it as an excuse to steal, beat people, and destroy a neighborhood. This is sadly what people are now calling the “black mentality” or the “thug mentality” and it’s extremely sad because that is NOT how things should be. Hannity – Although numerous individual acts of assault, looting, and violence have been reported, one horrible incident seems to capture the chaos that enveloped Charlotte on Wednesday evening. In a video making the rounds on social media, an unidentified man is beaten and dragged along the ground as he begs his assailants for mercy. The beating is said to have taken place in the garage of the Epicenter, a shopping mall in downtown Charlotte This is NOT what being an American is all about. This is NOT what being black or white is about either. There’s so many better black American’s who deserve recognition for the good things they do, but every time riots like this happen, those good people get blurred out by the bad black Americans. I think it’s time for the good people of the African American community to shape up or ship out the loser thugs. #CharlotteProtest Beating man begging for mercy in parking garage. @AC360 @seanhannity @BretBaier Credit:Lenard Bennett (facebook) @ncnaacp pic.twitter.com/YWHEU2UV1n — Libertarian Queen (@LibertarianQn) September 22, 2016  Start reprimanding the thugs on their senseless behavior.

530,"Washington (CNN)When Bernie Sanders stood before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, he promised ""to do everything I can"" to elect Hillary Clinton president. But for much of the summer, Sanders was consumed with authoring a book he plans to release in November, while raising money for progressive candidates down the ticket. He has done just a handful of campaign events for Clinton, and hasn't yet activated his grassroots army that powered him to win more than 12 million votes during the Democratic primary. That's about to change. In recent days, Sanders has privately informed his old rival that he plans a surge of campaign events in key battleground states, including ones the Vermont independent won during the Democratic primary campaign and others with pockets of younger voters turned off by Clinton, according to two sources familiar with the conversations between the two camps. That means more stops in states like Michigan and New Hampshire, and possible trips to Nevada, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Wisconsin. The Clinton camp even plans to deploy Sanders to Minnesota, a state likely to go Democratic in the fall but one the Clinton camp is quietly trying to shore up as Donald Trump gains ground across the country, sources said. On Wednesday, Sanders will appear with Clinton in Durham, New Hampshire, an effort aimed directly at millennials by promoting college affordability. And it comes at a crucial time: Clinton is seeing her support stall among millennial voters, who are turning to Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson instead. In a Tuesday interview with CNN, Sanders promised that he would make the case directly to millennials about Clinton's proposal to ease tuition payments to families earning less than $125,000 annually, calling it a ""big deal."" And he said that he would draw a direct contrast between Trump and Clinton on the issue of humans causing global warming, which the GOP nominee has questioned in the past. ""To the degree that we get those points out, I think she will do a whole lot better among younger people,"" Sanders said. Asked if he should do more for Clinton after keeping a relatively low profile after the convention, Sanders said: ""We will be working very aggressively."" But he would not answer directly when asked if he would activate his small donor network to pour money into Clinton's coffers. ""I'm going to be campaigning as hard as I can,"" Sanders said. A source close to Sanders said it's unlikely he would use his vast email list to help Clinton raise money, instead reserving that for down-ticket candidates. Instead, the source said, Sanders will become a visible presence along the campaign trail in an attempt to turn his core supporters to the Clinton camp -- namely younger voters. Indeed, millennial voters are becoming a significant problem for Clinton, dogged by her email controversy, questions about her honesty and being a long-time fixture of the Democratic establishment. In a Bloomberg poll released this week, Clinton leads Trump 50%-40% among voters under 35 in a two-way race, down from her 29-point lead in August. But when the poll added the Green Party and Libertarian candidates on the ballot, Clinton's lead shrinks to 40%-36% -- with Johnson getting 11% of the millennial vote. To reverse the slide, the Clinton campaign plans to lean on Sanders and other progressive firebrands, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to fire up the base. But top Democrats say that surrogates can only do so much. ""Bernie is going to be out there some more; he's just finishing his book,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday. ""He has been out there for Hillary. He'll be out there more, but she is going to have to make her own case as well because you can only transfer so much."" After a tense primary where Sanders surprised Clinton and the political world by racking up big victories, the two sides developed trust during the July convention when the Vermont independent's team helped squash an uprising by Sanders' backers eager to disrupt the proceedings. On Labor Day, he barnstormed New Hampshire for Clinton -- with two events in the state -- and later did a three-city swing through Ohio. A source close to Sanders said the senator plans to hit the road for House and Senate candidates starting next week, including in states like Washington not considered a presidential battleground. But with Sanders' ability to connect with younger progressives at a time when Clinton is struggling with those voters, many are eager to see the self-described Democratic socialist follow through on his vow to do more to help their presidential nominee. ""We all know the last 30 days is really when you motivate people, and say, 'Hey. You can't sit home, you can't stay out.' And I think (Sanders) knows that's the crucial point,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a top Clinton surrogate. Asked if she were worried about millennial voters flocking to Johnson, McCaskill added: ""It doesn't seem thoughtful to me. It does feel like he could be a spoiler in some regard. But I still feel pretty positive and optimistic about millennials coming around -- especially with Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, and everybody's help.""

233,"Washington (CNN)Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tore into Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on the campaign trail Saturday for lying about President Barack Obama's citizenship and hinting at violence against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Speaking to Clinton supporters at Ohio State University, Warren continued her ongoing feud with Trump by criticizing his admission Friday -- after five years of falsehoods -- that Obama was born in the US. ""Only when his handlers tied him down and forced him did he grudgingly admit that the man was born in the United States,"" Warren said. ""What kind of a man does that? A man with a dark and ugly soul."" Later Friday, Trump, at a campaign event in Miami, cited Clinton's push for greater gun control to suggest the Democrat's Secret Service detail should disarm. ""Let's see what happens to her,"" Trump said. ""Take their guns away, OK? It'll be very dangerous."" That was the second time in as many months when he appeared to urge violence against Clinton. In August, Trump appeared to suggest that ""Second Amendment people"" could do something about Clinton if she became president and nominated judges who favored gun restrictions. The Trump campaign later said he only meant to increase political engagement, not incite violence. Warren disagreed. ""Trump has repeatedly invited his supporters to commit a horrific act of violence against his opponent, against another human being,"" Warren said. ""What kind of a man does that? A bully. A twisted bully who can't fight his own fights."" Warren has been an attack dog of sorts for Clinton ever since she clinched the Democratic nomination, and the real estate mogul has hit back. Trump goes so far as to refer to Warren as ""Pocahontas,"" a reference to her claims of Native American heritage. Warren was but one of many Clinton surrogates hitting the trail in support of her this week. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who, like Warren, appeals to younger and more liberal voters, made two appearances in Ohio on Saturday. ",1,0,0
1164,"President Barack Obama on Thursday stressed the need for a ""thoughtful"" and ""peaceful"" resolution in Charlotte, in his first comments addressing three days of protests over the fatal police shooting of an African-American man. “The way we change the system requires to be able to reach out and engage the broader American community and that requires being peaceful, that requires being thoughtful about what are the specific reforms you're looking for,” Obama told ABC in an interview at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Story Continued Below Obama emphasized that while some have resorted to violence in recent days, many more are responding to tragedies ""the right way."" “[The] overwhelming majority of people who have been concerned about police-community relations [are] doing it the right way,” he said. “Every once in a while you see folks doing it the wrong way.” The events following Monday's shooting have reignited a national debate about police and race relations. After two nights of protests grew increasingly violent in Charlotte, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency Wednesday in an attempt to ease tensions. Forty-four arrests were made in that span, with numerous injuries sustained by police officers and one protester fatally wounded in a civilian shooting. Obama also addressed the growing sentiment of injustice felt by many in the African-American community in the wake of another fatal shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “I think it's important to separate out the pervasive sense of frustration among a lot of African Americans about shootings of people and the sense that justice is not always color blind,” he said. According to the White House President Obama has spoken over the phone to Charlotte mayor Jennifer Roberts as well as McCrory to express his condolences and offer any further federal assistance.",1,0,0

With all of the pain that Americans are facing with the riots and the hatred of men and women who are sworn to protect the public, we at Right Wing News are dedicated to balancing out the seemingly endless stream of anger.  Mark Ross wasn’t shy about admitting that he disliked police officers, but when a tragic event struck his family, an officer turned out to be the best friend he’d never expected to have. You see, Ross received a phone call that nobody ever wants to get; the call telling him that his sister had passed away after getting into a car accident. Doing what any of the rest of us would do, he hopped into a car with his friend at the wheel and they sped toward Detroit. While passing through Ohio, they were pulled over for speeding. The driver was taken to the local jail and the car was impounded. So what happened to Ross? He began explaining to the officer the reason for the traffic infraction. As he told the officer about the loss of his sister, he broke into tears and began sobbing. Instead of leaving him on the side of the road, or taking him to the closest bus stop, the officer decided to do what he knew was right. The officer reached out to Ross and prayed for him and his family. He also drove him 100 miles to the prison where his friend was being held so he could get bailed out, and to get Ross closer to Michigan. Ross posted the above photo on his Facebook page with the following message: At 3am I got a phone call stating that my sister had been killed in a car accident due to some young dumb punk! I haven’t slept and instantly got on the road. Of course we were speeding, trying to get back to Detroit. And we got pulled over in Ohio. I knew I was going to Jail due to a petty warrant. The police called Wayne county and they refused to come get me because of the distance. I explained to the officer that my sister had died and that I needed to get to my mother asap. I broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry. He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY. He offered to bring me 100 miles further to Detroit because they towed the vehicle. Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops but I am truly Greatful for this Guy. He gave me hope A GoFundMe has been set up to help pay for his sister’s funeral expenses.

1316,"Politico POLITICO's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington Good morning from Hempstead, New York. The general consensus is this: Donald Trump didn’t throw up on his shoes. But Hillary Clinton had the far better night in their first 90-minute (it actually lasted 95 minutes) matchup here at Hofstra University on Long Island. Clinton mostly kept her cool -- as did Trump for the first portion of the evening. Trump ended up citing Sid Blumenthal, Rosie O’Donnell and referring viewers to Sean Hannity to vouch for his opposition to the Iraq War. The pre-debate buzz among reporters here was that Trump left himself the option to come to the spin room, but would only show up if he needed to change the narrative. He came to the spin room, and then spoke to Hannity live from the press filing center. Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) pointed out that “she can’t remember last time, if ever, a general election candidate went to the spin room.” Not a good sign for Trump. LAST NIGHT Hillary Clinton ended the debate by saying, “And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name...Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this November."" Story Continued Below THIS MORNING Donald Trump went on “Fox and Friends” and said Machado was “the worst” contestant they had and chided her for gaining weight. “She was impossible...She was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem...This was many years ago, and [Clinton] found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.” Video clip http://bit.ly/2cA06xi (h/t Alex Burns) **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX --WHAT’S NEXT: The next presidential debate -- in St. Louis on Oct. 9 -- gives Trump an opportunity to bounce back. Remember: Mitt Romney trounced Barack Obama in the first debate. But the second event, which will be held at Wash. U., is a town hall, which brings its own challenges for both candidates. Clinton mostly skated on some of Trump’s signature attacks: Benghazi, her private email server, the FBI investigation, immigration and the Clinton Foundation. Trump is certain to hammer away on those issues in the coming weeks, and try to inject them into the conversation in Missouri. The vice presidential debate is in Farmville, Virginia, on Oct. 4 -- one week from today. WHAT TO WATCH FOR: How the down-ballot candidates react. Top Republican operatives running Senate and House races say they weren’t thrilled, but they don’t know that Trump’s bad night moves the needle. The early take is that Trump was stable for the first 30 minutes, which gives Republicans hope that any negative impact will be limited. 42 DAYS until Election Day. The government shuts down Friday. THE NARRATIVE -- “Clinton set the trap and Trump walked in: The Democrat dominated the debate. Will it matter?” by Eli Stokols: “‘Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit,’ Clinton started. ‘He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.’ Trump quickly dismissed Clinton’s characterization, saying he received ‘a very small loan’ that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. ‘I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.’ In the moment, he seemed calm—but from that point forward he was anything but. ‘She mind-screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,’ said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative in California. ‘That was brilliant psychological warfare on her part. He slowly unwound from there, culminating in borderline incoherency over the final 30 minutes.’” http://politi.co/2cynqH0 JMART and PAT HEALY on A1 of the NYT, “CANDIDATES PRESS POINTED ATTACKS IN ACERBIC DEBATE -- Trump Raps Clinton on Trade and Email -- She Counters on His Fitness”: “In a relentlessly antagonistic debate, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over trade, the Iraq war, his refusal to release his tax returns and her use of a private email server, with Mr. Trump frequently showing impatience and political inexperience as Mrs. Clinton pushed him to defend his past denigration of women and President Obama. Mr. Trump repeatedly interrupted Mrs. Clinton and at times talked over her throughout the 90-minute debate, making slashing attacks that surely pleased his Republican base but may have been off-putting to women and undecided voters. He also left unchallenged her assertion that he paid no federal taxes for years.” http://nyti.ms/2cyicen … A1 PDF http://nyti.ms/2cZMY2O --WaPo leadall by Phil Rucker and Anne Gearan: “Donald Trump unrelentingly blamed the nation’s chronic problems on ‘typical politician’ Hillary Clinton, yet he found himself mostly on the defensive in their first debate here Monday night as she denounced him for racial insensitivity, hiding potential conflicts of interest and ‘stiffing’ those who helped build his business empire … Trump … spent much of the evening explaining himself — over his temperament, treatment of women and minorities, business practices and readiness to be commander in chief, as well as over his long perpetuation of a falsehood about Barack Obama’s birthplace to delegitimize his presidency. ‘He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior, and the birther lie was a very hurtful one,’ said Clinton ... ‘Barack Obama is a man of great dignity, and I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.’ Trump, who earlier this month at last acknowledged Obama’s birth in Hawaii, replied by invoking Clinton’s 2008 rivalry with Obama: ‘When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work.’” http://wapo.st/2dokMt5 FOR REFERENCE -- The full transcript http://politi.co/2doh9Dw GOTHAM WATCH -- N.Y.

Trump is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most … What about the Clinton Foundation? The former secretary's debate team … expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her family's foundation. They were worried about it. While he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. His ‘30 years’ attack worked - and he’ll use it again … [T]here were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra - the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) on Clinton’s effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life … “Clinton effectively attacked his business career … Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents: Trump’s failure to turn over his tax returns. Clinton went there with a vengeance – engaging in a little Trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality TV star … Her most effective attack - and his worst answer.

783,"One of the biggest problems in arming the so-called “moderate” Syrian rebels to fight ISIS is that we truly don’t know who the moderates are. Just think of post cases where we’ve armed insurgents, such as the Mujahideen during the Cold War to fight the Russians – only to have many of them later morph into Al-Qaeda and The Taliban.  The same is true of the so-called moderates in Syria. A video went viral last month of one such “moderate” group of rebels beheading a 12 year old boy, which I won’t link to for obvious reasons – and how many other groups have members who would do the same? Most of the dozens of groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War have some sort of ideological motivation, and even “moderate” Muslims could change their tune when they have the power to influence government. It’s too late now though, as the House voted to arm Syrian rebels back in 2014, and John McCain was a huge proponent of it. And how is that working out? Let’s take a peak… As WeaselZippers reported: Video footage appears to show US commandos fleeing a Syrian town under a barrage of abuse and insults hurled at them by fighters from the American-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group. The video appears to be the first evidence of US special forces cooperating with Turkish troops in their battle against Islamic State (Isil). The incident illustrates the complex web of alliances and enmities in Syria, where many of America’s allies are fighting each other and some rebel groups that receive US support still harbour strong anti-American sentiments. The footage shows a crowd of rebel fighters in the town of al-Rai near the Turkish border, which was captured from Isil by Syrian rebel groups with the backing of Turkey. Turkey, which launched a military incursion into Syria in late August, has been backing the FSA. The fighters scream anti-American chants as a column of pick-up trucks carrying US commandos drives away from them. “Christians and Americans have no place among us,” shouts one man in the video. “They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria.” Another man calls out: “The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs. They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam. ” The US troops are not wearing traditional uniform but they carry American weapons and are wearing the distinctive round helmets favoured by US special forces. Two days ago, the U.S. admitted that we may have possibly accidentally bombed Syrian forces in an airstrike that was meant for ISIS. However, when Syrian forces (who are supposed to be our allies) are threatening us, could that strike have been intentional, and we just claimed it was meant for ISIS as cover up? Just when you thought the Syrian Civil War couldn’t get even more complicated, it did. ",0,0,1

447,"(CNN)A federal appeals court ruled Friday that Ohio's method of removing names from its voter rolls violates federal law, and sent the case back to the district court for a remedy. The ruling by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and other groups who had argued the program violated the National Voter Registration Act and expressed concern that the purge would effect ""many thousands"" of Ohio voters. They hope the lower court will move quickly to direct that names that were improperly removed should be put back on the voting list or that voters not on the list be allowed to file a provisional ballot. The appeals court said that Ohio's so-called ""Supplemental Process,"" where ""a voter is purged from the rolls after six years of inactivity -- even if he or she did not move and otherwise remains eligible to vote,"" is in violation of the NVRA. ""We are very happy that the court found that (Secretary of State Jon Husted's) process of purging voters in Ohio is illegal and must stop,"" Mike Brickner, Senior Policy Director at the ACLU, said in a statement. ""We don't believe that any voters should be removed from the rolls simply because they haven't voted in a few elections."" Friday's ruling reverses a district court ruling that had gone in favor of Secretary of State Jon Husted. The lower court had held that Ohio's ""public interest is being served"" and that the ""procedures of maintaining the voter registration rolls ensure the integrity of the election process. "" In a statement, Husted said the ruling ""overturns 20 years of Ohio law and practice, which has been carried out by the last four secretaries of state, both democrat and republican."" He questioned how the lower court -- charged with finding an appropriate remedy -- will proceed. ""It is one thing to strike down a longstanding procedure; it is another to craft a workable remedy. To that end, if the final resolution requires us to reinstate voting eligibility to individuals who have died or moved out of Ohio, we will appeal."" ",1,0,0
411,"Washington (CNN)A congressman who represents North Carolina apologized Thursday for saying there are riots in Charlotte because the protesters ""hate white people.""

Robert Pittenger, a Republican, said on the BBC's ""Newsnight."" ""I mean, yes, it is, it is a welfare state. We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, where we put people in bondage so that they cannot be all that they're capable of being."" Pittenger, who has represented North Carolina's ninth congressional district since 2013, emphasized that people come to the United States for opportunities, not government handouts.

""It didn't become that way because of a great government who provided everything for everyone, no."" Pittenger told CNN's Don Lemon on ""CNN Tonight"" Thursday that he was repeating comments he'd heard from protesters. ""Frankly, I was quoting what they were saying last night on what I observed on your network. And their hatred for white people,"" Pittenger said. ""And that saddens me greatly."" ""You believe the protesters hate white people?"" Lemon asked. ""No, no, sir. It's the comment that they made. I think you can go back and look at the tapes. The comments that they made on air,"" Pittenger responded. ""You mean the protesters made on air?"" Lemon asked. ""Yes sir. I was only trying to convey what they were saying and yet, it didn't come out right, and I apologize. I have many, many good friends in the African-American community,"" he said. Pittenger's office also released a statement apologizing for comments, saying he didn't mean to offend anyone. ""What is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart. My anguish led me to respond to a reporter's question in a way that I regret,"" he said in the statement. ""The answer doesn't reflect who I am. I was quoting statements made by angry protesters last night on national TV. My intent was to discuss the lack of economic mobility for African-Americans because of failed policies. I apologize to those I offended and hope we can bring peace and calm to Charlotte."" On Tuesday in Charlotte, Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American, was shot by a police officer after refusing repeated demands to put down what authorities said was a gun. Riots and protests in the city began that night and continued on Wednesday and Thursday nights. President Barack Obama weighed in on the unrest Thursday, saying that the anger should be directed toward pushing needed reforms. ",1,0,0
947,"With just 50 days until the election, Donald Trump is facing a staggering — and perhaps historic — organizational disadvantage. According to a POLITICO review of campaign spending, Hillary Clinton has invested seven times the amount of money on TV commercials as her Republican rival and has established twice as many field offices in many of the states that will decide who wins the presidency. In many battlegrounds, she has dozens more organizers than Trump. Story Continued Below While Trump, a first-time politician who has surrounded himself with advisers who are new to the rigors of presidential campaigns, has made serious headway in a number of battlegrounds in recent days, his on-the-ground and in-the-air deficits could be what stands between him and 270 electoral votes. “We’re in completely untested waters,” said David Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican operative who is leading a study group at the Harvard Institute of Politics contrasting the traditional campaign approach adopted by Clinton with the non-traditional one being used by Trump. “There has never been such a wide disparity in resource allocation as we're seeing in 2016.” The question, though, may be whether Trump’s lack of infrastructure matters in an election cycle that has so far rewarded a low-budget approach built on free media and mass rallies rather than TV ads and door-knocking. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, sent an email to a group of top Trump advisers, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, TV ad maker Larry Weitzner, and senior communications adviser Jason Miller, briefing them on the latest in commercial spending. The numbers were startling. As of Sept. 12, the email noted, Trump had spent $17 million on TV ads, a small fraction of the $126 million Clinton had invested. When outside groups were added to the mix, Trump’s deficit was even greater -- $33 million to Clinton’s $244 million. Trump aides say the figures reflect a simple reality: Their funds are limited. Through the end of July, Clinton and her outside group allies had raised a combined $435 million to Trump’s $160 million – a difference of more than two-to-one, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Unlike Clinton, a powerful fundraiser, Trump has struggled to attract the support of deep-pocketed donors, many of whom have been repelled by his candidacy. Those working for pro-Trump super PACs are racing to find a solution. Advisers to one of the groups, Rebuilding America Now, are openly discussing the possibility that Rick Scott, the wealthy Florida governor who is chairing the super PAC, may soon provide it with a contribution. Clinton has used her TV barrage to cast her Republican opponent as a dangerous, unpredictable figure who’s ill-suited suited to occupy the Oval Office. Last week, while Trump aired commercials in just four states, Clinton had spots running in nine battlegrounds. One Clinton ad that went into heavy rotation, titled “Sacrifice,” spotlighted critical comments Trump made about Arizona Sen. John McCain’s war record. Strategists from both parties say they cannot recall the last time a presidential nominee has been so dominated on the TV airwaves. The seven-to-one ratio confronting Trump far eclipses the five-to-four margin President Barack Obama faced in 2012 and the two-to-one ratio McCain encountered in 2008. With early voting in some battlegrounds opening in just days, the race is entering its most intense phase yet. And while Clinton has established formidable operations in many key states, Trump has far fewer full-time staffers to get out the vote, according to figures provided by campaign aides, national party officials, and swing-state operatives. In must-win Ohio, where early voting begins on Oct. 12, Clinton has around 250 organizers and 50 offices. Trump, meanwhile, has roughly 110 staffers and 30 offices. Republicans say Gov. John Kasich’s persistent refusal to endorse Trump has hurt the nominee, depriving him of man-power. Many of Kasich’s longest-serving aides, including Jeffrey Polesovsky and Jai Chabria, have decided to sit on the sidelines. Chabria, a former Kasich senior adviser, said Trump was behind in a state where appealing to low-propensity voters was a weeks-long process that couldn’t be done overnight. “It’s a very late effort by the Trump folks to play catch up, and the Democrats and the Clinton campaign have been here for a long time. That’s going to have an effect,” he said. “Big rallies are really nice, but actual campaigns matter in Ohio.” In North Carolina, where Trump has around 170 staffers and 10 offices, Clinton has over 250 workers and 30 offices. Democrats say they are implementing a detailed plan aimed at intensifying turnout among black and college-educated voters, demographic groups that Trump has struggled with. Last month, Clinton brought aboard Dan Kanninen, who played a key role in Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, to help oversee her campaign in the state. In New Hampshire, it’s a similar story. While Trump has fewer than 50 full-time organizers and just a handful of offices, Clinton has around 100 staffers and 25 offices. “Two months out, I think Hillary has a stronger operation than Trump up here. That’s pretty apparent from the number of staff, the number of offices, and the number commercials,” said Jim Merrill, a veteran Republican strategist who oversaw Marco Rubio’s primary bid in New Hampshire and held similar positions on Mitt Romney’s two presidential campaigns. “Trump is behind where we were in 2012.” In even conservative bastions, Clinton is developing formidable infrastructure. In Arizona, Clinton has around 160 staffers and 25 offices, and in Georgia she has roughly 40 organizers and 10 offices. In that state, Tracey Lewis, who worked on Michelle Nunn's 2014 Georgia Senate bid, recently signed on as a senior advisor. Republicans declined to detail their numbers in the two conservative states but acknowledged that Clinton had a bigger field presence. While Trump advisers concede they’re behind in the ground war, they insist they’re making serious gains. The campaign, for example, said it had improved its footing in Florida after engineering a recent staff shuffle. State director Karen Giorno, who’d clashed with many members of the Trump team, was replaced with Susie Wiles, a former top adviser to Scott, the Florida governor. Yet in an election that’s so far been driven by daily headlines, some are wondering if textbook campaign metrics like TV ads and field staffers will matter as much as they have in previous years. Some are coming to the conclusion that the New York businessman’s lack of swing-state infrastructure might not be fatal. Throughout his campaign, Trump has invested relatively little on TV ads and field deployment – instead surviving off his ability to pack rallies and generate overwhelming media attention for speeches and statements large and small. On Thursday morning, during a meeting convened by Trump’s congressional supporters on Capitol Hill, Conway said the Republican nominee would give multiple addresses each week focusing on specific policies he’d implement as president. “The fact that the numbers have moved gradually in Trump’s favor in spite of the onslaught of spending by Hillary causes a lot of head-scratching,” said Kochel, who was chief strategist on Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. “But the voters are getting their information in a thousand different ways outside of the campaigns’ control.”",1,0,0
1024,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf at a public hearing Tuesday he should resign in the wake of an unauthorized customer-account scandal, return the money he made while the activity went on, and face a Justice Department investigation for possible criminality. ""It's gutless leadership,"" Warren said of Stumpf's response to revelations that the bank opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' permission. Story Continued Below The Massachusetts Democrat used the closely watched Senate Banking Committee hearing to make her case that the United States needs ""tough new laws"" to hold corporate executives personally accountable. Stumpf left senators dissatisfied with comments that he would have no responsibility in clawing back top officials' pay. He deferred to the rest of the bank's board when it came to questions about decisions involving compensation for executives. ""That's unfortunate,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the panel's top-ranking Democrat. Senators have urged Stumpf to revoke money from retiring consumer banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who is reportedly leaving the company with $125 million in stocks and options. Stumpf said he was not involved with compensation discussions at the board level. Though he is the board chairman, he does not sit on the Human Resources Committee responsible for overseeing executive pay. ""To not invoke some degree of clawback for yourself and others involved would be committing malpractice from the standpoint of just public relations,"" Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said. Senators from both parties suggested that Wells Fargo might have violated SEC rules. Warren said the agency should also investigate Stumpf. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican running for reelection in Pennsylvania, told Stumpf that he had been unable to find Wells Fargo disclosing potential material risks to investors related to the scandal. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) said the SEC should investigate whether Wells Fargo violated internal control provisions in the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act by not recognizing and stopping widespread fraud. In an attempt to illustrate what she said was Stumpf's personal gain from the unauthorized account openings, Warren said Wells Fargo shares held by Stumpf during the period of the scam grew in value by more than $200 million. ""If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the cash drawer they’d probably be looking at criminal charges for theft,"" she said. ""They could end up in prison. But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket."" Stumpf, responding to criticism from Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), said,""If I could turn the clock back, and I’ve thought about this a thousand times, of course we all wish we would have done something more earlier. We didn’t get on this fast enough.""",1,0,0

91,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence. But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl. Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week. “I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.   She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children. “It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said. Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting. Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.   The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees. At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney. After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center. “Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.   Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News. Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",1,0,0
1249,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night’s big debate: Don’t let Donald Trump get away with it. And Trump’s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton’s team is just trying to “game the refs.” Story Continued Below The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton’s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a “dead heat.” “The latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,” Silver tweeted. During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton’s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time. “We are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told “CBS This Morning,” adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, “that that simply be checked.” “The thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC. But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump’s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he’s a Democrat and the system is “very unfair.” The “NBC Nightly News” anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003. “I don’t know that he knew what Lester Holt’s voter registration was,” said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. “He didn’t lie,” Conway said at one point, explaining that “a lie would mean that he knew the man’s party registration.” In a presidential cycle that’s seen endless debates about debates, Monday’s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn’t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee. But Clinton’s campaign has beat up on Holt’s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump’s false assertion that he didn’t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month. The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. “In our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,” Janet Brown, the commission’s executive director, told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.” When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, “I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.” For her part, Clinton won’t let Trump’s lies “go by the wayside,” press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn’t, either. “There is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,” he said. “Lester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates’ performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can’t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.” Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern. “I think what the concern is from both of the campaigns — and what it should be — is that the moderator is not the person who’s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,” he said. “You can hold people accountable, there’s no question, but I don’t think it’s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they’re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.” Trump’s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp’s preparation for two Trumps. “We don’t want Donald Trump’s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We’re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,” Mook told NBC’s “Today.” Asked about Clinton’s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that “it just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don’t know that.” But Conway shot down the notion that there’s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is “to become human” during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that “Overprogramming leads to short circuits,” and Conway joined the pile-on. “He’s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,” Conway said. “And that’s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven’t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.” After Mook warned against “a double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,” Conway added that the two campaign managers “are living in parallel universes.” “I mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it’s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,” she said. “I'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn’t necessarily been beneficial.” Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton’s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns. “I’m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they’re conclusions in search of evidence,” Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate. “What I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,” Conway said. “Ninety-two percent of at least two of our embeds’ tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can’t get a fair shake from certain people.” Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul’s performance. “So if she ends up saying to him, ‘That’s just not true, you’re distorting my record, you’re being mean to a woman,’ and then people will say, ‘He was mean to a woman,’ and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up — even if it’s not true,” she said. “So that would be my concern, that he’s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she’s not a great debater, that she’s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she’s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.” Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself — and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise. ""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be — he's just going to be like you see him on — when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""",1,0,0
1250,"Bloomberg TV will conduct on-screen fact checks of statements made by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during Monday night’s debate, POLITICO has confirmed. The channel’s decision to conduct an on-screen fact-check sets Bloomberg apart from the other major TV networks, none of whom have committed to doing on-screen fact checks during the debate. Most will leave the fact-checking to segments in the post-debate analysis coverage. Clinton’s supporters have called for aggressive fact-checking during Monday’s debate, saying that members of the media have failed to adequately fact-check and correct falsehoods from her Republican rival. NBC’s Matt Lauer was recently criticized for not correcting several false statements from Trump during a presidential forum on the network. Spokespeople for the networks told POLITICO that on-screen fact checks would be hard to execute in real-time, which is why they were opting out. That leaves the real-time fact-checking up to NBC’s Lester Holt, the debate moderator, or the candidates themselves.

What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source?

Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win. Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads. (For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.) And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in. Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

This is the woman who claims transparency and as has never lied. In a recent report from the liberal leaning New York Times, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman M.D. brings it all out into the open. The doctor also makes sure to point out that what was released by Trump was not extensive enough too. Read the story below.  As Written By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. for the New York Times: The disclosure last week that Hillary Clinton was beingtreated for pneumonia thrust the health of both of the major parties’ presidential candidates and their running mates to the center of the campaign, and led to the release of more detailed medical histories from the two candidates seeking what is widely regarded as the world’s most demanding job. Mrs. Clinton, 68, the Democratic presidential nominee, who has had serious medical problems in recent years, released on Wednesday an update of a July 2015 letter from her doctor attesting to her overall good health and ability to serve a full four-year term as president. However, the doctor, Dr. Lisa Bardack of Mt. Kisco, N.Y., noted that Mrs. Clinton had developed two new medical conditions in 2016: a sinus and ear infection in the winter and pneumonia this month. Dr. Bardack wrote that she had regularly examined Mrs. Clinton this year for routine care and that she had been closely monitoring her pneumonia, which is improving. But doctors not connected with the candidate’s care say that the letters omit basic information like height and weight, and that a more detailed history of her blood clots and a 2012 concussion should be disclosed.

259,"Washington (CNN)A group of former national security officials and experts are calling on Donald Trump to disclose his overseas business dealings, questioning whether the Republican nominee has conflicts of interest with US foreign policy. More than 50 past officials signed the letter released Monday, a mix of Democratic and Republican national security leaders. The letter notes that Trump's business dealings overseas could pose ""unprecedented"" and ""significant conflicts of interest"" if he guided US foreign policy. It demands Trump disclose in full what his foreign business interests are, and to promise to divest himself of them if he wins in November. Global leaders meet at UN ""Our next commander-in-chief will inherit complex national security threats and complicated relationships with allies and adversaries alike,"" the officials wrote. ""But our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America's best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets."" Signatories include Hillary Clinton supporters like retired Gen. John Allen and former Defense Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy. Also signing were a number of former George W. Bush administration officials, including former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, former national security adviser Robert Blackwill, former Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis Thomas Fingar and former acting CIA Director John E. McLaughlin. The letter shares some overlap with a missive from a group of 50 GOP national security officials who last month wrote a letter opposing the Republican candidate. 50 GOP national security officials oppose Trump Trump has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit, and has given limited information about his businesses to the public. He has said he will separate himself from the business if he became president, leaving it in charge of his children.

1621,"The Bloomberg network will run a live, on-screen fact check during tonight’s presidential debate, breaking precedent with other networks. Politico reported Monday morning that Bloomberg would be verifying the factual accuracy of statements by both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump in real time on the screen. Other networks have opted out of doing a live fact check, mostly because it would be too difficult. The Clinton campaign has called repeatedly for a live fact check of the debate in anticipation of Trump’s penchant for making unverifiable claims on live TV. “For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage,” said Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri in a conference call with reporters. “We do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time.” This would largely leave it up to moderator Lester Holt to call out each candidate when making a false statement. However, this could prove too controversial for Holt, who would invite criticism much in the same way CNN’s Candy Crowley did in 2012, when she interrupted Mitt Romney on the topic of the Banghazi attacks while moderating a debate between Romney and President Barack Obama. However, not correcting a candidate when he or she misstates the facts can also stir up controversy. The most recentl example of that is Today Show anchor Matt Lauer choosing not to interject during one of Donald Trump’s responses to his questions, when the GOP nominee said he never supported the Iraq War (he did). And while networks have said they would fact-check each candidates’ statements in followup pieces to run the following day, it still essentially frees up both candidates to lie without being interrupted.

1084,"Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump in the nation’s smallest battleground state, according to a new Monmouth University poll of likely voters in New Hampshire released on Wednesday. The poll, which was conducted last Saturday through Tuesday, shows Clinton with a 9-point advantage over Trump, 47 percent to 38 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson is at 10 percent, Green Party nominee Jill Stein garners 1 percent, and another 3 percent of likely voters are undecided. New Hampshire will only award 4 electoral votes this fall. But the state has outsized importance in the battle for the Senate, and the Monmouth poll shows incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte with a slim, 2-point lead over her Democratic challenger, popular Gov. Maggie Hassan, 47 percent to 45 percent. That is well within the poll’s margin of error: plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. And Republicans also have an early lead in the governor’s race, after both parties selected their nominees in last week’s primaries. Republican Chris Sununu leads his relatively unknown Democratic opponent, Colin Van Ostern, 49 percent to 43 percent. In the presidential race, Clinton leads Trump because more Democrats (94 percent) have lined up behind the former secretary of state than Republicans (85 percent) who are supporting Trump. Clinton also leads among independents, 42 percent to 35 percent. Neither Clinton nor Trump is popular, but Trump’s negatives outweigh Clinton’s. Thirty-six percent of likely voters have a favorable opinion of Clinton, while 56 percent view her unfavorably. Trump’s favorable rating is lower: 30 percent favorable, compared to 63 percent unfavorable. It's another in a series of polls this week that show Clinton regaining some momentum after losing ground last week amid the fallout of her ""basket of deplorables"" comment and pneumonia diagnosis. Monmouth has also showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points in vote-rich Florida, and within striking distance in Georgia, which has been reliably Republican in recent elections. Both candidates in the Senate race are well liked: Half of likely voters approve of how Ayotte is handling her job as senator, and 38 percent disapprove. Hassan’s approval rating is even higher: Sixty percent approve of the second-term governor’s job performance, and only 31 percent disapprove. Neither candidate in the gubernatorial race is well known, but Sununu — whose father, John, served three terms as governor in the 1980s, and brother, also named John, served a term in the Senate last decade — has higher name ID.

It was up to his wife to fix it. So on Sunday, January 26, 1992, on 60 Minutes on CBS, in a time slot immediately following the Super Bowl, Hillary Clinton responded fiercely to questions about her husband’s reported infidelity and the nature of their marriage—by invoking the name of a country music star. “You know, I’m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,” she said, wearing gold earrings and a black headband, perched next to him on a couch in a hotel suite in Boston and waving her clenched right hand. “I’m sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honor what he’s been through and what we’ve been through together. And you know, if that’s not enough for people, then heck—don’t vote for him.” Story Continued Below This was America’s introduction to Hillary Clinton, and it worked—for her husband. What she did on 60 Minutes saved his candidacy and his political career. Most agree he would not have become president without it. For her, however, it came at a steep cost. In 10 minutes of television, she projected a set of complicated, even conflicting images—forthright but defensive, feisty but dutiful—triggering the mix of skeptical, antagonistic feelings that have defined her with a share of the American public ever since. Now, as she gets closer to the presidency than any woman ever has, she is struggling with unfavorable ratings that would be historically high if it weren’t for her opponent’s being even higher. There are substantive reasons, as with any politician with a long public record, but underlying them are the same frictions that came to the fore in that 60 Minutes interview—sentiments that, fair or not, have grown only more pronounced with Clinton’s perennial, awkward and generally unsuccessful efforts to re-introduce herself, to redefine herself. It didn’t have to be this way. Some of her key staffers from the ’92 campaign said in interviews with Politico that they feel deep, lasting regret about this legacy. There was so much to work with, they explained—her education reform, her advocacy for children, her role as a mother, as opposed to the harder, more threatening persona of an ambitious corporate attorney or do-anything operator—and yet “there was little strategic thought given to how to present her to a broader audience,” according to Richard Mintz, her staff director during that campaign. This, he and others said, was because of time constraints, and because the Clinton bid early on was seen as a long shot, and because everybody was understandably more worried about how to package him, not her, and because staffers saw her as so intelligent and capable that it didn’t dawn on them that she would need political help herself. In retrospect, though, there was one chance to help her make a first impression, they said. And they blew it. “It’s one of the great regrets, seriously, of my life,” Mintz said. “Certainly I feel like we could have done, and should have done, a better job. There is a lot of regret in me,” said Patti Solis Doyle, the veteran political strategist who was a young senior adviser to Hillary Clinton in that campaign. “There was never any, ‘Oh, Hillary could be a problem …” There was, though, a problem—albeit one that wouldn’t be fully understood for years to come. Because of the dire circumstances under which she was forced to enter the national glare, the enduring paradox of Hillary Clinton was cemented before the Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins had flown home. The appearance on 60 Minutes amounted to a mandate to come off strong enough to help him but not so strong as to hurt him, an almost impossible balancing act. Even as she was putting up an effective unified front, she was presenting to an estimated 50 million viewers a tangle of contradictions. She wanted to show her independence—a quality that ended up alienating a whole set of traditionalist voters—but she was standing by her man—a decision that still today alienates younger people who see it as a kind of surrender. She had her own career, but she was also the “wife of.” It was a continuation of the fundamental tension that had underscored her almost two decades living in Arkansas—but now this knotty push-pull was laid bare in the harshest of national spotlights. That image of an assertive, outspoken woman was reinforced seven weeks later when on March 16, 1992, she responded to questions about the appearance of conflicts of interest between her work as a partner at one of the most prestigious law firms in Arkansas and her husband’s position as the governor of the state by unleashing a headstrong remark many women found insulting. “I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,” Clinton snapped to reporters at a restaurant called the Busy Bee during a campaign stop in Chicago, “but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.” These two sound-bite snapshots and the time between turned Clinton into a Rorschach test through which people from coast to coast wrestled with a woman’s role at home, at work and in politics. She became a contentious issue in the coverage of the campaign, which led to a too-little, too-late effort to amend the approach and “soften” the look of the highest-profile surrogate, which led to the initial round of discussion in the national media about who she “really” was and whether her marriage was true love or a calculating political partnership. Here heading into the last month and a half of this mad, hinge-of-history election, and as Clinton prepares for another high-stakes TV moment—the hotly anticipated first debate against Donald Trump—her former staffers and longtime friends can’t help but look back to the 60 Minutes interview and the comment about “cookies” and “teas” and see the unmistakable roots of her penchant for stilted caution and the public’s implacable suspicions. “Boy,” said Nancy Wanderer, who’s been friends with Clinton since they were classmates at Wellesley College. “Two short little sentences that packed a lot of punch. … I just said the other day, ‘When did this business start, when people began to not like her, not trust her?’ And I think it’s the 60 Minutes interview.” “There was this way of seeing her in a certain light,” said Jan Piercy, another close friend from Wellesley, “that she couldn’t shake.” “The great tragedy is that we lost the thread that was at her core,” said Mintz, her staff director. “It’s probably one of the great political missed opportunities of all time.” *** He always needed her more than she needed him. “Hillary doesn’t have to stay with Bill Clinton,” her friend Linda Bloodworth-Thomason said in 1992. “She could get to the Senate or possibly the White House on her own—and she knows it.” “She had more choices than any woman in America,” her friend Susan Thomases said the same year. “But she chose this and chose to make her life with him.” And the choice was forged from an essential compromise: A whip-smart, aggressive, Yale-prepared attorney, she had left behind opportunities in East Coast power cities and moved to rural, out-of-the-way Arkansas to marry one of the most promising political talents of her generation. Her almost two decades in the state spooled out as a series of assertions of independence—rural health care reform, state education reform, helping to start the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and the state’s first neonatal nursery, national recognition for her work as a lawyer, seats on boards—but also concessions. She did corporate law, which wasn’t her passion, instead of children and family law, which was, because it allowed her to be a better provider—to make a salary three to four times what her husband made as the governor. She took off her glasses and put in contact lenses. She changed her hair. She changed her clothes. She changed her name. For her own career, she wanted to be Hillary Rodham. For her husband’s career, she had to be Hillary Clinton. “I think that people who are married to politicians are under a tremendous strain,” Clinton said back in 1979, in an interview on local TV weeks into her time as the wife of a governor, “because unless you have a pretty strong sense of your own self-identity, it becomes very easy to be buffeted about by all the people who are around your husband.” “She had to do this, she had to do that—and she acquiesced,” said Ann Henry of Fayetteville, who’s been her friend for more than 40 years. “Because that’s what they wanted her to do, OK? That’s what Arkansas wanted her to do!” “I said, ‘Hey, wait a minute, this is the woman that rose to the top at Wellesley, that was president of our college government, because we thought she was so competent and intelligent,’” Wanderer said. “The person she was,” Wanderer said, “wasn’t going to be acceptable down there. It was a huge sacrifice.” The sacrifices continued. The fall before the 60 Minutes interview, in a trip to Chicago shortly after her husband had announced his presidential candidacy, she spent a night with Piercy, another college friend. “She said to me, ‘You know, Bill’s been attorney general and governor, and we’ve been in the public eye for years now—but there’s something that’s absolutely a different universe when you step into this running for the presidency,’” Piercy said. “It really was a moment of stepping across a line, and it worried her.” Two events introduced her to the nation, cementing an image of her in place in voters’ minds. It is only with the benefit of hindsight, of course, that everybody agrees Bill Clinton wouldn’t have been president without what Hillary Clinton did on January 26, 1992. It took a second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary some three weeks later, after which he practically declared victory by dubbing himself “the Comeback Kid.” It took a faltering economy. It took a vulnerable incumbent in George H.W. Bush. It took, in the end, a win in November that made him the 42nd president of the United States. He hadn’t announced he was running until October of the previous year, and in those first few months, another former staffer said in an interview, “the campaign leadership was focused on Bill Clinton and had not yet fully considered Hillary’s role.” But all of a sudden, with the eruption of the Flowers story, it couldn’t have been more clear: “We bet a whole campaign on a single interview,” communications director George Stephanopoulos would write in his memoir—and Hillary Clinton, not Bill Clinton, was by far the most critical cog. “We were under pressure from the stories that had been printed in the trash tabloid,” campaign chairman Mickey Kantor said in an interview. “We thought the best person to address these, of anybody, was her.” As top strategist James Carville would say later: “No her, no go.” “Did she want to do that interview,” Doyle said. “Abso-frickin’-lutely not. This was survival. She was going to fight. She was fighting for her husband, for herself, for their political careers.” So in the post-Super Bowl interview on CBS, Hillary Clinton used the phrase “zone of privacy,” and he “acknowledged wrongdoing” and “causing pain in my marriage” but stopped short of an outright denial he couldn’t give without lying. But what elicited what became the most unforgettable comment from either one of them was a question from 60 Minutes’ Steve Kroft in which he expressed the notion that their marriage was “an understanding,” “an arrangement.” “Wait a minute,” Bill Clinton said. “You’re looking at two people who love each other. This is not an arrangement or an understanding. This is a marriage.” At which point Hillary Clinton piped up and said what she said about Tammy Wynette. “I wish I had let him have the last word,” she would write a little more than a decade later. Still, at the time, what came across on the screen, at least to her friends all over the country, was … authentically her. “That was my friend,” said Little Rock’s Skip Rutherford, who watched at a Super Bowl party turned Clinton viewing. “That was my friend Hillary.” *** She called Doyle the night it aired. “She called me to ask how I thought it went,” Doyle said. “I told her I thought she was really strong, really forceful, and appeared really committed to her husband and to her family.” Clinton thanked her. “She was definitely pleased,” Doyle added. “She was happy with it because she was truthful. She said what she had to say. I love this guy. I respect this guy. Very matter of fact.” And in many corners of the press, she was praised. The Economist called her “sharp-tongued” and “attractive.” “Tough woman, this Hillary Clinton,” wrote a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. The TV critic at the Washington Post said Bill Clinton “looked like a scared kid. Not a presidential image. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, appeared impressively impervious, suggesting perhaps that the wrong Clinton is running for office.” She was lauded even by a leading New Hampshire Republican. Said Tom Rath, then a George H.W. Bush appointee as a director of the Legal Services Corporation and now a POLITICO Insider, to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the day after 60 Minutes: “The big winner was Hillary Clinton. I think he’s got a problem still.” But she also drew some fire from outside the pundit class. “Tammy’s madder than hell,” Wynette’s fifth husband told USA Today. Wynette wrote a plainspoken open letter in which she actually cut right to the crux, demanding an apology and portraying the aspiring West Wing spouse as an elitist enabler riding her husband’s coattails. “I believe you have offended every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House,” the singer said. She challenged Clinton to “stand toe to toe with me. I can assure you, in spite of your education, you will find me to be just as bright.” Told of Wynette’s reaction during a meeting with the editorial board of a small newspaper in Grand Junction, Colorado, Clinton rolled her eyes and slapped her forehead, according to an account from the Associated Press. “I didn’t mean to hurt Tammy Wynette as a person,” she said. “I happen to be a country-western fan.” But Clinton couldn’t find the right tone and stick with it. She seemed to vacillate between apologetic and apoplectic. She said sorry to Wynette, again, two nights later on national TV on ABC’s Primetime Live—in a lengthy feature in which she also offered up a withering dismissal of Flowers, calling her a money-grubber, a fame-chaser, “some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t have much of a resume to fall back on.” And the world offered its critique. Even Richard Nixon weighed in. “If the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent, it makes the husband look like a wimp,” the former president told the New York Times a week and a half after the 60 Minutes interview. Nixon cited Barbara Bush as the model wife—somebody who has her own opinions but doesn’t upstage her husband. By March, a new narrative had emerged. Said the Washington Post: “Hillary Clinton, Trying to Have it All; Lawyer, Author, Activist, Strategist, Mother, Political Wife … and Now, Political Problem?” Further complicating matters for her: the first story in the Times about the money-losing real estate deal in Northwest Arkansas that ultimately would metastasize into the Whitewater scandal and an article in the Post headlined, “The Uncertain Intersection: Politics and Private Interests; Hillary Clinton’s Law Firm is Influential With State.” Jerry Brown, the governor of California and an opponent in the presidential primaries, brought up the Post article in a debate, accusing Bill Clinton of funneling money to his wife’s firm—a false representation. He responded to Brown’s charge of “corruption” by calling him a liar and saying he “ought to be ashamed” for “jumping on my wife.” The next day, the day before the Illinois and Michigan primaries, with stress mounting, reporters approached Hillary Clinton at the Busy Bee. “Back then,” said Jim Cullinan, a staff aide doing her advance work, who was there, “it was much more casual in terms of the press being close to her.” Out came the comment about “cookies” and “teas.” “Exasperation,” said Piercy, her friend. “Complete exasperation.” “Just pure frustration,” said Jody Franklin, her chief of staff on that campaign. “I think this country wasn’t ready for a professional, strong, highly competent, feminist first lady—I think the country was not ready for that, and the campaign didn’t understand that,” Franklin said. “And there she was, getting humiliated on 60 Minutes, saving him—and then she gets shit for it. And then she gets shit for … working, for simply having a job.” *** The Clinton brain trust knew immediately “cookies” and “teas” would be a big problem. “As soon as I heard that,” Paul Begala, a chief strategist for the campaign, would say in 2000, “I thought, ‘People are going to take that out of context. They’re going to suggest she doesn’t care about stay-at-home moms.’ So I went up to her and I told her that. I pulled her aside, and I said, ‘You know, Hillary, you’ve got to go restate this. People are going to think that’s an attack on stay-at-home moms.’ And she had the most wounded and naïve look on her face. … She had no idea that might be taken out of context. She said, ‘No one could think that.’ She said, ‘I would have given anything to be a stay-at-home mom. My mother was a stay-at-home mom. I just didn’t have a choice because Bill was making $35,000 a year and we needed to support the family.’ I said, ‘I know that.’ And she said, ‘Oh, you worry too much.’ I mean, it was unimaginable to her that that would be a firestorm. I was certain it would be.” So outside, on the sidewalk in the cold, she tried to clean it up. “The work that I’ve done as a professional,” she explained, “as a public advocate, has been aimed in part to assure that women can make the choices that they should make—whether it’s full-time career, full-time motherhood, some combination, depending upon what stage of life they are at.” It didn’t help. And there she was, getting humiliated on 60 Minutes, saving him—and then she gets shit for it.” The next day, her husband won the primaries in Michigan and Illinois, closing in on the Democratic nomination—but headlines were about her. “Hillary Clinton Law Career Brings Up Spouse Role Issue,” said the Los Angeles Times. “Hillary Clinton is fair political game,” said the Chicago Tribune. “Hillary Clinton defends herself,” said the Boston Globe. And on NBC, making a connection that would calcify from there, correspondent Lisa Myers tied “cookies” and “teas” to 60 Minutes. “Hillary Clinton’s strong performance during the Gennifer Flowers episode helped save her husband’s candidacy,” Myers reported. “But now, she may be fast becoming an issue herself.” Times columnist William Safire gave it a name: “The Hillary Problem.” Gloria Cabe, the campaign’s congressional liaison and the manager of its office in Washington, worried that it had the potential to be “fatal.” “We got lots of phone calls,” Cabe later said. “And it was apparent to me that not only were we hearing from traditional women who had chosen, for whatever reason, to stay at home with their children, but we were inundated with calls from professional women who felt it had insulted them, who had made the decision to take a few years off—and many of them talked about baking cookies.” The campaign devised a course shift—the sort of Hillary-specific strategy her advisers say hadn’t totally existed up until that point—and it happened quickly. “Hillary Clinton,” Newsweek noticed in late March, two weeks post-Busy Bee, “has clearly lowered her profile on the campaign trail.” Bill Clinton pulled back his “buy one, get one free” stump-speech catchphrase, which had prompted talk of a kind of “co-presidency,” and Hillary Clinton started talking less about policy and more about family. She agreed to participate in a cookie bake-off sponsored by Family Circle magazine. She agreed to an interview for a puffy People profile about their friends, family and faith. She got her hair styled. She took off her unfussy professional woman headband. In May, she gave the graduation speech at her alma mater, 23 years after she spoke at commencement as a student. “As women today, you face tough choices,” she told the Wellesley College Class of 1992. “You know the rules are basically as follows,” she said. “If you don’t get married, you’re abnormal. If you get married but don’t have children, you’re a selfish yuppie. If you get married and have children, but work outside the home, you’re a bad mother. If you get married and have children, but stay home, you’ve wasted your education. “So you see,” she concluded, “if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed.” So you see,” Hillary concluded, “if you listen to all the people who make these rules, you might just conclude that the safest course of action is just to take your diploma and crawl under your bed.” She didn’t do that. But she did agree to adjustments—the latest in a sequence that had started with her acquiescences in Arkansas. “My recollection is that after the convention,” said Franklin, her chief of staff, “there was a very significant, purposeful shift in strategy.” It included appearances like a stop at a vocational school, Doyle remembered, to stage a photo-op of her getting her nails done by the cosmetology students. “She was like, ‘Really? This is what I’m doing now?’” “After those situations”—Tammy Wynette, “cookies” and “teas”—“the campaign … decided to use her to rally the base, a broad Democratic base who adored her. But that was like putting her in a box,” Franklin said. “She was put in a box for the rest of the campaign—and it worked.” “The political image makers are hard at it this year,” Tom Brokaw said on NBC News in early August, a few weeks after the convention. “They worried that Hillary Clinton was coming off as too bright, too outspoken, too upfront. So, they asked her to warm it up a bit.” It wasn’t lost on everybody—including some in the press—that her principal transgression actually seemed to be that she was a woman who said what she thought instead of quietly receding into the conventionally accepted political staging. “Women who are not clearly submissive are seen as dominating and reviled for it. Women who do fit the images [of submissiveness] are not taken seriously. Like Hillary Clinton, you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t.” “Politicians in both parties like to say that this is the Year of the Woman,” correspondent Andrea Mitchell pointed out in her Brokaw-introduced report. “But that doesn’t necessarily apply to the politician’s wife.” She compared the Hillary Clinton of the primaries with the Hillary Clinton of the general election. “When the wives are introduced these days,” Mitchell said, referring to Hillary Clinton and running mate Al Gore’s wife, Tipper, “it’s to take a bow and step back.” Throughout the summer and fall, a shorthand tag developed among newspapers, news magazines and the TV networks. “The Hillary Factor,” they started calling it. “Is She Helping or Hurting Her Husband,” Time asked on its cover in September. “But the real Hillary Factor,” argued Deborah Tannen, then a fellow at Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences, in an op-ed in October in the Times, “is the double bind that affects all successful or accomplished women—indeed, all women who do not fit stereotypical images of femininity: women who are not clearly submissive are seen as dominating and reviled for it. Women who do fit the images are not taken seriously. Like Hillary Clinton, you are damned if you do and damned if you don’t.” *** That November, obviously, Bill Clinton won—but his wife discovered that the tightrope she had walked in the 60 Minutes interview just kept going. She walked it as she took her place as a policy advisor with an office in the West Wing instead of the customary first lady quarters on the other side of the White House. She walked it as she led health care reform—and then stumbled, necessitating another recalibration, another “softening.” She walked it in 1998 through the Monica Lewinsky scandal, returning to national TV to mount another defense of her husband that he ultimately didn’t deserve—this time on The Today Show on NBC, this time alone, this time talking not about Tammy Wynette but a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” sparking echoes of 60 Minutes and bolstering the skepticism about their marriage, that it was mostly a union of political expedience. She walked the tightrope out of the White House, too, her eye on a political prize of her own—which she won. In the Senate, she walked it still, the world-famous former first lady who tried at the start to be head-down, back-bench anonymous, the aisle-crossing policy wonk who attempted to show a stern side with her vote to support the invasion of Iraq. And she walked it in 2007 and 2008, through her first presidential bid, beating Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary only after she cracked just a tad at a campaign stop at another eatery—16 years after the Busy Bee—and almost cried. “Re-Re-Re-Reintroducing Hillary Clinton,” the New York Times Magazine headlined a story last summer at the outset of her current campaign. The “issue of her political authenticity,” University of Maryland communications professor Shawn J. Parry-Giles wrote in her 2014 book Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics, has been a “preouccupation” of the press that has “dogged” Clinton “from 1992 onward.” All these questions—Why is she so stiff? Why is she so scripted? Why is she so cautious? Why is she so secretive?—I think it all goes back to 1992.” “I don’t know that Mrs. Clinton has ever fully recovered from the difficulties of the early stages of that campaign,” said Russell Riley, a professor and co-chair of the University of Virginia’s presidential oral history program. “All these questions—Why is she so stiff? Why is she so scripted? Why is she so cautious? Why is she so secretive?—I think it all goes back to 1992,” said Tannen, now a professor of linguistics at Georgetown. That interview plus “cookies” and “teas,” said Wanderer, her friend from Wellesley, added up to “an odd introduction, because I think both of those moments represented her trying to explain who she really is. But instead of saying what she actually is—a person dedicated to making positive changes to move the country forward in what you might call a progressive way—I think she felt very defensive about it, like this wasn’t going to be acceptable.” I’m not sitting here, some little woman … I suppose I could have … “Is she guarded all the time?” Franklin, her chief of staff in that ’92 campaign, said this week. “I think she is. And I understand why.” In both the 60 Minutes interview and the comment at the Busy Bee, Franklin said, “she was herself, she said what she believed, and with personality. But it was misinterpreted. And she got screwed for it.” To Doyle, one of Clinton’s closest advisers throughout that campaign, it all started with the 60 Minutes interview—about which, she said, there are two great truths. The first? “He would not have been president had she not defended him, period, end of story.” And the second? “There was no way for her to win in that situation, no way for her to win there, as a woman.”",1,0,0
537,"Washington (CNN)The Arizona Republic, the state's largest newspaper, has never endorsed a Democrat for president -- until now. In an op-ed published to its website Tuesday, the editorial board backed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump for president. ""The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,"" the editorial board wrote. In the op-ed, the newspaper's editorial board breaks down why they believe that Clinton is more qualified than Trump -- specifically that the Democratic nominee has better temperament and experience, has a record of public service, and has withstood ""decades of scrutiny."" The Arizona Republic joins other major papers with conservative editorial boards in endorsing Clinton or declining to endorse Trump. The Cincinnati Enquirer and Dallas Morning News are two other notable examples, with the Enquirer endorsing a Democrat for the first time in 100 years. The New Hampshire Union Leader, for the first time in 100 years, did not back Republican nominee Trump, opting instead to endorse Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson. The Arizona Republic endorsement said that Clinton, unlike Trump, for all of her mistakes and flaws, and has more experience with foreign policy than Trump does. And specifically for Arizona -- a state with a significant Latino population -- the newspaper said Trump wouldn't be able to ""broker solutions"" like Clinton. The paper cites a recent poll that shows Arizonians oppose both a border wall and deportations as solutions for illegal immigration. The newspaper editorial board also cited what it called Trump's frequent disrespect toward other people as reasons to oppose him. Including his mocking of a reporter's physical disability, his public feud with a Gold Star family, and his proposal to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the United States. The newspaper said that Trump is a candidate who can't control his words, unlike Clinton. And it writes that Clinton ""can reach out to those who feel left behind. She can make it clear that America sees them and will address their concerns."" ",1,0,0

Etonde Maloke, a friend of the victim, shared in a Facebook post on Tuesday a picture of three white students laughing together in a dorm room. The photo features the caption, “Locked the black bitch out.” The white students had actually posted the offensive photo on the black student’s Snapchat account. “My friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below,” Maloke explained. “They captioned it ‘locked the black bitch out’. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didn’t even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.” “We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not),” she wrote. “When said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.” I’m so livid!!

1581,"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding the shooting death of Keith Scott at the hands of Charlotte police. The police department says the shooting was justified, as Scott had a gun and threatened officers. Scott’s defenders say that he was merely waiting to pick up his children from their bus stop and was holding a book, not a gun. What is the truth? It’s still unclear, but a new revelation from Scott’s wife may shed some more light on what really happened.   The media has begun to dig into Scott’s background and found that Rakeyia Scott took out a restraining order against him, claiming that he was abusive. She also said that he had a gun and threatened to kill her. In it, she wrote, “He hit my 8 year-old in the head a total of three times with is [sic] fist… .He kicked me and threaten [sic] to kill us last night with his gun. He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that.”   The form also asked if there was any reason law enforcement officers should view him as a potential threat and if he carries a weapon. She answered “yes” and wrote, “He carries a 9mm black.” The order was filed October 9th, 2015 and less than two weeks later, Scott voluntarily cancelled it herself. But it certainly lends credence to the department’s claim that Scott was armed and dangerous. Police also released the dashcam and bodycam footage from the shooting, as well as photos of the handgun Scott had on him at the time. The gun was allegedly the same weapon that another homeowner reported as stolen after someone broke into their house.   And police dispute the notion that Scott was merely waiting for his children’s bus to arrive, peacefully reading a book and doing nothing wrong. They first observed him rolling a blunt, which was not a priority for them at first. But when they saw him hold up a gun, they took more notice and decided to arrest him, because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public safety. The officers, who were originally in plain clothes, outfitted themselves with marked duty vests and equipment so it would be clear they were police officers, and gave Scott multiple commands to drop the gun. He refused. Scott’s DNA and fingerprints were found on the gun, which was loaded. So again, we have another case of the Black Lives Matter movement exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to spawn riots and violence in the name of “justice.” ",0,0,1
841,"When you WATCH this VIDEO you MUST have tissues out. The further into the video I went, the more I cried. It starts out with a guy saying, “This goes out to the people who support Black Lives Matter. Until I see y’all protesting black on black crime that goes on in our neighborhood every f***ing day, shut the f**ck up goin’ around saying that Black Lives Matter. Shut the f**ck up with that sh*t!” You might wonder what he’s talking about so here are some statistics from the Uniform Crime Report’s Supplemental Homicide Reports published annually by the federal government that support his concern on black on black crime. These numbers explain why this guy is saying that black people are killing black people… because they are and en masse: ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* In 2012, white males were 38 percent of the population and committed 4,582 murders. That same year, black males were just 6.6 percent of the population but committed a staggering 5,531 murders. In other words: black people–at just a fifth of the size–committed almost 1,000 more murders than their white counterparts. The figures above highlight a horrific truth that black racialists and white liberals routinely ignore: Lawbreaking black Americans, young black males particularly, put themselves in close proximity to (mostly white male) police officers at rates sometimes five to 10 times higher than whites. This is a recipe for disaster. Thusly…. Blacka are only 13% of the population but have committed half of homicides in the United States for nearly 30 years. DOJ statistics show that between 1980 and 2008, black people committed 52% of homicides. In 2013, black criminals committed 38% of the murders. Whites accounted for just 31 percent. There are five times fewer black people than white people in America and, yet, they consistently carry out a larger share of the crimes? Given this rate, it’s no wonder that there aren’t more assistances where cops kill black criminals. The video then leads to the speech of a police captain who is reporting on the drive-by shooting of a little girl and how he now has to send his officers out there looking for suspects with a gun under their seat. The video then goes into an emotional string of video where you see police officers hesitating to a criminal with a gun pointed at them, the officer always gets shot when hesitating. It helps anyone understand WHY police officers MUST shoot when being threatened, if they don’t they will be killed. Here are statistics that really show you who is getting killed more often; white criminals are. Of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012: ⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males ⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males ⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races ⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females ⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females ⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races If there is anyone who should be afraid right now it should be: 1. White male criminals because you’re more likely to get shot by police. 2. Black person who lives around black people because you are more likely to become a victim of homicide around more black people. 3. People who are in the Black Lives Matter movement because you are increasing your risk of injury just by being in an environment where the cops are your enemy… who will protect you? Plus you are literally standing among the people who commit the HIGHEST disproportionate amount of violent crimes in the nation. 4. All of us because the BLM are going to destroy the greatest police force in the world that protects our Bill of Rights better than anyone right now. We are about to get a Federalized police force and the Constitution is DEAD without the local Sheriff. 5. Police Officers because they’re in more danger today than ever before because of the farce of Black Lives Matter movement giving people permission to shoot white Police Officers just because. NOW, watch this VIDEO to truly understand what Police Officers go through and how their hesitation may cost their life and the lives of others.  ",0,0,1
785,"Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president. This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER. From Bearing Arms: We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy. Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare. Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation. Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.  ",0,0,1
850,"Scores of athletes have been protesting the National Anthem, refusing to stand and kneeling instead. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kicked off the trend, claiming that he could not show respect to this country when he is so horribly “oppressed”. Many other athletes followed, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement… and none of them faced any repercussions for their actions. But what happens if someone takes the opposite view, and openly opposes Black Lives Matter? Well, apparently, they get punished. Seattle Mariners catcher Steve Clevenger does not agree with the Black Lives Matter movement, and after the riots in Charlotte, he decided to make that known. He fired off a series of tweets that got a lot of attention. “BLM is pathetic once again! Obama you are pathetic once again! Everyone involved should be locked behind bars like animals!” he wrote. He followed that up with another tweet, writing, “Black people beating whites when a thug got shot holding a gun by a black officer haha shit cracks me up! Keep kneeling for the Anthem!”   Those tweets were deleted, but not before Clevenger set off a firestorm of criticism. And the Mariners were not pleased: they announced he would be suspended without pay for the rest of the season.   Clevenger has been sitting the bench since June due to an injury, but he still had a salary of $516,500 for the season. There are 10 days left in the season, which results in him losing just under $34,000. After being suspended, Clevenger released a statement apologizing for his tweets:   The question is, why is it unacceptable for Clevenger to express his opinion about Black Lives Matter, yet it’s acceptable for other athletes to protest in favor of them?

1260,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are deadlocked in three swing states, according to a new set of polls, underscoring the stakes of Monday night’s debate for the final stretch of the election. The former secretary of state holds narrow leads in Florida, Iowa and North Carolina, all within the polls’ margins of error, with Clinton only well ahead of Trump in Virginia in this set of the surveys. A Florida Chamber of Commerce poll puts the Democratic nominee just two points ahead of her GOP rival, 43 percent to 41 percent, with the state’s likely voters. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, polled at 8 percent, while the Green Party’s Jill Stein did not register any support. In a head-to-head race that excludes Johnson, Clinton's lead grows by a point, 45 percent to 42 percent. In North Carolina, Clinton’s advantage over Trump among likely voters is just a single point, according to a High Point University poll. The former secretary of state leads Trump 43 percent to 42 percent, with Johnson polling at 10 percent. Stein is not on the ballot in North Carolina. The two-way presidential race is closest in Iowa, where a Loras College poll puts Clinton’s lead over Trump at just three-tenths of a point, 42.3 percent to 42 percent. The Manhattan billionaire edges slightly ahead in a four-way race, leading 38.3 percent to 37.7 percent over the Democratic nominee. Johnson earned the support of 9 percent of respondents while Stein polled at 1.2 percent. The best news for Clinton came from Virginia, where a Christopher Newport University poll put her ahead by 10 points, 48 percent to 38 percent, among that state’s likely voters. The state was also the strongest for Johnson, who polled at 15 percent in a five-way race that also included Stein (3 percent) and independent candidate Evan McMullin (3 percent). Clinton’s advantage over Trump in that five-way race dropped to six points, 39 percent to 33 percent. In POLITICO’s Battleground States Polling Average, which includes 11 swing states, Clinton still edges Trump 43.7 percent to Trump’s 40.9 percent. The Florida Chamber of Commerce poll was conducted from Sept. 15-20, reaching 617 likely voters in that state with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4 percent. The High Point University poll reached 404 North Carolinian likely voters from Sept. 17-22, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.9 points. Loras College’s poll of Iowan likely voters was conducted from Sept. 20-22, reaching 491 respondents with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.4 percent. The Christopher Newport University poll was in the field from Sept. 15-23, reaching 1,003 likely voters in Virginia. Its margin of error is plus-or-minus 3.9 percent.",1,0,0
912,"Bloomberg News will become the first ever 24 hour cable news television network to live broadcast a presidential debate with live, in-screen fact checking tonight. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released a 19 page fact-check in advance of tonight’s debate listing the many lies and false bromides spread by her opponent. Considering that Republican nominee Donald Trump  averages one lie per 3.5 minutes of public statements, their graphics and fact check teams will be working overtime, according to Politico: Bloomberg TV will conduct on-screen fact checks of statements made by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during Monday night’s debate, POLITICO has confirmed. The channel’s decision to conduct an on-screen fact-check sets Bloomberg apart from the other major TV networks, none of whom have committed to doing on-screen fact checks during the debate. Most will leave the fact-checking to segments in the post-debate analysis coverage. NPR is also planning an aggressive fact checking strategy in their online news offerings, and all of the networks plan to check facts after the candidates leave the stage, but in this extraordinary election there’s no better time than when 100 million Americans and people around the world watching live. Bloomberg News is setting an exemplary standard which  NBC News has refused to emulate. NBC host Lester Holt, a registered Republican, will moderate tonight’s event. Hopefully, all of the major broadcast news networks will make the effort to upgrade their fact checking teams in time for the last two debates, one of which moderated by Fox News’ Chris Wallace has already been announced as a fact-free debate. Facts don’t matter much to Republican voters or Trump supporters, but to the moderates and independents who don’t know what policies are at stake in this year’s election, they’re very important, and should be what they base their voting decisions upon. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will only share a stage tonight and for two other nights – if all goes as planned with the next two debates – so there’s limited time to disseminate what’s factual versus what isn’t to American voters immediately while attention is on the truth. Unless we want this election to truly usher in a “post-truth” era where information is accepted regardless of its relation to reality, we must hold Donald Trump to the truth. We cannot allow him to lie to the American people any longer. Tonight’s debate begins at 9pm. You can click here to watch online. ",0,1,0
451,"Washington (CNN)The FBI released Friday nearly 200 pages of notes from its investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, just three days before she squares off against Donald Trump in the first presidential debate. The notes, taken from interviews of top Clinton aides, supporters and others, include details of how a close Clinton confidant explained how the State Department made sure the White House system would not bounce back the emails from the then-secretary of state. But the documents -- a summary of which had already been released in the overall FBI report -- provide little in the way of major bombshells. Politically, however, Friday's release helps keep the issue relevant before the debate. The release also comes hours after news that top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had obtained a limited immunity deal from the FBI in order to cooperate with its investigation. In one exchange, an unidentified interviewee details alleged efforts by a top State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, to argue during the release of the Clinton emails for classifications that would protect her. But Kennedy, in his own interview, denied the charge. Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, in her interview, explained how they had to update email addresses with the White House so Clinton could email President Barack Obama because the President could only receive emails from approved addresses. If her email was not on an approved list, which was managed by the President's staff, the White House server would reject it. When Abedin was shown a 2012 email exchange, she did not recognize the pseudonym -- when agents explained it was Obama, she replied, ""How is this not classified?"" There is no evidence Obama knew that Clinton was using a private email server at the time. He has said he only found out about her use of it when it became public. Many of those who communicated with Clinton have told the FBI they didn't realize she was using a private server, and often one may not realize what email address is behind a name unless one clicks on it. Agents also interviewed ""Guccifer"" -- the hacker who targeted the Bush family -- who detailed his successful infiltration of close Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal's email account and reviewed 30,000 emails and downloaded 25 attachments. Guccifer also detailed taking a screenshot of one Blumenthal exchange regarding the Benghazi attacks. FBI releases Hillary Clinton email report In other interviews released Friday evening, Clinton aides seemed generally unconcerned about her use of a private email server and said she adhered to standard security measures -- arguments they have made extensively in public. But one IT worker took a somewhat cavalier attitude, joking in one interview that a new 60-day retention policy was a ""Hillary coverup operation"" -- which sparked the Trump campaign's anger. ""The fact an IT staffer maintaining Clinton's secret server called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a 'Hillary coverup operation' suggests there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. ""It's no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal, including Clinton's top State Department aide and attorney Cheryl Mills, secured immunity deals from the Obama Justice Department to avoid prosecution."" The latest revelations in the Clinton email scandal are certain to play a central role in Trump's line of attack Monday, when the two meet for their first presidential debate in New York. Trump has built his ""Crooked Hillary"" line of insults off arguments stemming from her emails. The additional notes were released three weeks after the FBI released its report from its investigation of Clinton and her emails, as well as the notes from Clinton's own high-profile interview with federal agents. Clinton, in her interview, said she did not know about key records retention policies and whether she was violating rules. But on the trail, her campaign and supporters have routinely said she did not break any laws with her email handling. No criminal charges FBI Director James Comey in July took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the FBI's conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the Justice Department. The DOJ followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited. After Comey testified about the decision before Congress, members requested access to his agency's report. Last month, the bureau gave members of Congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other Clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified. Comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. Clinton was not under oath.

61,"In the chaos and fog of a brutal conflict that has claimed an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 lives, a ragtag group of former bakers, tailors, salespeople, teachers, pharmacists, painters, carpenters and students has emerged as real-life heroes, providing a glimmer of hope in Syria's brutal five-year-old civil war. The Syria Civil Defense group, otherwise known as the White Helmets, get their inspiration from an oft-quoted verse of the Quran: ""to save a life is to save all of humanity."" So far, the group of about 3,000 White Helmets have performed that feat some 60,000 times, often working in perilous conditions surrounded by violent conflict. On Thursday, the group won the Right Livelihood Award, often described as the ""Alternative Nobel."" The group has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace prize, with the support of over 133 organizations worldwide so far.   Their job may be the most dangerous in the world. Comprised of unpaid volunteers using whatever supplies they can get their hands on, the White Helmets often place their own lives at risk, venturing into active battle zones to assist the sick and wounded. ""We go to save as many people as we can,"" says White Helmet Khaled Farah. If one person was alive, that's enough for us to take the risk."" So far, some 132 White Helmet volunteers have been killed in the line of duty, the majority from so-called ""double-tap"" strikes, where warplanes will drop a second bomb in the same spot of an initial strike as people rush in to aid the wounded and remove the dead. ""I help civilians every day, knowing that this will give my daughter and my country a better future,"" says another White Helmet, known simply as Fatima. Their motto is ""Humanity, Solidarity, Impartiality,” and the group says it services some seven million people in vulnerable areas of the country, some of which have been racked by unremitting violence. When not conducting rescue missions, the volunteers teach children and adults on safety measures to take during aerial attacks, help provide first aid and medical services, assist in the the evacuation of civilian populations from active conflict zones and help re-establish critical infrastructure like water and electricity. On Friday, The Associated Press reported that at least two civil defense centers were targeted in a renewed bombing campaign just days after a ceasefire backed by the U.S. and Russia unraveled. More than 13 million people require humanitarian assistance of some kind across Syria. Some 6 million people have been forced from their homes in the country — nearly 1 million of them in the past six months alone. Of particular concern are the nearly 600,000 Syrians the United Nations estimates are living in besieged areas, cut off from regular access to basic necessities and living with the daily threat of deadly violence.",1,0,0
1526,"I honestly don’t know what happened to the NFL. It was once an organization that promoted the best of sportsmanship. People like Vince Lombardi, George Halas and Tom Landry all exuded a quiet dignity that permeated the sport.   Today, we’re left with endless showboats, back-talk from multi-millionaire primadonnas and now displays of outright contempt for their country. For some reason, the NFL as an organization has allowed these spoiled children to do whatever they want and the sport has greatly suffered as a result. Still, those that remember the good ol’ days of gridiron grit aren’t having it. Legendary coach Mike Ditka recently weighed in on the controversy surrounding several ingrates who refuse to stand for the national Anthem. Directing his comments to Colin Kaepernick, the beginner of this nauseating trend, Ditka had some strong words. When asked in a recent interview what he thought about Kaepernick, Ditka let loose: “I think it’s a problem, anybody who disrespects this country and the flag. If they don’t like the country, they don’t like our flag, get the hell out. That’s what I think. “So if you’re asking me, I have no respect for Colin Kaepernick. He probably has no respect for me, that’s his choice. My choice is that I like this country, I respect our flag. And I don’t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on. “I see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity. Now, if they don’t want to look for them, then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work. Now, if you don’t work, that’s a different problem.” Ditka has also blasted President Obama as the “worst president we’ve ever had” and voiced disapproval for the 2014 incident in which some Rams players put up a “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture in solidarity with Michael Brown, a thug who was killed after attacking a police officer. This country as a whole needs to get a lot tougher and needs to reject this breed of radicalism that is tearing our country apart.

Anderson Cooper: But, it does imply that she has antipathy, that she has hatred toward, I guess in this case youâre talking about African-Americans, but I donât want to put words in your mouth.

970,"Hillary Clinton on Monday leveled some of her most charged attacks against Donald Trump yet, accusing the nominee of enabling Islamic State fighters with his rhetoric and hinting he may be committing treason. With a spate of domestic attacks over the weekend refreshing terror fears, Clinton and Trump hurled insults at each other on Monday, trying to convince voters that the other candidate would be a disastrous commander in chief. Story Continued Below Clinton held an impromptu news conference in the morning in which she presented herself as a steady hand in the face of terror threats and Trump as a reckless leader who is already making the United States less safe. “We’ve heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists,” Clinton said. “We know from the former head of the Counterterrorism Center, Mike Olsen, that the language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,” she added, using the constitutional definition of treason. Trump’s camp fired back, blaming Clinton for the rise of the Islamic State because she supported pulling back on troops in Iraq in 2011. “Hillary Clinton’s comments today accusing Mr. Trump of treason are not only beyond the pale, it’s also an attempt to distract from her horrible record on ISIS,” Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller said. Trump himself piled on, trying to shame Clinton and tying her to President Barack Obama on the terrorism issue. “Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” Trump said in a statement. “The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking ISIS seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” And during an afternoon rally in Florida, Trump accused Clinton of being tougher on his supporters than she has been on terrorists. “Hillary talks tougher about my supporters than she does Islamic terrorists, right?” he said, to cheers. “She called patriotic Americans who support our campaign, many of them cops and soldiers, deplorable and irredeemable, and she means it. Millions and millions of people,” Trump added, recalling remarks Clinton made earlier this month when she lumped half of his supporters into a “basket of deplorables.” The heated language on both sides comes as each are trying to reassure rattled Americans that they are the most capable of stepping into the commander in chief role. The series of planted bombs around New York and New Jersey over the weekend as well as the mass stabbing at a Minnesota mall has freshly raised fears of the reach of the Islamic State, even though details are still emerging about the inspiration for the attacks. While Clinton tried to present herself as the clearheaded alternative to Trump’s reckless bombast, she also had to thread the needle when it comes to her own legacy as secretary of state and Obama’s track record. “This is a serious challenge,” Clinton told reporters, as she sought to reassure voters that the U.S. is on the right track in combating that challenge. “We are well-equipped to meet it. And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.” She warned against getting “diverted and distracted” by Trump's inflammatory words, and dismissed Trump’s attacks on her past efforts to combat terrorism while at the State Department. “Well, it’s like so much else he says: It’s not grounded in fact. It’s meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,” Clinton said. “I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work as I’ve done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS.” Clinton also suggested Americans won’t hear her opponent’s plan, and not because it's secret. “He keeps saying he has a secret plan. Well, the secret is he has no plan,” she said. “So let’s focus on what we really can do, and what I've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.” But Trump was eager to tether Clinton to Obama, and also pounced on a remark from White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who referred to the terrorism fight as a “narrative battle” against whether the U.S. and the West is battling against the Muslim religion. “I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives.’ These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life,” Trump said. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, joined in the sniping, saying he was dumbfounded by the White House’s use of the term “narrative fight” and linking Clinton to it. “I’m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know that we’re at war,” Pence told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. “The White House spokesman today actually said that we were in a — quote — narrative fight, in a narrative battle. I don’t even know what that is.” Obama, meanwhile, pats himself on the back as he credited the U.S. for exposing the Islamic State “as the failed cause that it is” by taking more of its territory.",1,0,0

1394,"The JonBenet Ramsey case has plagued America for 20 years, now. Who would want to murder such a beautiful young girl? What would their motive be? How could they have pulled it off in a way that would stump law enforcement for two decades? In the last month, stories about the case, including a CBS special, A&E documentary and a Dr. Phil interview with the girl’s brother, have come to the forefront. Have we finally evolved enough technologically speaking that we can now determine who murdered little JonBenet Ramsey?  The biggest break in this case was the audio picked up by the 911 dispatcher after JonBenet’s mother, Patsy Ramsey, tried to hang up the phone. At the time this occurred, technology was just not good enough to determine who was speaking or what they said. Now, however, the audio could be slowed down and we can finally hear this potentially critical piece of audio. Keep in mind as you read this that JonBenet’s father John Ramsey was and perhaps still is considered a suspect in his daughter’s murder. From PerezHilton: What Clemente (pictured above) and the rest of his team discovered was a voice that sounded like the beauty pageant contestant’s father, John Ramsey, saying, “We’re not speaking to you,” followed by Patsy saying, “What did you do? and “Help me, Jesus.” On top of that, it also sounds like, what specialists believe to be a small child, possibly nine-year-old Burke Ramsey, saying, “What did you find?” After this point, a female voice can be heard saying, “We’ve called the police, now what?” Additionally, the ransom note was determined to have taken approximately 21 minutes to write according to investigators and is said to have contained several lines from the movies Dirty Harry and Speed. Another odd coincidence was the fact that the ransom demanded was about equal to the amount that John Ramsey was given as a bonus that year. Perhaps the most bizarre finding of all was the “maternal language” that linguistics experts say was noted in the letter. Not only this, but the misspellings that were included in the letter appeared to have been placed there on purpose, so suspicion would point to a person for whom English is not their native language. But as the experts concluded, English was the first language of whomever wrote the letter. Could all of this information be pointing not only to the father, but to the parents as a team? ",0,0,1

1614,"While the U.S. Department of Justice temporarily halted construction of a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline, two other pipelines are moving forward. In May, the Obama administration granted the permits for both the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines, and while construction has not yet begun on the pipelines, implementation plans for the building of the pipelines is well underway. Earlier this week, DeSmogBlog investigative reporter Steve Horn highlighted the approval and pending construction of both pipelines, as well as their significant impact on local water supplies and indigenous territory. As Horn wrote, the Trans-Pecos pipeline will carry natural gas extracted from the Permian Basin in West Texas, and transport it across international borders to Mexico. According to the Texas Tribune, the 42-inch-wide Trans-Pecos Pipeline will carry 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas every day under the Rio Grande River. Should a leak or spill occur, the effects could be felt in both Texas and Mexico. The Comanche Trail pipeline, which is also 42-inches, will carry gas from the Waha Hub in the Northern part of Pecos County, Texas, to San Elizario, Texas, where it will then be carried across the United States/Mexico border. “[The] Trans-Pecos and Comanche go through the Big Bend area, a rural area containing mountains, desert, and ranch land. Most importantly, they link to a massive set of pipelines in Mexico that are in the process of being built and it’s a bit difficult to say what the impacts of land/spills would be there,” Horn told US Uncut. “What sorts of environmental/ecological reviews are being done in Mexico? What are the potential risks of spills there and would we even hear about them if they took place?” However, Horn says the “elephant in the room” on assessing environmental impact is the fracking being done to take natural gas out of Texas’ Permian Basin. “With temperature records being broken left and right, that’s what the conversation should really center around,” Horn said. According to the latest status report filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) earlier this month by pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners (the company also building the Dakota Access Pipeline), construction has not yet begun. However, because the pipeline has already been granted approval by both the United States and Mexican governments, Horn says the only recourse left for activists is civil disobedience. “Dakota Access, and everything that preceded the now-ongoing civil disobedience and largest convening of Native American tribes in modern history, shows the regulatory system is designed as a corporate rubber-stamp process,” Horn said. “The courts are happy to ratify rulings based on laws written by and for Corporate America.” Horn credited the Native American tribes chaining their bodies to pipeline construction equipment in North Dakota with the Obama administration’s recent call to temporarily halt Dakota Access Pipeline construction near the Missouri River. “[Civil disobedience] might be the only option left given how much the deck is stacked in favor powerful big business interests in the US regulatory and legislative system.”          ",0,1,0

However, he didn’t say anything about the recent attacks then and as of noon (East Coast Time) Monday, President Barack Obama has made ZERO comments on the string of terrorist attacks hitting cities in the United States. Over the weekend there were a number of terror attacks in the name of ‘allah’ that has devastated some communities and killed or injured dozens of people.

178,"A member of Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign has creepy words about what could happen if her candidate becomes president of the United States. As part of a PBS special on the candidates, former contestant and current Trump 2016 director of African-American outreach Omarasa Manigault said the key to the campaign was Trumpâs desire to see his political enemies on their knees:  Omarosa Manigault, a contestant on âThe Apprenticeâ who is director of African-American outreach for Trumpâs campaign, explains what she sees as Trumpâs motivations for running for president. Among them: resentments. âEvery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,â she says. âItâs everyone whoâs ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him â it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.â In the video accompanying Manigaultâs comments, the night of the 2011 White House Correspondentâs Association dinner is revisited, in which President Obama infamously roasted Donald Trump, who was in attendance. The President, riffing on Trumpâs promotion of the birther conspiracy theory, came at the reality TV star with his comedy guns blazing. Obama heaped joke after joke on Trump during the roast, and reports have indicated that Trump was seething but sitting stone-faced during the monologue. Some now believe that the episode embarrassed Trump so completely that he decided then to run for president as revenge for the humiliation. Regardless of whether that is true or not, history will record that as Obama was crushing Trumpâs spirit, he had already given the green light to the Navyâs infamous Seal Team Six to go into Pakistan and capture or execute al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As the Correspondentâs Association audience laughed at Obama making fun of Trump, members of the U.S. Navy were in the process of killing one of the most wanted men in world history. And Obama never broke a sweat. ",0,1,0
289,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's campaign manager sought to downplay concerns raised by a report Tuesday that the Republican nominee's personal philanthropy used more than $250,000 to litigate lawsuits against opponents of his business interests. Kellyanne Conway said she's not worried about the Washington Post report that said on four occasions the Donald J. Trump Foundation cut checks to settle suits in a controversial and potentially illegal tactic, given that the foundation is funded primarily with other donors' money, not his own, according to the Post review of legal documents and interviews. ""Trump is using his charities to benefit his businesses, which is against the law,"" Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan of his report. The most substantial donation was $100,000 to Fisher House, a veterans' charity, as part of a settlement with the city of Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club. Conway defended the donation as a settlement because of a flag Trump wanted to raise at the Mar-a-Lago. ""I think this is a classic Donald Trump,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""He wanted to raise the American flag as high as he possibly could over Mar-a-Lago. I think a lot of Americans at this point would applaud that. And of course the county said he couldn't do that, it had to be smaller, so they started assessing a $1,250 fine. So the way they wanted to settle it was for Trump to donate $100,000 to a veteran's group."" And another check for $158,000 was distributed from the foundation as a way for a Trump golf course to settle another lawsuit, according to the Post. ""I've been talking to the people who are responsible for the Trump Foundation to get some facts and some figures,"" she said. ""It's very important for people to understand what happened in these cases. Donations went to veterans groups ... How did the Mar-a-Lago benefit from him giving $100,000 to veterans? The veterans benefited and I think that's great and I applaud him for doing that."" Burnett said: ""Well, the business benefited by the lawsuit going away and being settled, right? That would be how the business benefited."" ""Well, there are many lawsuits everyday against people ... I think you're making things up based on facts as they are not reported in this story, which also uses a lot of conditional phrasing, I'd like to point out,"" Conway said. Conway also added that Trump frequently is ""signing checks privately to help people"" from his own bank account separate from the foundation, ""You can only imagine how many people have asked Mr. Trump for his time and his resources and his connections and his money privately, and he does that and he doesn't have cameras in there, it doesn't go through foundations,"" she said. Burnett pointed that the public could verify those donations if Trump released his tax returns, to which Conway didn't directly respond. Trump's Foundation has come under scrutiny from investigators and Democrats over possible pay-for-play schemes. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation to make sure it is abiding by state charity law, and House Democrats have called for the Department of Justice to look at Trump's relationship with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who declined to formally investigate it.

560,"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: A total of 205 Clinton Foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $216 million since 2009, were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation’s capital: prestigious seats at one or more White House State Dinners, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation. At least 15 of the Clinton Foundation’s corporate donors — representing $47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners. Significantly, the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all, but were ensconced in the Department State’s Office of Protocol. The protocol office, chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists. Despite the Democratic presidential nominee’s departure from the Department of State in 2013, all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout Obama’s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill Clinton’s White House or in Hillary’s Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns. Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton’s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “walked away” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office. After Cheng left the Department of State, he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation. He is now Hillary’s national fundraiser, leading her presidential bid to raise $2 billion. As a result, The Daily Beast once called him, “Hillary Clinton’s $2 billion money man.” If Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation, he may have violated a special “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008. The MOU warned of avoiding “potential or actual conflict of interest.” Cheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208, a federal statute that “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests,” including those of a prospective employer or a family member. “How much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol, migrated over to the Clinton Foundation,” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation. “We don’t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis Cheng’s personal cell phone, or on a contact list that might have been emailed.” he said in an interview with TheDCNF. Neither the foundation nor Hillary’s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng. Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action, asserting, “to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation.” Yet, official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington, D.C., and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce. Guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors, but they also offer privileged access to the president, top White House staff and many cabinet members. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova, who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington, D.C., told TheDCNF the White House dinners weren’t only benefits, but amounted to the “selling of access.” “The obvious connection between donations and access to big, White House state dinners is very important,” he said in an interview with TheDCNF.  “It was clearly a reward to donors, something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation,” he stated. DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case. “We are looking into Cheng’s relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class,” former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF. Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust (FACT). “Cheng is the person in the middle of this situation. He had substantial input as to who was invited, who got seated where,” he said. “I would say Cheng’s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing,” Whitaker added. “It’s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation, not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department, but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House,” he told TheDCNF. FACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act. The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015, but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election. “They have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now they’re telling us that we probably won’t get it until mid-to-late November,” Whitaker said. He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009. The protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans. When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office, his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who, at age 32, served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president. After Cheng left in 2011, his replacement was Natalie Jones, who was Hillary’s Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid. Jones was joined by Mark Walsh, Hillary’s LGBT “outreach director” from her 2008 campaign. Peter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office. He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill Clinton’s White House. One of the most revealing illustration of Cheng’s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges. In a March 8, 2012 email from Marshall to Jones, Cheng and Hillary’s deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin, the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14, 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron. “Invited to state dinner,” Marshall informed the group. Two of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who gave between $100,000 to $250,000, and Fred Eychaner, who committed $25 million to the foundation. “Nice,” replies Abedin. Although the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and Clinton’s official business, Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign nationals. In a June 11, 2012 email, he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner. “Attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night’s Clinton Foundation dinner,” he wrote Abedin. Among those attending was Recep Ozkan, a Turkish national who donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. Ozkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen, a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan. Erdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen, according to Tuesday reports. Also attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma, who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office. The email was obtained by Citizens United, a conservative group, under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta, a long-time personal friend of Bill’s who was convicted of insider trading. He served two years in a federal penitentiary. Gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job. Without any experience, he paid her a six figure salary. Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009. Ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during Bill’s first term at the White House.  At the time, Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors. “To see the pattern, you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House, the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom, to sell seats on Air Force One,” Ortel told TheDCNF. “So this was an old game.” Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation, told TheDCNF, “This is further evidence of the Clinton’s ‘Pay to Play’ mentality. The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government’s highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check.” “The quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything,” Blackburn charged. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs’ chairman and CEO, attended one of the hottest state dinners — a January 19, 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao. His company donated $1 to $5 million to the foundation, and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website. But that wasn’t the only contributions to Bill and Hillary. The company also gave the couple $2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s CEO and chairman, attended the May 19, 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon, Mexico’s former president. The Bank of America Foundation donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation, and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $100,000 to $250,000. But Bank of America also paid more than $1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary. The Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were: Honeywell, GE, Dreamworks, PepsiCo, Morgan Stanley, Coca Cola, Dow, Boeing, Intel, UPS, Comcast, IBM and the Blackstone Group. Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners. J.T. Mastranadi, political director of the Citizens United, said his organization’s conclusion was, “regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance.” TheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and Hillary’s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation. Neither responded. To see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners, click here.

Members of the union wrote a letter to the San Francisco 49ers, which was obtained by KNTV, warning that if the team does not take action against Kaepernick, ""it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities."" The Santa Clara Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency at Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play. About 70 officers choose work during games and are paid as security personnel. The union says about two-thirds of the officers who work at Levi's Stadium are from Santa Clara. Officers from other departments could be hired if Santa Clara officers decide not to show up, but Saunders says this could create a conflict with the city's contract with the union.

386,"Washington (CNN)Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them. The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear ""betrays a naked political agenda."" House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify. ""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt."" RELATED: Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college map Pagliano was first called before the oversight committee last week but did not appear.

""A subpoena issued by a congressional committee is required by law to serve a valid legislative purpose -- and there is none here.

727,"A Daisy of a Rerun I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.  The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater. Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media. I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign. Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers. Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events. Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected. Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.” As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder. Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph? Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance. It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing.  Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation. Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion. These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections. With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.” Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame. Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine:  “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”  Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review. Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

249,"New York (CNN)President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists. During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear. ""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey."" ""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American."" The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens. RELATED: NY, NJ bombings: Suspect wounded, arrested after shootout; 2 officers hit The attack appeared linked to another explosion in Seaside Park, New Jersey, and a series of pipe bombs found in a backpack Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey. A third incident in Minnesota, where a man stabbed nine people before being shot, is being investigated separately as a ""potential act of terrorism,"" Obama said. Monday afternoon, Obama said he'd spoken with law enforcement officers who helped apprehend Ahmad Khan Rahami, a suspect in this weekend's bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, and hailed their actions as heroic. He also said he phoned an off-duty officer who neutralized the attacker in Minnesota. ""It's just one more reminder of the skill and sacrifice and what they put on the line every single day to make sure we're safe,"" Obama said following talks with Iraq's prime minister Haider al-Abadi. An ISIS wing claimed responsibility for the Minnesota attack, though Obama avoided pinning any specific motivation on the attacks during his appearances on Monday. He did, however, insist his administration was going after the terror group aggressively to prevent any further violence. ""We will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the internet, to carry out attacks,"" Obama said, using the administration's term for the Islamic State group. ""We are going to continue to go after them. We're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure."" Following his talks with Abadi, Obama conceded retaking Iraq's second largest city from the terror group would be difficult.

1033,"Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly is teaming up with ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" producer Michael De Luca for a new scripted comedy series that will focus on the life of the campaign embeds on the presidential trail. The series, called ""Embeds"", will feature six half-hour episodes following ""five young reporters in way over their heads as they find themselves shaping the future of the country through raucous adventures in an unexpected world of sex, drugs, and swing states on the presidential campaign trail,"" Variety reports. The project is an amalgamation of new and old media from across the spectrum: SnapChat's Peter Hamby (a former CNN reporter) and Vice News' Scott Conroy co-created and will write the script for Verizon-owned streaming platform Go90. According to Variety, Conroy, who was just hired by Vice as a producer for politics and policy on Vice's new nightly show, will leave Vice News for the project. ""Embeds"" is not Kelly's first foray into the scripted television world. She is also developing and producing the White House drama “The Residence” for FX alongside actor Kevin Spacey.",1,0,0
346,"Washington (CNN)ISIS is suspected of firing a shell with mustard agent that landed at the Qayyara air base in Iraq Tuesday where US and Iraqi troops are operating, according to several US officials. The shell was categorized by officials as either a rocket or artillery shell. After it landed on the base, just south of Mosul, US troops tested it and received an initial reading for a chemical agent they believe is mustard. No US troops were hurt or have displayed symptoms of exposure to mustard agent. US officials said Tuesday that additional testing had definitely concluded that a mustard agent was not used in the attack. Last week, another official had said the agent had ""low purity"" and was ""poorly weaponized."" A second official called it ""ineffective."" A US defense official said troops had gone out to look at the ordnance after it landed. Based on seeing what they thought was a suspect substance, two field tests were conducted. The first test was positive and the second was negative, the official said. The substance is now being sent to a lab for further examination. Decontamination precaution US troops involved in the incident went through decontamination showers as a precaution. No troops have shown any symptoms of exposure, such as skin blistering. CNN has reported on previous instances where ISIS has fired rounds with mustard agents in Iraq and Syria. ""I don't know of a case like this where it was proximate to US forces like this before,"" said one military official, noting that ""potentially"" the rocket round was ""within hundreds of yards"" of the US forces and ""within the security perimeter"" of the base. The US officials said they ""had expected"" that ISIS might try use chemical weapons as US and Iraqi forces push towards Mosul in an effort to take the city back from ISIS. Several hundred US troops are using the base as a staging area for supporting Iraqi forces. All of this has led the Pentagon to assess on a preliminary basis that it was ISIS that fired at the base, since the terror group has been making mustard agent for some time. In the course of its air campaign against ISIS, US airstrikes have hit several locations the US believes are production sites for mustard agent. US officials emphasized that mustard agent is relatively easy to produce, and they continue to hit suspected manufacturing sites when they find them. US troops are routinely outfitted with protective gear in the event of a chemical weapons attack. CNN's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",1,0,0
887,"It’s the nightmare scenario we hope doesn’t happen: On November 8, somewhere around midnight or shortly thereafter, the election returns are finally in from across the nation and it becomes clear that Donald J. Trump is the next President of the United States. But instead of reaching for your passport and booking an extended vacation to another country, consider what University of Utah law professor Christopher L. Peterson had to say in a paper he just published: Even if he were elected, there’s enough evidence already in the matter of Trump University to impeach the Orange Menace before he even raises his hand and takes the oath of office. Peterson writes: “In the United States, it is illegal for businesses to use false statements to convince consumers to purchase their services. The evidence indicates that Trump University used a systemic pattern of fraudulent representations to trick thousands of families into investing in a program that can be argued was a sham. “Fraud and racketeering are serious crimes that legally rise to the level of impeachable acts.”   In the paper, which is titled Trump University and Presidential Impeachment, Professor Peterson also notes: “Somehow in the cacophony of the 2016 presidential campaign, no legal academic has yet turned to the question of whether Trump’s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the impeachment clause of the United States Constitution.” So instead of taking up residence at the White House, Trump could instead be facing a trial in the Senate and another in federal court which could well wind up result in him having to pay back tens of millions of dollars to the very people he cheated with his bogus university. And if he were found guilty of racketeering, Trump could even be sent to federal prison where he belongs. Hey, Donald: Don’t get too excited on election night. It may turn out to the beginning of the end for you. Featured Image Via Flickr available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License",0,1,0
806,"Here we go again. Cop shoots thug, Black Lives Matter morons riot, cause mass destruction, and cause harm to businesses and people. This is the world we live in, folks,and it’s happening in front of our very eyes…again. And nowhere to be found is our do-nothing president who consistently sides with all the rioters. He couldn’t care less as his racially charged agenda is to divide the US so much that we’re sent back to the civil right movement. Or so it would seem. New Gingrich just called out BLM and Obama for this decay of race relations. It’s put square on their shoulders and we agree with him! Watch below.  “Fifty-three years after Martin Luther King’s ‘I Have A Dream’ speech; eight years after the election of an African-American president…race relations are decaying in this country.” “Schools that don’t work, neighborhoods with no jobs, random violence, a sense of being powerless even though there is an African-American president,” Gingrich said. But there’s another problem here. Whenever there is a riot, Obama speaks out in favor of BLM saying that we need to reform our police and they need to take more responsibility for their actions. However, when countless thousands are killed in inner city black on black crime across the country, specifically in Chicago, Obama’s hometown, he doesn’t bat an eye. Because it doesn’t fit his agenda. He lamented the fact that major Democratic leaders have not intently reacted to repeated events of anti-police protests and urban violence. “Over 3,000 people shot in Chicago…but no national reaction: Obama doesn’t notice it, Clinton doesn’t notice it.” “The country at large will not tolerate this kind of random violence. People will not tolerate looting…closing Interstate 85– burning things.” What we need is someone who can restore order to things. This must end. Police must be vigilant and arrest anyone who riots. We need a president who can stop all this, not Obama who only ads fuel to the quite literal fires. Read more here… ",0,0,1
1122,"Donald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a “wounded country” that “looks bad to the world.” Pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal America’s racial divide. Story Continued Below “Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,” Trump said. “America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we’ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.” He called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a “national crisis.” He also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing “the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers” and sympathized with police officers, who carry an “immense responsibility” but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obama’s leadership, or lack thereof. “We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it’s — we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,” Trump said. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?” Trump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president’s responsibility “to address this crisis and save African-American lives,” has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign. Trump's overtures to black voters — often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences — have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that “drugs are a very, very big factor” in what's happening in Charlotte. Still, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with “Fox and Friends,” the Republican presidential nominee said there “just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.” “I mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he continued. “You’re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte — a great place — and you just see it.” Protests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte. By Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott’s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family’s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video ""can somehow help us reach that truth."" Justin Bamberg, another of the family’s attorney’s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that “pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.” He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott’s wife was present when he was shot. “At the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,” Bamberg said when asked why the family’s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. “Yes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.” The Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday. Attorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the “difficulties” her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. “I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,” she said. “But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully. “Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,” he said. “We've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.” Wednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said. “I see it even going out. There’s such a lack of — there’s a lack of spirit,” Trump said. “There’s a lack of something. Something’s going on that’s bad, and what’s going on between police and others is getting worse.” The real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot. “Well, it’s wow, here we go again,” Trump said. “It’s very sad. When you look at what’s going on, it’s very sad. It’s very divided, our country, and it’s getting worse. I’m not overly surprised to see it, but it’s happening.” Trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won’t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more. “If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,” Trump said. “And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was — that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there’s something deeper than that.” What’s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America’s current leader. “Well, it really has to be — you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there’s no unity,” Trump said. “You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It’s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it’s so sad to see. But there’s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.” But what Trump didn’t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama’s lack of leadership. “First of all, it’s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we’ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that’s a tragic failure of leadership,” Gingrich said. “But my guess is he was afraid it’d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,” he added. “He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.” Giuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday’s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was “a more difficult situation” than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the “ambiguous, troubling category.” “But even there, you gotta say to people, ‘Wait, let the investigation play out.’ The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,” Giuliani said. “The president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.”",1,0,0

199,"Thereâs already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable â except by Hillary Clinton. But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong: While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics â¦.Â Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage. After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates. The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters: For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator â¦ to call out those lies and to do that in real time. Unfortunately, with Trumpâs impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, itâs somehow up to Hillary Clinton to âshineâ at the debate if she hopes to âwin.â This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent. Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it. If there is one thing this election has shown us, itâs that journalism is dying, if not already dead. ",0,1,0
17,"Today marks the one-week mark ahead of the first of the three presidential debates during the 2016 campaign and the candidates are gearing up. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced today the broad topics that are slated to be covered during the first debate: America's Direction, Achieving Prosperity and Securing America. The topics were selected by the moderator, Lester Holt of ""NBC Nightly News,"" but are ""subject to possible changes because of news developments."" The commission also made its final decision on Friday that there would only be two candidates taking the debate stage on Monday, Sept. 26. It ruled that neither Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson nor Green Party nominee Jill Stein had met the 15 percent mark in a combination of polls, which had previously been set as the bar for participation qualification.       Before Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Clinton head to Hofstra University, the site of the first debate, the candidates and their campaign aides have started teasing their debate prep strategies. Trump started his debate prep in late August, and at the time, sources told ABC News that he hadn't participated in mock debates, which is one of the more typical prep strategies for presidential candidates. As for Trump's personal debate strategy, he hasn't talked about the specifics of his game plan, focusing more on how he will deal with facing one opponent head on. ""I will treat her with great respect unless she treats me in a certain manner, in which case that will be the end of that,"" Trump said about Clinton last week during an appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News show. ""But I'm certainly starting off with the feeling that I'm going to treat her with great respect. I hope we can talk about policy and certain things. I am not looking to go in and treat her with disrespect."" Clinton's press secretary Brian Fallon told MSNBC last Thursday that she won't ""go in there seeking to provoke Donald Trump."" ""She's going to do what she always does which shows she got the grasp of the issue and the command and poise of being commandeering chief. That contrast there will speak for itself,"" Fallon said.",1,0,0
1580,"Snopes.com has long been regarded as the gold standard for fact-checking internet myths, hoaxes and viral stories. When you see your friends share something that seems kind of crazy, you can visit Snopes and get the truth. Or can you? There have been allegations of liberal bias at Snopes. They only added political fact-checking to their site relatively recently and it is not often honest. Instead, it tends to be about putting liberal spin on issues that Democrats need to have covered. And now we know why: their lead fact-checker is a failed liberal blogger.   LaCapria originally tried to begin her blogging career at the Inquisitr, a site ironically known for its hoaxes, fake quotes and satire. She was not successful there, perhaps due to her open liberal bias. She referred to members of the Tea Party as “teahadists,” for example. So of course, that bias bleeds over into her “fact checking.” Take Facebook, for example. It’s known now that Facebook employees were made to hide conservative stories that were trending. LaCapria, however, discounted this as just “rumors.” When Hillary made her, “We didn’t lose a single person in Beghazi” gaffe, LaCapria dismissed that as well, suggesting that Hillary was referring to a 2011 invasion, rather than the 2012 attack.   It goes on and on with LaCapria and at Snopes in general. While they may do a good job at debunking UFO rumors and internet hoaxes, they perhaps should leave politics alone, as they clearly can’t leave their bias at the door. ",0,0,1
856,"In another disgusting display of Donald’s Trump selfish priorities, the Republican presidential nominee rushed to defend himself and the ignorant comments he made on the New York City bombings immediately after the attack, before having any official information on the matter whatsoever. Facing major backlash from the media for his audacity, Donald Trump decided to double-down on his irresponsible comments instead of admitting he had spoken out of turn. “The Donald” claimed that not only was he was right to rush to call the attack a “bomb,” he also deserved credit from the media for having “predicted it” before they confirmed it, when in fact the media was busy doing their due diligence to present the facts and not report the event so carelessly. Trump went on Fox News to say, “What I said was exactly correct. I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news. But what I said was exactly correct and everybody says, “While he was right, he called it too soon.” Donald Trump’s priorities are clearer now more than ever. Time after time, whenever tragedy strikes, Trump finds a way to make it about himself – no condolences for the 29 injured, and his self-aggrandizing knows no bounds, even when there are American lives at stake, and sensitive material that needs to be treated with careful consideration.

UPDATE: Elizabeth, NJ mayor says five devices found in bag near train station. One exploded while bomb squad robot tried to disarm it — Fox News (@FoxNews) September 19, 2016  The latest bomb scare comes just one day after two other bombs exploded (one in Seaside Park, New Jersey and one in Manhattan) and three more were found by authorities before they could be detonated. Late Sunday evening authorities announced that they believed all five bombs from Saturday were the work of the same people, then later in the night they announced that they had made five arrests in connection with the bombs. Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a “vehicle of interest” in the Chelsea bombing Sunday night in Brooklyn. A law enforcement source told Fox News that a “number of individuals” who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. Law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that at least 5 men were being questioned. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about an ongoing investigation.

The shooter then began running down the street with several police cars trailing him, the witness, Peter Bilinskas, said. After days of pretending that the bombings were not the work of Islamic terrorists it seems that New York’s liberals are finally beginning to understand the truth.

779,"What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America. We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency. Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported: “We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.” Watch below:  Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.  We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield? I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two. ",0,0,1

276,"Party People is a new podcast from CNN where a pair of conservative CNN contributors talk to influential voices about the future of conservatism and the Republican party. Washington (CNN)If Donald Trump thinks his dominance in the Republican primary debates will translate to success in next week's matchup against Hillary Clinton, Lanhee Chen thinks the GOP nominee is in for a surprise. ""He can't fake his way through 90 minutes,"" Chen, a research fellow Hoover Institution and a CNN contributor, told CNN's Party People podcast hosts Kevin Madden and Mary Katherine Ham. Trump participated in debates throughout the Republican presidential primary schedule, emerging largely unscathed in the polls after fighting off more than a dozen GOP presidential primary opponents, and locking up the party's nomination by May. Clinton prepares for unpredictable Trump at debate Chen, a Republican policy wonk who worked for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on their respective presidential campaigns, said the general election debates present a different challenge -- in part because he'll have just one other opponent and an increased focus on substance. ""The 90-minute general election format makes it a lot harder to one line your way through it,"" Chen said, adding, ""I think it's going to be very, very hard for Donald Trump to spend 90 minutes bumper-stickering. I think he's got to have something."" Chen said Clinton faces her own challenges in the general election debates -- the first of which is on Monday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. ""I think for Hillary Clinton the challenge is: How does she expose the deficiencies in what he said or proposed without sounding pedantic?"" Chen said. ""She's going to sound like the teacher that nobody likes. And nobody wants to hear the teacher they don't like lecturing them for 90 minutes."" Chen, whose background is in developing conservative policy ideas, said that if Trump wins the presidency then the real estate mogul would likely outsource setting his policy agenda to his running mate Mike Pence or House Speaker Paul Ryan. ""Either way, Paul Ryan plays a big role,"" Chen said. ""Paul Ryan is like 'How many thankless jobs can one man take?'"" Ham added.

245,"(CNN)One of the big winners at the Emmys on Sunday night delivered some of the harshest criticism of Donald Trump offstage -- comparing the Republican presidential nominee to Adolf Hitler and warning against what she said were efforts to ""otherize"" groups of people. Jill Soloway, creator of Amazon's ""Transparent"" and winner in the comedy series directing category, spoke to ""Variety"" backstage during the awards show, where she lit into Trump. ""Jews were other-ized in Nazi Germany to gain political power for Hitler, and right now Donald Trump is doing the same thing. He's other-izing people. He calls women pigs if they don't look like beauty pageant contestants. He blames Muslims and Mexicans for our problems. He makes fun of disabled people. This is other-izing with a capital 'O,'"" Soloway said. She continued, ""It has been used in our history before to start and win wars. He needs to be called out at every chance he gets for being one of the most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes. He's a complete dangerous monster, and at any moment that I have to call out Trump for being an inheritor to Hitler, I will."" CNN has reached out to Trump campaign for comment and not yet received a response. With the criticism, Soloway delivered one of the sharpest Trump condemnations at the awards show -- but she was far from alone, as the program featured a series of actors, directors and producers who slammed the GOP nominee. ""Transparent"" lead actor Jeffrey Tambor, another winner who was backstage during the exchange, said he agreed, according to Variety. And he reportedly quoted the poet W.H. Auden, saying ""Love one another or die."" David Mandel -- the showrunner of HBO's ""Veep,"" which also won multiple awards, and who was also present backstage -- joked that his show, which satirizes politics, couldn't keep up with Trump. ""There are days when things we think of pale in comparison to that mad man threatening Hillary Clinton not once but twice,"" Mandel said, according to ""Variety."" ""If I wrote that, I'd get fired by HBO. I find the level of discourse in this campaign horrific."" He added, ""A lot of people don't want to laugh about this stuff."" ",1,0,0
183,"If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn. Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine. Mrs. Obama told host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made. “When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it’s fast,” the First Lady said.

898,"Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were not pleased when Rina Shah appeared on Fox News for Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin last Friday, September 16, 2016. And one of them left a hateful, racist voice mail for her at McMullin’s campaign office. Ms. Shah and the McMullin campaign turned this awful-tasting lemon into lemonade – in the form of a campaign ad. Evan McMullin was a Republican. At the beginning of August, he announced his Independent candidacy for president as an alternative to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Rina Shah is a political and media consultant who joined McMullin’s campaign staff as Communications Director in mid-August 2016. Shah was born in West Virginia to Indian American parents.  She has been a commentator on the PBS program “To the Contrary” and she founded Rilax Strategies, a political consulting firm. Shah said to BuzzFeed that this wasn’t the first time she’s received such messages: “I could send you, I’m not kidding, hundreds of emails I’ve received … You know, ‘You’re a Muslim,’ ‘You’re a C-U-N-T’ — I get a lot of, ‘Go back to your country.’” The caller identified himself only as “Alan.” BuzzFeed tracked him down and learned that his name is Alan Pryce. Once the transcript of the message was read to him, Pryce claimed it and said he: “…Stands by every word.”   Mr. Pryce seems to have the same loose relationship with the truth as the candidate he supports. He did not know, for example, that Ms. Shah was born in the United States. His reaction: “Really? Well, she’s absolutely a first-gen whatever. Look, I didn’t do a biography on her.” He continued: “Clearly, she’s an anti-American supporter of a pathological, lying criminal. Anyone who supports [Hillary Clinton], either actively or tacitly, is anti-American scum in my mind.” BuzzFeed reported that Pryce says he was disabled by an undocumented immigrant. He would not give any details, so BuzzFeed could not confirm his story. Pryce had some choice words for McMullin, too (“cuckservative,” which is straight from the alt-right‘s racist playbook). But he doesn’t mind at all being part of the McMullin campaign’s ad. He thinks it’s “hysterical.” Watch the ad with Alan’s message, but be warned that it’s language is quite graphic:  Featured Image: Screenshot Via YouTube Video.",0,1,0
1541,"CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation. Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.  From TruthFeed: “You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many.   “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars. Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed. The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement. Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic. This is a coup from without and from within… the enemy is now among us. ",0,0,1
786,"Incredible. Democrat asks a question, Republican has an answer, a powerful answer. Democrat proceeds to get mad, and uses interruption and deceiving chain of words and emotions to keep the powerful answer from being heard. Not only is that terribly embarrassing…but the Democrat just ends up looking like a total asshat. In this case…it seems like Randy Perkins (said Democrat) needs some serious ‘anger management’ therapy. I mean, the man went from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds flat! On a topic he couldn’t digest himself…but was the very person to bring it to the plate! Classic Dem… Randy “Hot Head” Perkins is running for Congress in Florida’s 18th district. Enter former U.S. Army Special Operations soldier Sgt. Brian Mast, who is his Republican opponent. Mast has served under the Joint Special Operation Command as an Explosives, Ordinance and Demolition Bomb Technician. Basically, he risks his life going one on one with actual bombs, before they detonate and wipe life out…and so much more. In 2010, as he was conducting an operation in Afghanistan, Mast found himself once more coming face to face with an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) that didn’t go down without taking a part of Mast with it. He lost both his legs and suffered great injury to his left arm, and STILL went on to volunteer and serve with the Israeli Defense Forces in Israel. This is the man that you are about to watch on video being unfairly attacked by Randy “Hot Head” Perkins. Keep that in mind as you watch the interaction or lack thereof between the two. Did you see that? Perkins gave nothing but absolute disregard and disrespect to Mast in a situation that he himself, had set up. That’s enough to make you want to reach right into your computer screen and slap that guy. Of course Mast is qualified, and Perkins just helped to prove it. When has anger ever been the method of problem solving? Anger is a good method to get the motivation to problem solve…but is absolutely destructive to use while fixing what needs to be fixed. Who in their right mind wants a man like Perkins in charge? He’s just proven himself to be an ogre! While at the sametime showing people that Mast is level headed, and calm in situations that most people would start swinging fists… Mast is qualified because he has proven he is willing to sacrifice for America and Americans. A great leader possesses values of integrity, accountability, and the ability to keep a good sense of humor, even in troubled times. I’d say Mast just gave a good example of that, thanks to Perkins. He kept cool, and even showed he had good sense of humor when he chuckled a little in disbelief. He made his claims and was asked to prove why they were true, and took no hesitation in doing so, despite Perkins changing the angle every 2 seconds to throw him off. Heck, earlier we wanted to slap Perkins…but maybe we should be thanking him for burying himself? Look, it’s not too hard to divide the good men from the bad when they make it so obvious themselves. However, as further witness of Mast’s good character, you should know that Freedom Daily met with him at CPAC this year. As expected he is a very humble and down to earth guy, even after all the horrors he has witnessed on the battlefield where he has given up his quality of life for you, me and our children. We assure you, this attack that Perkins unleashed on Mast… is absolutely uncalled for. ",0,0,1
1586,"To say that the relationship between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan is a bit tepid would be nothing short of an understatement. Nevertheless, for all of their differences that have been repeatedly highlighted by the liberal media, Ryan has endorsed Trump over Democrat rival Hillary Clinton, and that didn’t change following Monday night’s presidential debate. According to Politico, Ryan broke from some other seemingly disappointed Republicans on Capitol Hill to offer high praise for Trump’s debate performance. “I saw Donald Trump give a spirited voice to those of us who don’t like the status quo, and I see emerging in front of us the potential for what a unified Republican government can get you, which can be the solutions,” Ryan stated Tuesday morning at a press conference. “I think he passed a number of thresholds … and showed that for 90 minutes he could go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton,” he added. Other GOP members thought Trump could have done better, though, and several lamented the many “missed opportunities” where Trump could have landed damaging blows against Clinton over a host of problem issues for her — except that he didn’t even take a swing. Nevertheless, Trump was not hung out to dry by his fellow Republicans after the debate, and the high praise from Ryan showed that at least some in the GOP establishment have apparently come to terms with Trump as potentially the next president. In other words, don’t believe all the stories about disunity from a left-leaning media that fears victory by a consolidated Republican Party.

1321,"Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals. “They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.” Story Continued Below Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit. “I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.” “Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.” Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator. ""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America. Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised. “I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue."" While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with. “I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.” Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" “I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”",1,0,0

However, whenever I encounter anti-American vitriol that masquerades as “enlightened” political correctness, I always wonder, “If you hate what this country stands for, then why do you live here?” That’s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event’s “American theme” because it is supposedly offensive.   Students at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey, were planning on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty. The theme was “America.” As students made preparations for the event, however, they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “offensive.” The staffer who issued the edict, Bischoff Hall Assistant Residence Director Ariana Rivera, claimed that, among other things, the use of Uncle Sam on flyers was too “military and recruitment-oriented.” Because college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the Army? Doubtful… Rivera claimed that the order came from the administration. When asked who was issuing the order, she replied, “To be honest, I’m not sure. I think it was administrative. I was told that our advertising was too ‘military and recruitment-oriented,’ because we had the Uncle Sam saying ‘I want you.’ I think? However, we saw other posters with that same idea, so I really don’t know.” The event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance. College officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “miscommunication.” Still, students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place. In either case, what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism, but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly without ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why. “Because we said so” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants.

A schoolyard fight was caught on camera again, but it goes down quite differently than what you would expect, based off the first couple seconds of the brutal recording. One part that will have you disgusted with the tactics used by two bullies and another part will reveal that racist hate groups like BlackLivesMatter and The New Black Panthers aren’t as influential as the liberal media would have you believe.  You are going to witness how the color of one’s skin doesn’t keep you segregated as these hate groups would have you think and believe. As the clip opens up, a white male student is seated at a bench on school property, playing with his phone, when all of the sudden, two black students swing on him from behind. The first punch lands square on the kid’s jaw and he’s left with the only option of curling up in a defensive position. The two bullies are throwing punches as fast as they can, hitting their victim anywhere they can connect. All seems lost for the victim at first…until two students, one male and one female, step in to even the odds and protect the defenseless boy. Oh, and guess what? They’re black.   Now, it shouldn’t be a surprise to the majority of Americans living today that these two good Samaritans would stick up for another white student. The color of one’s skin isn’t a measure of the heart and if you don’t believe that, you are either a progressive racist, or you are an elderly racist living out life in the past. That’s not American.

1449,"Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there. The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.  From The Daily Caller: A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’. Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

321,"United Nations (CNN)President Barack Obama took to the most prominent international stage Tuesday to deliver a stark warning to American voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in November. Never mentioning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name, the President's final address to the United Nations General Assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the GOP candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. He painted a dark picture of the future awaiting Americans, and the world, if the forces of ""aggressive nationalism"" or ""crude populism"" win out. And he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of Trump's proposal on border security. ""A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama declared to the assembled representatives of the UN's member states. Gone were Obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous UN addresses. The ""hope and change"" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. ""Time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate,"" Obama suggested. ""We have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war,"" Obama said. ""Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history."" He pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created ""an uncertainty and unease and strife"" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. ""I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,"" Obama said. ""We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back."" It was Obama's eighth and final address to the UN body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor George W. Bush. In his speech that year, Obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. But in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for Obama and the UN. The organization's inability to stem suffering in Syria and Ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while Obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. Obama's address Tuesday reflected those realities. He drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged General Assembly hall when he noted that ""at times both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington. And perhaps too many in Washington believe that, as well."" He made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. ""The world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife,"" Obama said. ""Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface."" RELATED: Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons Obama continued his tradition at the UN of acknowledging areas where the US has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. Citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, Obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. ""Those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. Because both the facts and history is on our side,"" Obama said. ""We better strive harder to set a better example at home."" Obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of US leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. He also cited the deal with Iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with Cuba and Myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. RELATED: Global leaders at UN tackle world's worst to-do list But the array of places where Obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. That includes his inability to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians -- a major topic in his first four UN addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. This year, the President took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. He criticized Israeli settlements, saying the only path to Mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. Palestinians must ""reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel,"" Obama said. But he also said peace won't come until ""Israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land."" Obama plans to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to ""discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,"" according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. Another persisting crisis -- Russia's continued incursion into Ukraine -- also drew Obama's attention Tuesday. ""In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,"" Obama said. ""If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. It may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. Over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure."" Indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. ""There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now,"" he told the assembled leaders. ""And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.""

What if that person is … Obama? Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004. Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article. It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:  Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.  And the link to the original. That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991. That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote: Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead. If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain? If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly. Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency. The quote can be read in context at Breitbart. ",0,0,1
281,"Washington (CNN)The National Rifle Association is returning to the defense of Donald Trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, a reminder of how fervently the gun-rights group has backed the Republican nominee on television. The NRA is launching a $5 million TV ad campaign Tuesday, the group says, meant to turn out pro-Second Amendment voters at a time when Trump is being attacked for his language about firearms. The gun lobby has aired $7.7 million in television time on Trump's behalf, support that makes it the second-most active pro-Trump advertiser in the general election. But it had not been on the airwaves since late last month. The NRA's Political Victory Fund is tasked with spending half the money on five swing states -- Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania -- while its Institute for Legislative Action, its lobbying arm, is spending the second-half on national cable. All of the money is going to a harrowing ad that shows what the NRA says would happen if Hillary Clinton appoints her chosen justices to the Supreme Court. ""She'll call 9-1-1. Average response time? 11 minutes,"" says the narrator as a sleeping woman is startled by nighttime footsteps. The woman runs to a nearby safe to grab her weapon, but it's empty. ""Don't let Hillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone."" The advertisements targets rural voters in battleground states who might be Democrats or disillusioned Republicans, according to Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman. ""It is designed to run up the score with those Trump voters,"" she said. The NRA's chief political adviser Chris Cox said the ad ""underscores"" how Clinton's position on guns creates ""one set of rules for her, and a different set of rules for the rest of us."" Trump has emerged as a proud spokesman for gun rights, though he has at times invited controversy. On multiple occasions, Trump has been attacked for encouraging gun-owners to incite violence against Clinton, though Trump's campaign has said he is being misinterpreted. ""I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately,"" Trump said in Miami last week. ""Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her."" ",1,0,0
1138,"A spokesperson for the New York Police Department said “detectives are looking into” a report that former congressman Anthony Weiner traded sexually explicit messages with a girl who identified herself as a 15-year-old high school student. The exchange was first reported by the Daily Mail yesterday, which withheld the name of the girl because she is a minor. Story Continued Below Later Thursday, CNN reported that U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office has subpoenaed Weiner for his cell phone and other records. Weiner yesterday referred reporters to a statement he had given the Daily Mail, saying he regretted his online conversations but pointing to a letter the girl wrote calling the incident “a hoax.” The girl later recanted that characterization, and shared with the Daily Mail a series of images and messages she said she traded with Weiner up until July. Weiner’s 2013 mayoral campaign was rocked by revelations that he had traded sexually explicit messages with a woman after he had resigned from office in 2011. Weiner's resignation was prompted by an exchange with another woman that he accidentally posted to his public Twitter feed. Mayor Bill de Blasio today said today the situation is ""horrible."" ""I've known Anthony over the years, but I know Huma much better, having served side by side with her during the 2000 Senate campaign,"" said de Blasio, who managed Hillary Clinton's campaign for the U.S. Senate that year. ""I think the world of Huma. I just feel horrible for her and her son that they're going through this. It's not a secret, Anthony obviously has a real problem that needs treatment, and all I can say is I hope he will pursue the treatment he needs and stick with it until his issues are addressed.""

""Hillary is grateful for, and intends to honor, the invitation from faith leaders to visit with the Charlotte community. After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday's trip as to not impact the City's resources. She will plan to visit Charlotte next Sunday, provided circumstances allow. In the meantime her prayers are with the people of Charlotte during these difficult days."" Donald Trump quickly responded to Clinton's reversal, tweeting that Clinton was trying to ""grandstand"" and calling her initial decision to go to Charlotte ""dumb."" ""Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!"" Trump was reportedly considering going to Charlotte next week but has not elaborated on those plans. He incorrectly identified Clinton's initial trip as scheduled for Saturday. Clinton has called for Charlotte police to release video footage of the confrontation between officers and Keith Lamont Scott, the African-American man whose fatal shooting by a police officer Tuesday ignited recent protests. Clinton wrote on Twitter Friday: ""Charlotte should release police video of the Keith Lamont Scott shooting without delay. We must ensure justice & work to bridge divides.""

I think the night should have been called “The Roast of Hillary Clinton,” because she got wrecked and her lies came back in full force to destroy any argument she had against Trump. Hillary not only started floundering, but Trump turned her into a stuttering mess, complaining that she’s being picked on, as if Trump was some schoolyard bully instead of a major political candidate that called her out on her countless lies.

1230,"Obamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama’s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago. They’re not laughing anymore. Story Continued Below Going into Monday night’s debate, Obama’s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn’t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they’re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they’ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president’s aides – current and former – now concede, they’re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama. “I’m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,” said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “I feel like we’re maybe in the fifth season of ‘Breaking Bad’ here. We’re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.” “There's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,” said another former senior Obama campaign staffer. Privately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He’s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it’s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who’ve benefited from his policies—like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare—support Democrats. For Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump’s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on ‘hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there’s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money. “We are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,” said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. “But we’re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.” Trump’s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette. And the result: Trump’s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama’s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states. Though only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president’s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama’s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies. “I don’t think he thinks it’s his legacy, I don’t think any of us think it’s his legacy,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. “Trumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.” But they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama’s America. “I think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he’s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,” said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. “He’s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.” For any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, “Trump has shattered that,” Vietor said. “He has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn’t matter if it’s a low blow, it doesn’t matter if it’s not of substance. That’s a bad lesson for people to learn.” According to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he’d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it’s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton’s chances. “I’m not saying we’d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign. Not everyone’s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains. “He's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,” said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan. And Democrats’ sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that’s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble. “The eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,” said Earnest, “is intellectually bankrupt—or about something other than the economy.” But that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics. “I’d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,” Papa said, “than have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.”",1,0,0

I wanna build on the progress that President Obama has made during a very tumultuous time,” Clinton told host Steve Harvey on the radio program “The Steve Harvey Morning Show.” “I mean, I’m appalled that Donald Trump will not apologize to the president and to the country for spending years questioning his citizenship and attempting to delegitimize him. And President Obama and Michelle Obama, they’ve kept their heads high. Like Michelle says, when they go low, we go high. And we gotta stay high. We’ve gotta stay focused.” Story Continued Below Trump on Friday made a much-hyped announcement regarding the conspiracy theory the now-Republican presidential nominee began pushing years ago. His statement, however, lacked an apology and falsely pinned the blame on Clinton for igniting the so-called “birther” issue. “Hillary Clinton started the ‘birther’ controversy,” Trump said, though fact-checkers have found no connection between the conspiracy theory and Clinton or her presidential campaign. “I finished it. Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making the United States great again.” Clinton was itching to hammer Trump during the interview, which began with a remark about the importance of voter registration and the threat of a Trump presidency before transitioning into light topics like what Clinton's and Harvey's grandchildren should call them (Clinton laughed at Harvey’s pitch for what his grandkids should call him — “Big Pimpin’” — and said her granddaughter calls her “Grandma” and former President Bill Clinton “Pop-pop”). “Oh my gosh, can I have the whole hour?” Clinton said when asked what separates her from Trump. “I think it really comes down to our visions and our values.

In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings. Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling. “Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.” But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.” BOOM.  Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions!

921,"Trump repeated tonight one of his favorite fear-mongering lies: that crime is dangerously out of control in American cities. Specifically, he cited Chicago – which he emphasized is “Obama’s hometown” – as an example of a place plagued by out of control crime. In reality, however, crime rates in all categories have been consistently declining over the past decade and a half – albeit with a recent almost statistically insignificant spike in murder in some select cities. As for Chicago, crime – both violent and otherwise – has been consistently declining since about 2001. There has indeed been a spike in homicides over the past few years, but even this year’s exceptional murder count will not exceed the almost 700 murders tallied in the early Bush years, much less the almost one thousand annual murders in the 1990s. In fact, the annual murder and violent crime rate in Chicago under President Obama has been lower than any other time in decades.  The decrease in crime in Chicago corresponds with nationwide trends. Since the 1990s violent crime in all areas and all categories has declined tremendously. There has indeed been a recent uptick in murders in a few cities but the overall trend remains incontrovertible downward. That’s just the facts. These facts, however, don’t sit well with a demagogic fearmonger like Donald Trump, who relies on fear and hatred to mobilize his support. In the midst of tonight’s debate Trump even deployed the archetypal line of the dictator-to-be: “we need law and order.” And Trump is not going to let the facts get in the way of his delusional plots.

1144,"Donald Trump feels like a man half his age, and Hillary Clinton is “quite delighted” that the topic of the septua- and sexagenarian’s ages haven’t been an issue throughout their presidential campaigns. Both candidates responded to AARP Bulletin for the cover story of its October issue, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO on Thursday. Trump issued written responses to six of AARP’s 13 questions earlier this month; Clinton answered every question during her face-to-face interview in August. Story Continued Below Trump, 70, and Clinton, 68, were told that age doesn’t seem to be a factor in their campaigns and asked if they feel that’s “a fundamental change in the views of Americans toward aging.” Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, boasted about how young he feels, echoing what he told Dr. Mehmet Oz during an interview last week in which he said when he looks in the mirror he sees a man half his age. Trump’s response also included a knock on the Democratic nominee, who recently took some time off the campaign trail to recover from a bout of pneumonia. “Yes. Many Americans are living longer, healthier, fulfilling lives,” Trump wrote in response to the question. “As I’ve said before, I feel like I’m 35. Stamina and energy are important. As is a positive attitude and joy for how you spend your days.” During her interview, Clinton expressed her delight in the subject of age being a relatively non-factor this cycle. But she also spoke to the importance of available, affordable health care, a signature accomplishment of President Barack Obama, and how she wants that for everyone. “I have been quite delighted at the outcomes of the [campaign] for many reasons, but certainly because there don’t seem to be any arguments about age,” Clinton said. “People can argue about our policies, our experiences, but I think it goes to show that what we are seeing happen is that if you take care of yourself, if you can afford good health care and get it, you can live a full and productive life much longer than people in prior generations did.” “That’s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to feel they are at their best and that they’re able to continue to make a contribution and enjoy life as best as they possibly can,” she continued. “So I appreciate the emphasis on healthiness and wellness, and that’s something that I want to try to promote in the White House and get older people, not just younger people, to be paying attention—to really take advantage of opportunities and to do more. So I’m excited by what I see as a real opportunity for us to break down the barriers that age has historically posed and to really help people to focus on how they can be as healthy and well as possible for as long as possible.”",1,0,0

802,"It’s been said that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, but in the case of the Minnesota mall attacker, to quote another cliche, he brought a knife to a gun fight. Last Saturday set the bar for the poorest execution of a terrorist attack to date. Five explosives were planted around the tri-State area, killing nobody. One bomb was supposed to detonate during a 5k race for veterans – but detonated before the race even began. Another explosive went off in NYC that night, but despite injuries, nobody was killed.  Also occurring on Saturday was a machete attack in a mall in Minnesota. Nine were injured during the attacks, where the attacker was shouting “Allah Akbar” during (but the media still thought there was a debate over the motives for the attack). Eventually he was shot numerous times and killed. The man who killed him was an off-duty police officer, an instructor of a concealed carry class, and a competitive shooter. In other words, a good guy with a gun that even Allah couldn’t save him from. For the first time since the incident, he’s speaking out. As ABC News reported: The off-duty police officer who shot and killed the knife-wielding Minnesota mall attacker said he is staying out of the spotlight until the investigation is over but is grateful for all the messages of support he has received. Jason Falconer, who has been hailed a hero by many Americans, including the president, went right back to work after bravely intervening in Saturday’s stabbing attack at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, according to local ABC News affiliate KSTP-TV. Dahir Ahmed Adan, 20, began stabbing people at the shopping center; 10 suffered injuries. None of the injuries are life-threatening, authorities said. Falconer shot Adan dead, and authorities believe his quick action saved lives. Falconer spoke to KSTP-TV at Tactical Advantage, a firearms shop where he is an employee. He said he was at the mall on Saturday “buying his son’s birthday present,” which he was able to take home, despite the horrific scene that unfolded. Falconer said he shot at Adan “to stop the threat.” Countless others were spared from being hacked, potentially to death, thanks to Falconer’s actions. Japanese Marshal Admiral and the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet during World War II Isoroku Yamamoto once famously stated that you can’t invade mainland America, “because there would be a rifle behind every blade of glass.” Unlike our neighbors across the sea in Europe, we’re armed to the teeth, and any Jihadi who tries to wreck havok is in for one hell of a surprise.

1393,"I’m probably going to a very not good place for laughing at this, but I can’t help that it’s so dang funny!  There has been a theory floating around that Hillary Clinton is just a robot disguised as a human. While that may seem out-of-this-world ridiculous, remember that she admitted to “short-circuiting.” I’m fairly confident that this is not a term that people often use to describe their forgetting something of importance. And then, adding to the pile of evidence to validate this theory is this little gem picked up from the Twitterverse:  Some guy right in Hillary’s face: HILLARY FOR PRISON Hillary: LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN I almost feel sorry for her https://t.co/CKfdSuASHB — Jenna Abrams (@Jenn_Abrams) September 18, 2016   When some man yells “Hillary For Prison!” right in her face, Hillary responds with a strangely enthusiastic “Let’s make it happen!” Now I’ve never been to prison so I’m not entirely confident about this, but it would seem that it’s not a place that you would be that excited to go to. If that doesn’t have you rolling on the floor with laughter, this screengrab might:  Awesome. Just… awesome.  ",0,0,1
279,"United Nations (CNN)President Barack Obama took to the most prominent international stage Tuesday to deliver a stark warning to American voters of the dire global consequences they face should they embrace isolationism and ultra-nationalism in November. Never mentioning Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump by name, the President's final address to the United Nations General Assembly was at heart an impassioned rebuke of the GOP candidate's policies on trade, immigration and multiculturalism -- and a defense of liberalism and tolerance -- delivered 49 days before votes are cast for his replacement. He painted a dark picture of the future awaiting Americans, and the world, if the forces of ""aggressive nationalism"" or ""crude populism"" win out. And he specifically inveighed against building a wall -- a centerpiece of Trump's proposal on border security. ""A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,"" Obama declared to the assembled representatives of the UN's member states. Gone were Obama's idealistic appeals to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons and an agenda focused on peace, as were his previous UN addresses. The ""hope and change"" of his argument as a presidential candidate himself was also replaced by exhortations against a future filled with chaos. ""Time and again human beings have believed they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment, only to repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate,"" Obama suggested. ""We have to remember the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war,"" Obama said. ""Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history."" He pointed to growing divisions and discontent at home that challenge those decisions, and noted that the shortcomings of globalization had created ""an uncertainty and unease and strife"" that required acknowledgement, but not turning inward. ""I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,"" Obama said. ""We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back."" It was Obama's eighth and final address to the UN body, which enthusiastically welcomed him in 2009 after he moved to reverse the unilateral approach of his predecessor George W. Bush. In his speech that year, Obama vowed to work within international bodies to confront the world's crises while pushing an agenda combating climate change and nuclear non-proliferation. But in the intervening years, the harsh realities of diplomacy settled in, both for Obama and the UN. The organization's inability to stem suffering in Syria and Ukraine laid bare the continued struggles to combat breaches of international law, while Obama's own work toward combating violent extremists has failed to stop terrorist groups from committing atrocities. Obama's address Tuesday reflected those realities. He drew titters from the collection of world leaders and diplomats in the high-ceilinged General Assembly hall when he noted that ""at times both America's adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington. And perhaps too many in Washington believe that, as well."" He made scant mention of individual world flash points, choosing instead to offer a more thematic recap of his foreign agenda. ""The world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. And yet our societies are filled with uncertainty and unease and strife,"" Obama said. ""Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface."" RELATED: Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons Obama continued his tradition at the UN of acknowledging areas where the US has fallen short in its practice of democracy, saying his country and other developed nations must set a better example for emerging democracies. Citing the pervasive role of money in politics, entrenched party allegiances and a patchwork of voting laws, Obama said it was up to long-established nations to show the way forward. ""Those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully. Because both the facts and history is on our side,"" Obama said. ""We better strive harder to set a better example at home."" Obama used his own efforts to help revive a stalled economy as an example of US leadership during his tenure, saying other countries would be wise to follow his lead of going after corruption and unfair tax policies. He also cited the deal with Iran to curtain its nuclear program, and reopening of ties with Cuba and Myanmar, as examples of a successful global approach. RELATED: Global leaders at UN tackle world's worst to-do list But the array of places where Obama's approach hasn't yielded the outcomes he projected during his first appearance here in 2009 were also unavoidable. That includes his inability to negotiate peace between Israel and the Palestinians -- a major topic in his first four UN addresses that was entirely absent during last year's speech. This year, the President took issue with both sides' actions toward one another. He criticized Israeli settlements, saying the only path to Mideast peace will come when the two sides reconcile deeply held differences. Palestinians must ""reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel,"" Obama said. But he also said peace won't come until ""Israel recognizes it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land."" Obama plans to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to ""discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,"" according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. Another persisting crisis -- Russia's continued incursion into Ukraine -- also drew Obama's attention Tuesday. ""In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,"" Obama said. ""If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home. It may fuel nationalist fervor for a time. Over time, it's also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure."" Indeed, many of his harshest warnings were aimed at global government practices that damage democracy and liberalism and called for the rejection of strongmen, authoritarian and tribalism. ""There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now,"" he told the assembled leaders. ""And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.""

1348,"Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who vaulted into the political spotlight Monday night as the latest example of Donald Trump’s derogatory remarks about women, said the GOP nominee’s wife, Melania, is “a decoration” with limited English-speaking skills. In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine published Tuesday, Machado drew a clear line between her own immigration story and that of Melania Trump. Both women are former models, but Machado attacked Melania Trump for failing to do more to help those around her as the wife of a prominent political figure. Story Continued Below “I think I speak more English than her,” Machado said. “I don’t see anything about this girl. She’s a doll. She’s a decoration. That is how I see her.” Donald Trump was harshly critical of Machado during her tenure as Miss Universe, calling her Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, the latter a reference to her Hispanic heritage. Machado told Cosmopolitan that those remarks triggered a relapse of her bulimia that took several years to escape. Machado, who was also crowned Miss Venezuela, became an American citizen in August, something she told Cosmopolitan she did specifically to vote against Trump. Tuesday morning, Trump admitted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had gotten under his skin a little bit by bringing up Machado at the debate. He said the pageant winner “gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.” “That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” Trump said on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was Mother Teresa, and it wasn’t quite that way, but that’s OK. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”",1,0,0
333,"(CNN)Even if their preferred candidate wins, a new poll released Wednesday found that supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will feel more relief than excitement. The findings from the Pew Research Center revealed widespread disenchantment toward this year's presidential contest among American voters. Majorities of voters say they are frustrated (57%) and disgusted (55%) with the campaign, dwarfing those who say they are interested (31%), optimistic (15%) and excited (10%). Those lukewarm attitudes even extend to backers of the two major party nominees. Only 25% of Clinton supporters say they would feel excited if she were to win. There was little more enthusiasm among Trump supporters; just 28% would be excited if the GOP nominee triumphs in November. But many more Clinton supporters, 68%, say they would feel relieved if she were to win. Ditto for Trump supporters, 61% of whom say they would also feel relief if he wins. According to Pew, a mere 11% of voters overall say they would feel excited if Trump were to win, virtually the same number (12%) who would be excited if the former secretary of state is victorious. The race between Clinton and Trump represents a battle between two of the least liked major party candidates in history, and Pew's findings are hardly the first to show that voters are largely disappointed with both. A Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found Clinton and Trump to be the two most unpopular presidential candidates in decades. The Pew Research Center report is based on a random sample of 3,941 registered voters who are members of the Center's American Trends Panel. Respondents took the survey between August 16 and September 12 online or by mail, and were originally recruited via nationally representative telephone surveys. Results among registered voters have a margin of sampling error of 2.6 percentage points. ",1,0,0
1401,"When the Miami Dolphins have their first home game of the season Sept. 25 against the Cleveland Browns, they might not have their customary police escort to the stadium. After four Dolphins players refused to stand during the national anthem when it was played prior to their first game against the Seattle Seahawks, the police union in Miami called for a boycott, USA Today reports. Jeffery Bell, the president of the International Union of Police Associations, Local 6020, explained: We’ve asked the deputies and the Broward Sheriff’s Office not to do the details anymore. … I respect their right to have freedom of speech. However, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech temporary while you serve that job or while you play in an NFL game. ... I can only imagine the public outcry if a group of police officers refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or if we turned our back for the American flag for the national anthem. There would be a public outcry and internal affairs complaints a mile long on that. In response, Dolphins star running back Arian Foster replied: “They say it’s not time to do this. Then when is the time? It’s never the time in someone else’s eye.”  In addition to the Dolphins, various players for the New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs, and Seattle Seahawks have protested by either sitting or kneeling during the playing of the national anthem at their games. The protest movement began on Aug. 26 with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Despite the warning issued by Local 6020, three of the four protesting Dolphin players refused to stand when the anthem was played before the Sept. 18 game against the New England Patriots. Only linebacker Jelani Jenkins caved in and complied. Sources: Miami Herald, USA Today  / Photo credit: Miami Herald",0,0,1
1436,"It used to be in ancient times that soldiers that fought for their nations were respected. History doesn’t remember ancient hippies, or archaic anti-war activist groups…probably because they were all killed…anyways, today this kind of despicable behavior is the norm. It’s not uncommon to encounter these kinds of people in your everyday life. They saturate the planet. Of course none of them have ever served their country and most likely would rather sacrifice the life of a human being (not their own) over an animal (Harambe). Not to say that bad soldiers don’t exit. They do. There’s bad guys in every walk of life and that should be expected.  But what happens when you have a memorial monument dedicated to a major battle in your country’s history totally desecrated by a disgusting excuse for a human being? Kelly Martin, 42, incensed public decency when she desecrated, and that’s exactly the word needed here, the monument in broad daylight in Grays, Essex… first in April when there were still Remembrance wreaths that were set upon it. If that wasn’t bad enough, this beastly woman did it again back in June – the day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the Battle of the Somme. Martin, who looked as disheveled as ever, shouted ‘f*** this’ as she was led down to the cells at Basildon Crown Court, on her way to receive her sentence.  Judge John Lodge, the lucky duck that had the privilege of passing sentencing, said: ‘Each of these offences is so serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate. The two cases of outraging public decency involve urinating on a war memorial…Inevitably war memorials were constructed at the center of towns and villages so on a daily basis people could be reminded of the sacrifices made by people who died…People use them as a place around which they congregate and that’s not wrong, but when people take that step further and abuse them by urinating on them that’s a matter the court needs to take very seriously indeed.’ Speaking to the piss monster herself, Judge Lodge said this: ‘What makes your case particularly bad is having been caught doing it one time, when the nation was commemorating the worst battle of the First World War you were caught doing it again in the middle of the day.’ Throw the book at her Judge. She obviously hasn’t learned to be a human being. ",0,0,1
463,"(CNN)Presidential debates are about ideas, tough questions -- and gaffes. The impact of one line zingers can fade after the moment, but gaffes can linger, altering a race and shifting the momentum. Mistakes happen in almost every debate. And as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump meet for their first clash Monday -- 56 years to the date after the famous showdown between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy -- viewers will be on alert for any stumbles that might seal the fate of either candidate. Here are eight of the biggest blunders from nearly six decades of presidential debates: Nixon vs. Kennedy, 1960 The first televised general election debate featured a candidate who understood the power of television and one who didn't. John F. Kennedy, tall, young and confident, looked into the camera and addressed 80 million viewers. Richard Nixon, pale and recovering from the flu, shifted his eyes, looking unfocused as he addressed the questioners rather than the viewers. Nixon was also sweaty and unshaven. People who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon won. People who watched the debate thought Kennedy won. The next day's Chicago Daily News headline summed up the importance of the visuals: ""Was Nixon Sabotaged by TV Makeup Artists?"" Donald Trump's 6 debate tactics It went so badly for Nixon that for the next 16 years, general election candidates avoided televised debates. Ford vs. Carter, 1976 So memorable was President Gerald Ford's gaffe that it made it into his obituary. Asked about the expansion of Russian power in Eastern Europe, Ford flatly denied it. ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration,"" he said. Flummoxed, the moderator gave Ford a chance to modify his response. But Ford stuck by his response throughout the debate, insisting that Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania were all ""independent and autonomous."" Sometimes thought of as ""the accidental president,"" Ford's bumbling response only highlighted the sense among some that he wasn't quite right for the job. Dukakis vs. Bush, 1988 The question wasn't hard. ""Governor,"" CNN's Bernard Shaw asked, ""if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?"" It was an easy opportunity for Michael Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, to sound human. But he whiffed and discussed his ironclad opposition to the death penalty. He talked about how Massachusetts had the lowest murder rate in the country. And he criticized then-Vice President George H.W. Bush over his drug war policies. Poll: Clinton, Trump virtually tied headed into debate What he didn't do in his two-minute response is talk about this wife, Kitty. The next day, Kitty Dukakis called the question shocking and inappropriate. Dukakis later admitted that he made a mistake by answering such a raw question so clinically. Bush vs. Clinton vs. Perot, 1992 Just as an audience member stood up to ask President George H.W. Bush about how the national debt had personally affected him, he checked his watch. And in that moment, he provided Bill Clinton an opening. He also gave viewers of the first presidential town hall the impression that he just didn't care and that he had better things to do with his time. The Arkansas governor pounced, showing his rare gift of connecting with voters by approaching the questioner and painting a picture of a wrecked economy where her friends and neighbors had lost jobs. The debate echoed a New York Times headline months earlier that suggested he was out of touch with average voters—""Bush Encounters the Supermarket, Amazed."" Bush later said that in the moment he was thinking: ""I hate these debates. I'm so glad it's almost over."" Bush vs. Gore, 2000 Vice President Al Gore just couldn't hide his exasperation. Especially not after Republican operatives spliced together a clip of him sighing and sighing again and again during his first presidential debate against George W. Bush. After the sighing reel was circulated, the entire narrative of the first debate changed. The post-debate spin effectively turned a debate night victory into a loss for Gore in the days that followed. Columnists mocked him. And pundits had a talking point. On the ""Today"" show, Katie Couric asked him if his sighing was ""presidential behavior."" Why the debate expectations game is a farce In 2007 Gore looked back and said: ""The sighs, the sighs, the sighs. Within 18 hours, they had turned perception around to where the entire story was about me sighing. And that's scary. That's scary."" Rick Perry vs. his memory, 2011 ""Oops"" is never a word that announces something good. For then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, it announced the beginning of the the end of his bid for the 2012 GOP nomination. In the moment, he started off pretty strong and specific. ""I will tell you. It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone,"" he said, staring at then-Congressman Ron Paul, who was standing next to him. ""Commerce, Education, and the...uh...what's the third one there?"" Finally, he just gave up, after the moderator pinned him down. ""Let's see...I can't, the third one, sorry,"" he said. ""Oops."" (He later remembered that it was the Department of Energy). The rap on Perry was that he wasn't up to the job and the ""oops"" moment underscored it. There was no cleaning this one up. Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney, 2012 In his closing statement for one of the most watched debates in television history, President Barack Obama said it ""was a terrific debate."" He was right -- for Mitt Romney. Some 70 million people watched a flat-footed and lethargic Obama get hammered by a well-prepped and aggressive Mitt Romney. Obama spoke in run-on sentences. Romney spoke in bullet points. A CNN insta-poll of registered voters showed that 67% of registered voters who watched the debate thought Romney won, and just 25% went with Obama. Even Obama's campaign aide, Stephanie Cutter, conceded on CNN that Romney ""scored some points on style."" How Lester Holt is getting ready for Monday's debate Yes, like every available style point. The Republican National Committee released a video ad called ""Smirk"" that showed a split-screen of Romney smoothly ripping Obama, while the president nodded and smirked. Obama's poor performance jolted the race, giving Romney the momentum. At least until the second debate. Marco Rubio vs. Chris Christie, 2016 Four. That's how many times Sen. Marco Rubio pivoted to the exact same soundbite attack on President Obama. Four times -- in five minutes. Dogged by criticisms that he was an inexperienced first-term senator who could deliver a speech but not much else, Rubio provided just the evidence his critics needed. It also likely destroyed any chances he had at a good showing in the New Hampshire primary. He later did something that presidential candidates rarely do -- admit they made a mistake. ""I did not do well on Saturday night, so listen to this,"" he told a crowd after his fifth place finish. ""That will never happen again."" But the damage was done and his campaign never recovered.

719,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said: “Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation. “Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag. “We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities? “We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others. “Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end. “The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that. “There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. “Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations.

938,"S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA. Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that: According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says. Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation. But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. “Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News. Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

493,"Hempstead, New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton stepped onto the debate stage Monday night determined to show that only one candidate is ready to be president. Clinton poked, prodded and quoted Trump's own words, goading the famously thin-skinned Republican nominee. Trump took the bait, repeatedly interrupting angrily or dismissively throughout the night. He couldn't resist attacks, even when it was obvious they would backfire -- such as his criticism of Clinton for dropping off the campaign trail ahead of the debate to prepare. CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims ""Yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for?"" Clinton shot back. ""I prepared to be president."" Here are six takeaways from the first presidential debate: Trump takes the bait Trump is the self-proclaimed counterpuncher, but it was Clinton whose restraint was on display: She waited for Trump to create an opening before she pounced. She let moderator Lester Holt grill Trump about his refusal to release tax returns before delivering her own withering assessment of his insistence that a ""routine audit"" be completed first. ""Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is,"" Clinton said. ""Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be... Maybe he doesn't want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes."" ""There is something he is hiding,"" she said. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? Trump lost his cool -- at a cost. He came close to admitting that he didn't pay federal taxes, saying that ""makes me smart"" and that the money ""would be squandered"" anyway. At another point, he insisted his refusal to pay contractors who'd done work for his businesses was smart. ""I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you,"" Clinton said. Trump, meanwhile, paid the price for his decision to wing it. Unlike the GOP primary debates, where Trump would often disappear while other candidates bickered, only to interject with a zinger, he had no other candidates or aggressive moderators to save him -- and it showed. Despite opportunities to do so, he never hit Clinton on the 2012 Benghazi attacks or Clinton Foundation donors' access to the State Department, and he only briefly mentioned her use of a private email server. All three attacks -- elevated by Trump himself at his rallies -- are at the core of the GOP case that Clinton is untrustworthy. Trump's pitch to blue-collar voters Trump's brightest spots came early in the debate, when he invoked Clinton's 2012 praise of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the ""gold standard"" of trade deals. (Clinton now opposes the deal.) ""You were totally in favor of it,"" Trump said. ""Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, 'I can't win that debate.'"" It was part of a theme he worked hard to drive in the debate's early stages: Clinton, he said, has been in Washington for nearly 30 years, and has done little to improve economic conditions for Americans -- a message that could resonate in manufacturing-heavy states like Ohio and Pennsylvania that are crucial to Trump's electoral math. Attacking Clinton's comments on solar energy powering ""new economic activity,"" Trump said: ""You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions."" After a barrage of Trump attacks, Clinton sarcastically said, ""I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened."" Trump shot back: ""Why not?"" Trump's strained relationship with the truth Trump lied repeatedly Monday night -- including some real whoppers. When Clinton claimed Trump ""thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,"" Trump shot back: ""I do not say that. I do not say that."" Of course, Trump did say that. On November 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" It became the most-retweeted item on Twitter during the debate. He called Holt's factual citation of a 2002 interview in which Trump endorsed the war in Iraq ""wrong, wrong, wrong,"" as fact-checkers disagreed. He falsely blamed Clinton for birtherism. He said murder rates in New York City are climbing, when they are on the decline. And he said Clinton had been fighting ISIS ""her entire adult life."" Clinton was born in 1947; ISIS only formed in the mid-2000s. ""I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume,"" Clinton said at one point. Trump questions whether Russia behind hacks Clinton calls Trump's behavior racist Trump said he knew he'd face questions about his five-year history of birtherism. Yet he had no new answers to offer. When Holt asked why Trump decided to finally acknowledge that President Barack Obama was born in the US, Trump said it was because he wanted to change the topic. ""I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country,"" he said. While falsely blaming Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the questions about Obama's birth, Trump also took credit for bringing up the non-issue in the first place. ""I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate,"" he said. ""And I think I did a good job."" Clinton responded by turning the spotlight back on her GOP foe. ""Well, just listen to what you heard,"" Clinton said. She pointed to the 1970s Justice Department lawsuits that Trump faced over accusations of racial discrimination in housing properties he owned. ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Clinton said. ""And the birther lie was a very hurtful one."" Trump's misplaced aggression Trump has long polled better with men than women -- and that gap could grow after Monday night's debate. He interrupted Clinton dozens of times, and talked over Holt when he tried to interject. He blasted Clinton's ""stamina."" And when Clinton attacked Trump over his remarks about women, Trump proved her point by digging in against an old foe. ""Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,"" Trump said. He zealously defended himself, but didn't attack Clinton with the same gusto. And because of it, Clinton was able to easily move past potential problem areas. Asked about her use of a private email server during her tenure at the State Department, Clinton gave a shorter, simpler answer than she has before. ""I'm not going to make any excuses, it was a mistake,"" she said. Trump shot back that it was ""more than a mistake. That was done purposely."" But then he dropped the topic. Later, he briefly came back to it, saying he'd release his tax returns ""against my lawyers' wishes,"" under one condition: ""I will release them as soon as she releases her 33,000 emails."" The crowd cheered, violating Holt's admonition to keep silent. And then, again, Trump moved on -- never mentioning that James Comey, the FBI director, also harshly criticized Clinton's email practices, and never again returning to the topic. They really don't like each other... ...And it shows. With two debates to go, this is going to get nastier. A preview of what's in store came at the end, when Clinton -- attacking Trump's treatment of women -- called him ""a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs."" She said he'd referred to a Latina beauty contestant as ""Miss Piggy. Then he called her Miss Housekeeping."" An agitated Trump twice asked, ""Where did you find this?"" The woman, 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado of Venezuela, told The New York Times and ""Inside Edition"" this year that Trump repeatedly mocked her weight. Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Trump went into the spin room after the debate -- a move unheard of at general election debates - and credited himself with not taking a shot at Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs. He told Fox News conservative host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity afterward that it seemed inappropriate with Bill and Chelsea Clinton in the front row -- but implied he might in the future. For Clinton's campaign, the challenge will be turning a debate-night victory into sustained success -- pressing the same themes in the days ahead as she attempts to reverse Trump's climb in national and battleground state polls. Trump will have to wait until Oct. 9 for another shot at Clinton. ",1,0,0
1378,"The FBI has just released their snazzy new Wanted Poster for the terrorist who is behind the Chelsea bombing in Manhattan. He is a natural born Afghani and considered armed and extremely dangerous. Ahmad Khan Rahami is 28 years-old and they have his face everywhere now. It has been reported that he has left notes and made calls that indicate there will be more bombings. I’m sure they are looking into his connections with the five bombs found in New Jersey this morning – one of which exploded when a robot approached it. I heard yesterday that they believe the same individual who made the bombs in Manhattan also did the ones in New Jersey. The apartment where this man lived in New Jersey has been raided by the FBI. Undercover agents and members of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force were taking part in the raid above a chicken restaurant. The home was roughly one mile from the site where investigators found the five suspicious devices in a backpack, one of which exploded, outside a train station.  From the Independent Journal Review: Law enforcement released the name and photo Monday of 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami, who is “being sought in connection” with this weekend’s New York City bombing, according to NYPD Spokesman Peter Donald:  The attack injured 29 people in New York City, although fortunately all of those wounded have already been released from hospitals.According to ABC News: Ahmad Khan Rahami, DOB 1/23/88, is wanted by the FBI in connection with at least one NYC-area bombing, the FBI says. The address of a home being searched by FBI agents in Elizabeth, New Jersey is linked to a person with a similar name. The wanted poster is below:  Federal authorities conducted a traffic stop of a “vehicle of interest” in the Chelsea bombing Sunday night in Brooklyn. A law enforcement source told Fox News that a “number of individuals” who are possibly connected to the explosion were taken into custody. It’s laughable that de Blasio and others are now calling it terrorism, but say there is no connection to international terrorists. These guys are liars and deeply stupid. Rahami is the man captured on surveillance footage planting the bombs. There is other physical evidence linking Rahami to the devices that have gone off or been found in New York and New Jersey. The pipe bombs were filled with shrapnel and were meant to create many casualties. We are very lucky no one has died yet. There is now a search on for this guy nationwide and the clock is ticking.

1069,"Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will continue to be paid severance by the campaign through the end of 2016, prolonging concerns of a conflict of interest for CNN, which controversially hired Lewandowski in June to serve as a political commentator. In addition, CNN shot down reports on Wednesday that Lewandowski was being suspended by the channel. “Corey Lewandowski, who is no longer involved in the campaign, continues to receive monthly severance payments,” Trump press secretary Hope Hicks told The Washington Post Wednesday. “The campaign will continue to honor its contract with Mr. Lewandowski, which stipulates he will be paid through the end of the year. These payments are in no way compensation for services rendered.” POLITICO reported on Tuesday evening that the Trump campaign had paid Lewandowski's firm $20,000 in August, according to campaign filings, for ""strategy consulting."" As The Washington Post pointed out, the description of the payment as ""strategy consulting"" appeared to contradict CNN’s claim that Lewandowski was being paid by the Trump campaign only for severance. Campaign employees being paid severance for so long after their departures is unusual, and it's not entirely clear why on the FEC forms the Trump campaign continues to call payments to Lewandowski as ""strategy consulting"" (we've reached out to the campaign for clarification and will update here accordingly). In an appearance on Fox News Radio, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway stressed that the payment is still part of his severance and pointed out that CNN also employs as commentators people who work for pro-Clinton Super PACs. ""He is not part of the campaign, he is a paid adviser on CNN and I think he's excellent in his job, frankly. Corey does not have a formal or informal role with the campaign whatsoever,"" Conway said. Mediaite on Wednesday reported that Lewandowski was being suspended by the channel following the new statement, but a spokesperson for the cable channel said the report was false, and that Lewandowski would be appearing on air later today. CNN President Jeff Zucker had for months defended the cable channel’s decision to hire Lewandowski. On Tuesday, the cable network head said at a company town hall for staff that the network ""needed to bring in voices supportive of the Republican nominee to balance its commentary ranks,"" The Huffington Post reported. Lewandowski has signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Trump campaign, and as part of that agreement agreed to a non-disparagement clause, according to the Associated Press which extends beyond his time working for the campaign. As POLITICO reported earlier this month, Lewandowski has been playing a wider role in the campaign recently, even if he technically is not an official part of it.",1,0,0

822,"I can’t believe this nonsense. You’re going to be mad that I told you this. You’re going to wonder where the toughness of America went and what happened to make people think being a p*ssy is the way to be. When I look at cops, I envision people who are strong, tough, and hard working. Except for that one overweight cop that every station has. You know, the guy who actually eats the donuts. Forget him. He’ll be on desk duty eventually. I’m talking about real cops. The cops I know are all in good shape, work out, and run towards danger. They will save any person that’s in harms way. They don’t care if the person is white, black, or even Muslim. A good cop saves everyone, and that’s what most cops are – good cops. And that’s how it’s supposed to be. But then there’s this idiot from the LA Police Commission who wants cops to run AWAY from armed suspects. Are you kidding me? That’s ridiculous. Cops are trained to eliminate threats, not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver.  The Daily Caller – The Los Angeles Police Commission wants LAPD police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon, warns the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the labor union of the city’s police officers. Hypothetically speaking, if I wanted to rob a bank tonight, could I go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me? I don’t have to stab anyone, I just have to show cops that I have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away. Is that how it works? That opens the Pandora Box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that LAPD might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future. I guess the LAPD won’t be allowed to save lives anymore. Very sad state of affairs if this really happens. I hope every LAPD cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense. Cops are trained for battle and they’re not afraid to eliminate a violent threat. And we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger. Training people to run away, instead of eliminating, will generate a nation of p*ssy cops and that’s not who I want to protect me. ",0,0,1
350,"Washington (CNN)Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements. ""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament. The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday. But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack. ""Be careful what door you open, Mrs. Clinton, because you're not going to want people to be talking about the Clinton Foundation and comparing it to anything that Donald Trump has done in his life, including giving away tens of millions of his own personal money,"" Christie, who is chairing Trump's transition efforts, told radio host Laura Ingraham. Koskinen was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday fielding a barrage of questions from House Republicans at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. House conservatives are pushing articles of impeachment to get rid of the commissioner over his handling of allegations that agency members targeted tea party groups, but it's unlikely any vote will happen before the fall election.

445,"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama said Saturday that the new Smithsonian museum devoted to African-American history elevates the often-overlooked impact of black Americans and will help others better understand the breadth of the American story. ""This national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are,"" Obama, the first African-American president, said at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. ""By knowing this other story we better understand ourselves and each other. It binds us together. It reaffirms that all of us are America, that African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story,"" he added. ""It is central to the American story."" Saturday's opening ceremony for the museum also was attended by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Chief Justice John Roberts. Thousands are expected to have descended on the National Mall this weekend to celebrate the museum's opening. Calling it an ""act of patriotism"" to understand African-American history and the struggles of all Americans, Obama said ""a great nation doesn't shy away from the truth."" ""We're not a burden on America or a stain on America or an object of shame and pity for America. We are America,"" Obama said. ""And that's what this museum explains."" ""Hopefully, this museum makes us talk to each other and listen to each other and see each other,"" he added. Obama also said the museum can provide context to the current national debate on the relationship between law enforcement and black communities that recently made headlines following the police shooting deaths of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Ferguson (Missouri) and Charlotte. But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past, but within the white communities across the nation, we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing,"" he said. ""It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history. It's just a blink in the eye of history,"" Obama continued. Star-studded event Saturday's event included musical performances by Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle and Denyce Graves, as well as appearances by Robert De Niro and Angela Bassett, who read the words of black poets and historians. RELATED: Congressman: Black history museum is 'an American story' The effort to bring this museum to life began decades ago but was finally set in motion in 2003 when Bush signed a bill creating it. Ground was broken in February 2012. The Smithsonian says the museum is the only one in the US exclusively focused on African-American life, history and culture, but organizers say it is also meant to capture the story of all Americans. One of those who have worked for years to see this museum come to life is educator and historian Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the museum. Asked what does it mean to him to see it finally open, he said, ""It means that finally the African-American story on the National Mall is accessible to everybody, and in many ways it means that my ancestors are smiling,"" he told CNN. ""This is framed in a way that this is everybody's story. It is not a black people's story. It is a story of America."" Slavery and freedom at focus Officials said the chronicling of slavery and freedom are the centerpiece of the museum. That exhibit contains such items as a slave cabin from South Carolina, a bill of sale for a 16-year-old girl for $600, shackles used on slaves and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. RELATED: Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violence There is also an exhibition focusing on the fight against segregation, which discusses the era from end of Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Movement. Here, visitors see such things as abolitionist Harriet Tubman's hymn book to a dress Rosa Parks was making shortly before she was arrested for not giving up her seat on a segregated bus; a Tuskegee airplane used to train African-American pilots for World War II flights; a segregated Pullman train car as well as a stool from the Woolworth store where there were sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960; and separate water fountains. A separate section examines the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power era of the 1960s and 1970s and other activism remembering many activists, including Lewis and Dr. Martin Luther King. The museum holds more than 3,000 artifacts -- with many contributed from ordinary Americans from across the country. There are also tens of thousands of other artifacts which have been contributed which could be rotated later into exhibition space. Obama on Trump: 'Even most 8-year-olds' know slavery was a bad time for black people There are also many iconic items celebrating the achievements in sports, music, television and film including Michael Jackson's fedora hat worn during his 1984 ""Victory Tour,"" boxer Muhammad Ali's headgear, musician Chuck Berry's Cadillac, baseball star Jackie Robinson's bat, some of Olympian Gabby Douglas' items as well as a statue honoring American athletes who held their hands up as a demonstration of solidarity during the 1968 Gold Medal ceremony. Obama featured One exhibit honors the legacy of Obama's election. During an interview airing Friday, he voiced his appreciation for all of those whose work helped make the museum happen. ""We were an outgrowth of Frederick Douglass and white abolitionists who partnered with him,"" Obama told ABC News. ""We were the consequence of these Freedom Riders. Of all races. Young people idealistically coming down here and being willing to challenge an unjust system."" Also interesting is the design of the building. Sitting next to the Washington Monument on the National Mall, the exterior is made up of 3,600 bronze-colored panels. The architects of the building drew on imagery from both African and American history for the outer layer, saying they were trying to reach towards the sky to express faith, hope and resiliency.

467,"(CNN)Last year saw an increase in violent crime -- including murder -- compared to 2014, according to new data released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday. The annual findings showed an estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes, up 3.9% from 2014, while the murder rate spiked by 10.8% over the same span. Those crimes include ""murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault,"" the FBI's website said. But the report indicated that violent crime is still below 2006 and 2011 levels for 10-year and five-year comparisons. The numbers are somewhat expected, reflecting both anecdotal and statistical evidence of an increase in violence since last October. That trend has been visible in several large cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and Washington. Other major cities such as New York and Los Angeles have not experienced the same. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the data show ""we still have so much work to do,"" but stressed the overall numbers are down compared to several years ago. ""Violent crime tears at the fabric of our common life -- and so any increase in violent crime is of the deepest concern to me as Attorney General and to the entire Department of Justice,"" Lynch said. The findings are part of the FBI's annual crime data report, which is released around the same time every year. They are certain to figure prominently in this year's presidential race, perhaps as early as Monday evening, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump square off in the first general election debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. A similar trend of increasing violent, concentrated in some cities, appears to have continued into 2016.

But what about situations when all the facts point to gang-related activity that is clearly racial and occurs against whites? That was the case in Atlanta, Georgia several weeks ago when a black gang entered the home of an 83-year-old white woman. That woman, Dorothy Dow, was sleeping in bed when a gang of four black men and women entered her home, beat her and then set her on fire. Dow passed away in the hospital recently from complications from the attack. Her attackers are now being charged with murder. Justin Grady, age 38, Cortavious Deshaun Heard, age 18, Mina Christine Ellery, age 17 and Angel Latrice Harmon age 17 are all being held without bond on charges of ""felony murder and malice murder."" The group entered Dow's home and pulled her from her bed where she was sleeping. One of the gang hit her repeatedly with a pistol, breaking the bones in her hand and her arm. Then Dow was covered in a flammable material and set on fire. She survived burning to death only because she pulled herself to a place where she knew she had kept a gallon jug of water. There she was able to pour the water on herself and put out the fire. Then, with a broken arm, she crawled to her cellphone and dialed 911.   The local news station gives no reasoning about why the attack occurred, but as we well know, had the races been reversed, the entire country would be burning from the Black Lives Matter protests.

1612,"Roughly a half dozen Wells Fargo workers who tried doing the right thing about the bank’s scamming of customers were summarily fired. During his grilling in Washington earlier this week, Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testified that it was company policy to enable whistleblowers to speak out against unethical and fraudulent behavior at the bank. “Each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hands,” Stumpf said. However, Bill Bado, a former Wells Fargo banker in Pennsylvania, claims he had a different experience. Bado was given orders from his supervisors in September 2013 to enroll customers in phony accounts without their knowledge or consent. Bado not only refused, he called the company’s ethics hotline and contacted the bank’s human resources hotline to inform them of the scam. After Bado was let go, the bank’s official reason for his firing was “tardiness.” “I told them that’s not only unethical but illegal,” Bado told CNN Money. “They ruined my life.” A Wells Fargo human resources worker — who elected to remain anonymous to protect their career — also told CNN Money that the corporate headquarters put policies in place that were utilized to take revenge against whistleblowers, like firing them on the spot for showing up two minutes late. Former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said that previous financial reform legislation, like the Dodd-Frank Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act codified protections for workers calling out illegal behavior at financial institutions. “It is clearly against the law for any company (or executives of such companies) to try to suppress whistleblowing,” Pitt told CNNMoney in an email. In early September, Heather Brock was fired from her position as a senior business banker at a Wells Fargo branch in Round Rock, Texas after she spoke up about the dubious sales practices she was asked to carry out. Brock said she endured textbook workplace harassment before eventually being fired. Sabrina Bertrand, who used to work for Wells Fargo in Houston, described pressure from her superiors to open the scam accounts was “unbearable.” “I endured harsh bullying … defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something I didn’t do,”Brock told CNN Money. “I had managers in my face yelling at me,” Bertrand said. “They wanted you to open up dual checking accounts for people that couldn’t even manage their original checking account.” Wells Fargo was recently fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for perpetuating an elaborate scam of opening credit card and checking accounts on behalf of customers who never signed off on them in order to drive sales numbers higher. While 5,300 low-level and mid-tier employees were let go after the scam was exposed, no senior management or compliance officials have been fired as of this writing, and CEO John Stumpf has not yet stepped down.        ",0,1,0
336,"(CNN)Secretary of State John Kerry launched a blistering attack on Russia Wednesday for its actions in Syria, pointing to the bombing of a UN aid convoy that left more than 20 dead and its inability to stop continued Syrian air attacks. Kerry spoke immediately after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York about the five-year Syrian war. ""I listened to my colleague from Russia and I sort of felt like we're in a parallel universe here,"" Kerry said of their differing accounts of the conflict. He called for all planes in key areas of Syria to be immediately grounded and for countries to stop supporting those who sabotage ceasefire efforts.  Kerry also questioned how the US-supported opposition can engage in political talks to resolve the conflict when the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, doesn't halt its attacks. Russia was tasked with restraining Syria during this latest attempt at a ceasefire, undertaken last week. RELATED: US blames Russia for Syria convoy attack; Moscow points to terrorists  ""How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and acts with impunity,"" Kerry asked. ""You're supposed to sit there and have happy talk in Geneva while the regime drops bombs?"" Russian denial The diplomatic clashing of swords highlights just how hard it has been to take even the first steps toward calming the Syrian conflict enough to begin political talks. The ongoing civil war has given terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda fertile recruiting ground, has sucked in regional powers seeking influence over the outcome and has sent ripples through Europe and its allies. As diplomats sparred at the Security Council, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said that Moscow was sending an aircraft cruiser to the Mediterranean to strengthen its capabilities there.   The Russians have denied that they were behind the attack on the UN convoy and instead have offered a series of explanations that Kerry detailed at the Security Council meeting.. Russia initially said that the strike was a necessary response to an alleged offensive by an al-Qaeda-linked terror group, Kerry said. Then Russia claimed they were bombing elsewhere, then that the aid convoy had been followed by militants with mortars, and then that the trucks caught fire. ""The trucks and the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted,"" Kerry said. ""Anybody here believe that?"" he asked. The bombing attacks on hospitals and children are ""flagrant violations of international law,"" he added. And attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers continue, Kerry noted. He cited separate air strikes on Monday that killed four aid workers near Aleppo. ""There are only two countries that have planes that are flying during the night or flying in that particular area at all,"" Kerry said. ""They are Russia and Syria.""   'Thorough and impartial' investigation At the Security Council Wednesday, Lavrov said Russia always put as a top priority the resumption of the inter-Syrian political dialogue without any preconditions. And he called for a ""thorough and impartial"" investigation into Monday's bombing, which left the convoy of trucks in a twisted wreck of smoking metal. And he urged his counterparts at the meeting to ""refrain from emotional comments."" US officials have fingered Russia as the perpetrator of the attack based on intelligence and reports from the ground. Kerry cited eyewitnesses who said that ""all of a sudden, the place became hell and the fighter jets were in the sky."" The White House said publicly Tuesday night that it held Russians responsible, regardless of whether it or the Syrian government had launched the strikes, since they have responsibility for the airspace. ""We have not seen good faith. This was an outrageous action,"" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. Syrian Ambassador to the UN Bashaar Jaafari hit back, saying it was ""laughable"" for Kerry to cite eyewitness accounts when, he claimed, ""thousands of people"" in the area hadn't seen any jets. He also took the US to task for an airstrike on Satruday that killed 62 Syrian soldiers, calling it a ""deliberate and unacceptable aggression."" The US has said it was an accident. Kerry's scathing 28-minute speech to the Security Council also pressed the need to return to a 2012 plan to create a political transition in Syria. He pointed to repeated Syrian attacks on civilians, detailed shifting Russian explanations about the aid convoy attack and ridiculed Moscow's argument that political talks shouldn't be burdened with preconditions. The US has said that Russia bears responsibility for the attack on the convoy because they were the only two countries flying planes over the area at that time and Russia had pledged to restrain Syria. ""The primary question is no longer what do we know,"" Kerry said. ""The primary question is, collectively, what are we going to do about it? In other words, this is a moment of truth."" Washington, Moscow clash Lavrov needled the US over opposition groups during his address. Washington and Moscow have clashed over Russian targeting of moderate Syrian opposition groups backed by the US. The Russians have claimed that some of these groups are not particularly moderate and have accused opposition groups of violating the ceasefire.  On Wednesday, Lavrov called for all members of the International Syrian Support Group to ensure that the opposition groups over which they have influence will comply with the cessation of hostilities. Otherwise, he added, ""We can't preserve Syria as a single, united state.""  And he alluded to ""geopolitical engineering,"" a reference to Russian concerns about US attempts at ""regime change."" Syria's Jaafari echoed the argument, telling the meeting that the International Syrian Support Group was ""formed outside international legitimacy"" and was ""reminiscent of other destructive coalitions that only brought disasters to countries like Iraq and Libya and Yemen."" The only success the US has managed to achieve, Jaafari said, is to level ""false accusations"" about the ""suffering of Syrians to demonize the Syrian government and its allies."" Four failed ceasefires Kerry had left the meeting before the Syrian ambassador spoke, but when Jaafari had finished speaking, Ambassador Michele Sison, the US deputy representative to the UN, asked to address the council. ""My colleagues are entitled to their own opinions but not to their own facts,"" Sison said. ""Let's just keep in mind just who is prolonging the suffering of the people of Syria."" Jaafari's remarks had been ""so full of untruths that I feel no need to say anything further,"" she said. For his part, earlier in the meeting, Kerry mocked Lavrov's argument that there should be no preconditions before political negotiations start. Citing four international-level agreements calling for a cessation of hostilities that could then lead to peace talks, Kerry said, ""that's not a precondition. That's an international agreement, four times arrived at."" RELATED: Obama at UN warns Americans against walls and nationalism ""Four times, it's been shredded by independent actors,"" Kerry said, ""by spoilers who don't want a cease-fire."" Half of Syria's population has been uprooted, many of them fleeing to Europe, and well over 300,000 men, women and children have been killed, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the meeting.   ""Those who believe the crisis in Syria cannot become even worse are dead wrong,"" Kerry said, ""as are those who believe there's a military solution.""

790,"As cities are burned in wake of yet another “peaceful protest” involving uninformed public that don’t wait for the facts, it should come as no surprise to anyone that when the facts are released, a different story resents itself altogether. Terence Crutcher was a black man shot by police earlier this week. Immediately the media portrayed it as “unarmed black man shot by racist white cop.” However, when more details came out, it’s clear that the media did its best to bury the story and glom onto the newest “victim” of the media’s outrage machine. Here’s the truth of what happened, and it’s every Black Lives Matter supporter’s worst nightmare. Not only did Crutcher not have his hands raised, but it appears that the officer’s account of him reaching in the car was justified, as well as the bombshell that PCP was found in his car, with the jury out on if it was in his system. If it was, that lends credence to the officer’s story, making him incredibly hard to subdue. According to Bearing Arms, Numerous media organizations that should know better, from Sky News, to Reuters, to NPR, are claiming that white Tulsa (OK) Police Department officer Betty Shelby shot and killed Terence Crutcher standing in the road with his hands up. That is a demonstrable lie, as proven with simple screen captures from video footage from the police helicopter circling overhead.  In the photo above, Crutcher, wearing a white shirt and tan pants, can be seen walking away from Officer Betty Shelby. His hands are clearly raised… at this precise moment.  Unfortunately for all concerned, Crutcher does not obey lawful commands to freeze, and walks back to his vehicle.  As shown above, Crutcher walks to the driver’s side door, and his right hand is still clearly raised. His left hand is still up as well, but blends into the dark color of the windows.  As Mr. Crutcher squares up with the driver’s side door of his vehicle straddling the centerline of the road, his hands are still raised. But they don’t stay there.  As the helicopter continues in a counterclockwise turn, Mr. Crutcher clearly drops his hands to his side.  As we can see above, Mr. Crutcher’s right hand has dropped and is just in front of his waist. His left hand still appears to be up and positioned near the upper door frame or “A” pillar.  At the moment just before Mr. Crutcher simultaneously shot once by Officer Shelby (right) and tased by Officer Tyler Turnbough (left), Mr. Crutcher’s hand is clearly down near his waist near the right front pants pocket area. This is when both officers decided to discharge respective weapons.  The image above is just after Mr. Crutcher was simultaneously shot once in the chest and tased.  In the image directly above, Mr. Crutcher has just been shot, and the wound to his chest is just starting to bleed. throught the hole. Mr. Crutcher will begin bleeding much more profusely within fractions of a second, then roughly 2 seconds later, he will collapse to the ground. Here’s the video. Watch it for yourself. * * * Without passing any judgments one way or the other on whether Mr. Crutcher’s actions warranted the shot fired by Officer Shelby, one thing is 100% clear, and that is that Terence Crutcher’s hands were not raise when he was shot, but down by his side. The mainstream media is, universally and without question, lying to you about the circumstances of Terence Crutcher’s shooting. Read more here… ",0,0,1
187,"Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire. The Republican nominee’s demon spawn appeared on on Friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the American dream. After trashing Hillary Clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, Eric Trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. And his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad’s life. “He’s built an amazing company. He’s become the epitome of the American dream.” Eric Trump said. “He’s gone from practically nothing to a man who’s just…” But that was a total lie and Julie Roginsky didn’t let the younger Trump get away with it. Roginsky cut Eric Trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father Fred Trump to start out with. Nothing?” Roginsky said. “He got a million bucks. Come on, Eric.” Indeed, Donald Trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in America. He has never known poverty in his entire life. In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a “small loan” moments after he claimed that life “hasn’t been easy for me” during a town hall event in October 2015. Of course, that’s an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily and can’t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. Trump’s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing. But Eric Trump didn’t address Roginsky’s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. “He epitomized what America’s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?” Eric Trump continued. “It’s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it’s very different than a person who has been a career politician.” Here’s the video via VidMe.  Can no member of Trump’s family actually refrain from lying about their past? Because it’s clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. They have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they’ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives. But for some reason, they think $1 million is the definition of starting with nothing. ",0,1,0
915,"The Washington Post’s intrepid reporter David Fahrenthold’s investigation into the Trump Foundation and the finances of Republican nominee Donald Trump have found yet another instance of foul play by the avaricious real estate mogul. It turns out that Trump has been using his tax-exempt charitable foundation as a vehicle for tax evasion by having companies that owe his money funnel it through the Foundation, allowing him to dodge the taxes on nearly $2.3 million in income.  For instance, the Trump Foundation received payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” Anonymous sources within the Trump organization indicate that the man, Richard Ebers, was instructed to pay Trump for goods and services to the Foundation instead. This helps explain why people kept on “donating” to the Trump Foundation after it became clear that not even the man it was named after cared enough to put any money into it – his last donation was in 2008. Senior Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn said that “what Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely ‘suggest’ that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.” Which is the exact definition of shady business dealing. The Head of the Internal Revenue Service’s non-profit watchdog agency, apparently extremely negligent in his monitoring of the Trump Foundation, was absolutely dumbfounded by what Fahrenthold’s investigation is uncovering. “This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total”  said Marc Owens. It is absolutely clear that Trump is violating the rules surrounding tax-exempt foundations, rules that were written to stop this exact kind of dishonest money laundering. The consequences of those violations bring monetary penalties, the loss of tax-exempt status, and possibly – if we’re lucky – criminal charges. Trump has claimed innocence when queried on the issue. “Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?”asked journalist Sharyl Attkisson. “Well, I hope so…I mean, my lawyers do it” shrugged the Republican nominee. The Trump Foundation has no paid staff, let alone lawyers, so draw your own conclusions from that. It is absolutely astonishing that the Trump campaign would have the nerve to go after the Clinton Foundation when his own “charity” is literally a money-laundering organization that is being used to perpetrate tax fraud, pay political bribes to unscrupulous Republican politicians investigating his other fraudulent businesses, and purchase $10,000 paintings of himself. The polar opposite of charitable, Donald Trump’s greedy schemes border on the comical in their pervasiveness and extension. Corruption is his modus operandi, and we cannot allow him to turn our nation into a giant kleptocracy.",0,1,0
864,"When Republicans decided to vote for a guy who promised skip pandering to oligarchs for money, little did they know their presidential nominee meant to hand control of America’s highest offices to those very billionaires directly. Word has leaked that Donald Trump plans to nominate oil executive Forrest Lucas as Interior Minister, breaking the long tradition of naming those from the rural Western states to lead the agency which manages America’s public parks, lands and wildlife. This would be disastrous for the fair enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, protecting the environment from the devastating effects of fracking, and animal rights in general, because Forrest Lucas is the sort of man who literally fights for the right to exploit animals in entertainment and is an avowed enemy of the Humane Society which provides low cost veterinary services, spaying and neutering to pet owners across the USA, as Politico writes: Lucas, who owns a ranch and serves on Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “anti-conservation zealots.” In a public hint of the rampant nepotism that Trump is planning to make official policy, they even said that the infamous cheetah killer, Trump’s self-entitled son Don Jr., is also in the running for Interior Secretary. The Interior Ministry quite literally owns 28% of America’s land, manages our national parks and forests, the federal Fish & Wildlife Service, and also makes major decisions in the gambling industry because of its oversight of the commission that regulates tribal casinos. The Department of Interior holds massive sway over mineral extraction rights and leasing on public lands too, so the oil industry relies on it for decisions, regulations and pays rent to Uncle Sam through that government agency too. The Sierra Club issued a stark warning about what Trump’s choice means for the country: “Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump’s promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he’s elected.” Lucas is the kind of heartless swine who fought (and thankfully failed) to stop a voter ballot initiative that targeted cruel puppy mills in Missouri in 2010. It’s scary to watch while Donald Trump dangles choices for a powerful appointed public office so outrageous it seems almost comical. If the only two choices are a reactionary oil company oligarch who will certainly plunder our nation’s natural bounty like a child in a candy shop and supports animal cruelty as a policy platform or the silver-spoon-fed self-entitled neo-Nazi misogynist scion who takes pleasure in slaughtering defenseless endangered animals with high-powered weapons, one might ask if this was a made-for-TV movie. But Donald Trump is very serious – as is the threat he poses to our country.  ",0,1,0
591,"There are severe penalties for lying in the courts and lying to Congress.  With this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven.  After witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught.  The problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods.  The issue I am talking about is in the field of government accounting. Now we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it.  But this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation.  Now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation.  Countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to Fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation.  Check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise.  And the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ). With so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control.  After all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a country’s government?  As I spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents.  This sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue.  This is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval. Fro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the government’s attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates I refer you to an article written by Jim Puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html .  What motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting  the country?  It is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer.  They think they can get away with it.  And they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting.  In today’s world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country. The irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. What they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival.  This is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality.  This in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals.  But what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house? This issue is not covered on the financial channels on TV to any extent.  It is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday Americans watching prices go through the roof.  When the issue is brought up, Americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern.  As Ronald Reagan said, “ Trust but verify”.  There is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true.  The real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populace’s throat.  The adjustments to Social Security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesn’t want to face up to  and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena. Now that the American public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the “core index” that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the American public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country.  There is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they haven’t.  If you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised.  The emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him. Not only is the government deceiving and manipulating the American public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation.  There has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the U.N. and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred.  The clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by Plato’s Utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment. As with the Soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. Faking reality doesn’t change reality , it only destroys the dishonest.  Facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if we’ll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet.  The terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion.  We are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in Pennsylvania we need to “Roll” or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good.

216,"For weeks, Donald Trump and his henchmen have tried to paint a picture of Hillary Clinton that suggests she’s physically and mentally unfit to be the next president. Whenever Clinton coughed, they would claim she had one foot in the grave. When she fainted on 9/11, Trump and his people were pounced with glee. Then we discover she tried to tough it out with walking pneumonia, and suddenly they turned that into an attack on her honesty. So going into the presidential debates, everyone was waiting for Trump to unleash some sort of attack on Clinton’s health. And once it started to become apparent that he was losing the debate, the billionaire did just that. When addressing the issue of race in America, Trump said: “You look at the inner cities, and I just left Detriot, and I just left Philidelphia. And I just…You know. You’ve seen me I’ve been all over the place. Uh, You decided to stay home and I mean that’s okay…But I will tell you. I’ve been all over and I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ll ever meet within these communities. And they are very very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.” Clinton’s response was perfect. “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for?” There was a slight pause before she continued: “I prepared to be president and I think that’s a good thing.” Image via Giphy The expression on Trump’s face following Clinton’s comeback was priceless. See for yourself.  Some critics pointed out that Clinton’s “gotcha line” came off as rehearsed. But isn’t that sort of the point she was making? The point is that Clinton did rehearse, she studied, and prepared, not just for one debate, but also for an important job that entails far more significant consequences for bad decisions than low TV ratings and lawsuits. America saw just who the real adult was in this contest and at the end of the day that’s the person you hire to do the most important job in the world. Featured image via YouTube.

513,"Washington (CNN)The Donald Trump-Rosie O'Donnell feud is back in the 2016 spotlight.

Declaring her support for Clinton, O'Donnell tweeted, ""HE WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT"" and then later called on people to ""shame the Donald."" Trump's comments on O'Donnell came after Clinton accused Trump of sexism during the debate, saying, ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs."" ""Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it I said in entertainment, some of it said to somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell,"" Trump responded. ""I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.""

Trump slammed the ad as ""inappropriate"" and accused Clinton of misrepresenting his views. ""It's inappropriate. It's not nice, but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me — many of which are absolutely untrue,"" Trump continued. ""They're untrue and they're misrepresentations and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice and I don't deserve that.""

740,"In the wake of the recent rioting and looting in NC, officers at one Charlotte police station were in for a heck of a shock when a little black boy came stumbling into the station totally unannounced. Even before the child had a chance to speak a word, one officer quickly called over her fellow officers in the station and rushed towards the boy. The horrifying episode for this young boy all started when he was woken up by sirens and helicopters from outside during the riots on Tuesday. The riots were happening just outside the boy's window, but naturally he was completely unaware of why any of this was happening, or even what was really happening. The next day, on the way to school, the boy's mother, Deanna Hooker was playing the radio and the two heard a news report about how several officers were injured in the rioting and attacks. Deanna had no idea how much the riots and news of the injured officers had really affected her son. After seeing so much hate in the news in and his surrounding community Deanna was rather surprised to hear her son's idea. The boy thought about the riots for days and the impact that they had on him and continued to have on him. He wanted to make an impact himself for those who risk their lives to keep him safe. ""He asked me if he could bring the police donuts and give them hugs for all they do,"" Deanna's Facebook post read that was later shared by Love What Matters.  With a little help from his mom he was able to carry out this very kind and meaningful gesture. He wore a sign around his neck that read, ""Free hugs,"" and carried in a big donut box. Deanna's son walked into the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and gave the officers his two gifts. He didn't just tell one officer about how he felt, he made sure to go around to every single officer to tell them how he felt about the service they do for him and his mother. ""It is amazing how much children can teach us during times like this,"" Deanna's post said about her amazing son.

1151,"NEW YORK — The United States and Russia ended any pretenses Thursday of their cease-fire for Syria remaining in force after days of increased violence and the Syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in Aleppo. ""We can't go out to the world and say we have an agreement when we don't,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said after meeting the top diplomats from Russia and more than a dozen European and Middle Eastern countries. Story Continued Below Kerry's statement, after three days of private and public diplomacy on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, provided an ominous endnote to a week diplomats had hoped would be a major capstone toward peace. Instead, Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who negotiated the truce two weeks ago, went their separate ways as violence in Syria flared anew and the relationship between the two key foreign powers in the conflict appeared to reach a new low. No one spoke of being able to quickly resuscitate the cease-fire. While Kerry and Lavrov were set to hold more talks Friday, even confidence-building measures seem beyond their reach at this point. As the diplomats huddled in a New York hotel, Syria's military command said it would restart operations in the northern city of Aleppo, scene of some of the most bitter fighting in recent months. According to one official present in the gathering, Kerry was informed of the news when his chief of staff showed him a headline on his BlackBerry. A furious Kerry then told the entire room, Lavrov included, that ""even while we are meeting here, they are doing this,"" said the official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. Lavrov told Russian media that consultations would continue to ""guarantee"" the cease-fire. But even as Kerry vowed to press on with all efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war between Syrian President Bashar Assad's Russian-backed government and U.S.-backed rebels, he acknowledged the current strategy wasn't working. ""We can't be the only ones trying to hold this door open,"" Kerry told reporters. ""Russia and the regime must do their part or this will have no chance."" He called for the immediate grounding of planes and helicopters that have launched airstrikes, including a Russian one earlier this week that the U.S. says hit an aid convoy, killing 20 civilians. Russia has denied responsibility, while raising a range of ulterior scenarios for how the caravan might have been struck. ""Absent a major gesture like this, we don't believe there is a point to making more promises or issuing more plans or announcing something that can't be reached,"" Kerry said, describing a ""moment of truth"" for Syria, Russia and all those trying to halt the bloodshed. The meeting came after Assad told the AP in an interview in Damascus that the United States was to blame for the deal's failure. He cited U.S. inability to control ""terrorist"" groups and a weekend attack that killed dozens of Syrian soldiers. The U.S. apologized for what it described as a mistake. Lavrov had sought a three-day pause in fighting to revive the cease-fire. But U.S. officials said there was no point returning to a situation in which rebels would be pressed to hold fire, while the Syrian and Russian military's could violate the agreement.",1,0,0
119,"A reporter for VICE News was arrested this weekend trying to get his press pass from the Trump campaign. Donald Trump attacked New York Times writer Maureen Dowd on Twitter for a negative story â Â a routine practice for the Republican presidential nominee. Heâs blacklisted reporters throughout the election and treated them so badly theyâve had to be escorted out of his rallies by Secret Service officers. He says he wants to âopen upâ libel laws, which would weaken journalistsâ ability to report hard-hitting stories. He sued websites for writing that his wife and theÂ potential first lady was rumored to be a Slovenian hooker. And Monday, Trump made a comment about the press that is arguably one of his worst yet. In an interview with âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News, Trump was speaking about the latest terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey that occurred over the weekend. After blaming refugees, despite there being absolutely no evidence the refugee program is to blame, the hosts mentioned that people donât need to be radicalized in Syria or IraqÂ becauseÂ they can simply go online to be indoctrinated by terrorist groups. Trump turned his sites on a constitutionally protected right, the freedom of press and expression: âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw.â Trump then said he was totally in favor of freedom of the press, then turned right around and shat on freedom of the press saying they are âinciting violence.â âThey tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. Instead, they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.â â And Trump also alluded to the fact that information on the internet should not be freely available (kind of like China): âThe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. Theyâre inciting violence, okay? Theyâre making violence possible. They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Incitement is not a constitutionally protected right, but itâs hard to prove that by making information available a website owner or writer is intentionally inciting a specific crime. But if the bar is lowered, Trump himself could be arrested for incitement, after telling his supporters to take out protesters at his rallies, or his comment that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could stop Clinton. Trumpâs problem with the media is troubling. Using these latest attacks to go after constitutionally protected freedomsÂ reeks of Bush-era fear-mongering that led to the U.S. giving up privacy rights to the government. Trump has left a long trail of breadcrumbs showing us heâs on a path to destroy the First Amendment as we know it. Freedom of expression and press is considered to be the fourth pillar of democracy in this country, without those freedoms the press is just a propaganda machine for the person in power. Only a small man fears information. Featured Image via Getty Images/Gustavo Caballero",0,1,0

352,"Washington (CNN)Boxing promoter Don King thrust himself back into the political scene Wednesday when he dropped the N-word at a Donald Trump minority outreach event. It's the latest step into the political fray for King, who has a long history of colorfully weighing in on politics on both sides of the aisle going back half a century. After serving nearly four years in prison for a manslaughter conviction in 1966 for killing an associate who owed him $600, King was later pardoned of the crime in 1983 by then-Ohio Gov. Jim Rhodes. The governor received letters of recommendation from several luminaries, including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, a Democrat, and then-Cleveland mayor (and future Ohio senator) George Voinovich, a Republican. In 1992, King invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions before a Senate subcommittee investigating ties between boxing and organized crime. Here are a few other political highlights from King's career: 'Republicrat' At the June funeral for Muhammad Ali, with whom King at one point worked, he declared his non-partisan status. ""I'm endorsing the people. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, I'm a Republicrat, and I go with the will of the people,"" he told the New York Daily News. Hillary Clinton King previously praised Trump's Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, calling her ""dynamic"" at a 2014 fundraiser for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a major Trump critic. ""I have been a supporter of Secretary Clinton for a long time,"" King said at the event, which benefited the Nevada senator's re-election campaign. ""She is a dynamic woman, and I am a fighter for woman's rights,"" he added. Barack Obama The Cleveland native supported President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. At the time, he said white voters struggling to get behind a black candidate need to move past it. King said they should ""ask God to help you pretend that Barack Obama is white,"" he told journalists. ""I understand very well that after more than three centuries of being taught, conditioned and indoctrinated to hate the black man as your inferior, it is unrealistic to think that now you can just change to respect him,"" he wrote. ""Try to think of your beloved country America and what's best for Miss Liberty,"" King added. ""Then try not to think of Barack Obama as a black man but as an American fighting for what's best for your children and your country."" Reince Priebus King, The New York Times reported, was supposed to address this summer's Republican National Convention, but several Republican National Committee officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, nixed the idea, citing the promoter's legal problems. King later said the party chairman removed him because he doesn't ""like black people."" ""I'm not speaking because Reince Priebus is still thinking he don't like black people,"" King told reporters in July. ""I have less than a damn about what Reince Priebus thinks, especially when he's so antiquated."" Black Lives Matter King spoke on the tensions between black residents and law enforcement, saying the ""root"" of the problem gets lost in social media. ""You can't use short-term slogans because people don't understand and they twist them around,"" he said on the floor of the Republican National Convention. ""In our hashtag culture, we treat the effects, not the cause. You've got to get to the cause."" Female voters ""You got to understand what I'm trying to say to you is that the white woman -- and I put it in this kind of (words) so you understand what I'm saying -- the white woman and the slave, the people of color,"" King said Wednesday while campaigning for Trump. ""When the system was created, they did not get heard. The first will be last and the last will be first."" ""The white woman did not have the rights, and she still don't have the rights,"" he added. ""And people of color don't have their rights -- those are the 'left outs.'"" ""Donald Trump says no -- we (are) going back to inclusiveness,"" King added. ""Everybody counts."" On which political party is best for black voters ""Martin Luther King says that both the Republican and the Democrat have a long history of using the black vote as a political football: Promise us everything, give us nothing,"" he told New York Magazine in 2004. George W. Bush ""Oooh! I get a passion. I'm getting excited right now when you said that. George Walker Bush -- he's tough-minded but he's tender-hearted. He's trying to reclaim that glory of that American Dream for all Americans. He put African-Americans in top policy positions higher than any president. He took two people, black, and put them in charge of 300 million people for their security,"" he told New York Magazine. On Bush and terrorism ""George Bush utilizes the big stick. Whatever means necessary. If he wasn't in that White House when we had that despicable attack of terrorism in New York, I shudder to think, I tremble at what would be happening. We would probably have to be doing this interview on the underground, secretly, for fear if we'd go to the street, the treachery that abounds would take alight,"" he said in New York Magazine.

185,"What you are about to see is disturbing. Keith Lamont Scott, the man killed by police in Charlotte, North Carolina had an awesome wife of 20 years who narrated and recorded the final tragic moments of his life. Mr. Scott suffered from a traumatic brain injury, and his wife repeatedly told the police this information in the minutes prior to the shooting. She also told them that he had no weapon, and that he had just taken his medication. Of course, the cops just kept shouting at the man to drop the gun that he didn’t have, before taking his life for no reason. Well, the cat’s out of the bag now. NBC News has the video, so, despite the fact that the cops and the City of Charlotte have been refusing to take the public’s demands for transparency seriously, the information is now out there thanks to the bravery of Mrs. Scott. Here is the news report, via NBC:  These cops have a whole hell of a lot of explaining to do on this one. They better release whatever information they have, and they better not try any funny business with cover-ups. This is a damning, disturbing, and heartbreaking video of yet another senseless death of a black man in America at the hands of the system that is supposed to serve and protect. At this point, there is just absolutely no reason to trust the police, period. They are clearly killing people with impunity and without consequence.

437,"Washington, D.C. (CNN)The Pentagon is considering a proposal that could send an additional 500 troops to Iraq to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces take Mosul from ISIS in the coming weeks, a US defense official told CNN. The possibility of sending some number of additional forces has been reported for several weeks, including by CNN. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the proposal centered around the possibility of up to 500 additional forces. No final decision has been made, the official said. If the proposal is approved, it is anticipated that would be the final wave of additional US forces for fighting ISIS, since Mosul remains the last major ISIS stronghold in Iraq, the official added. If the proposal is okayed, it will raise the ceiling on the number of US troops in Iraq from 4,647 to over 5,000. Several hundred additional troops move in and out of Iraq on temporary deployment orders. Currently, there are 4,470 there under the approved ceiling. The Pentagon is not precisely revealing what the troops might be called upon to do. Some number are expected to be military advisors and trainers for Iraqi and Kurdish forces, whiles others could be involved in logistics such as moving supplies and troops around the battlefield, the official said. Arizona Republican John McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, criticized the move Thursday. ""Indeed, we read this morning of plans for yet another incremental increase of 500 troops in Iraq, one more step down the road of gradual escalation,"" he said. ",1,0,0

Arina Koltsova, 35, was arresting a man on New Year’s Day when the suspect spat in her face, the Daily Mail reported. She didn’t know the man had tuberculosis at the time. Koltsova went untreated for some time until she collapsed at work one day. She was then diagnosed with tuberculosis and started treatment.  “She became ill after New Year's Day,” Her on-duty partner, Officer Mikhail Kindrakevich, told the Daily Mail. “She had arrested this guy and he spat in her face. Some time later she collapsed. She had received treatment. She underwent chemotherapy, she was fed food through an IV drip and she had lost a lot of weight”  Koltsova died on July 25. She was buried in Kiev two days later. “This is an irreplaceable loss for the whole of Kiev police, fond memories of Arina will remain in our hearts forever,” Koltsova’s police department wrote on its social media page.  “Arina wanted to change something for our country,” wrote one of her friends. “Joining the police was a conscious choice, she wanted to change things for better.”  According to the National Institutes of Health, tuberculosis can be treated by taking antibiotics six to 12 months. Some cases can be drug-resistant and are not easily treated. It is unclear if Koltsova had a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis or if she was not diagnosed quickly enough for effective treatment. It is unclear if the suspect will be charged in Koltsova’s death.  Sources: Daily Mail, Inquistr, NIH / Photo credit: Arina Koltsova via CEN",0,0,1
706,"Three significant events occurred on Capitol Hill this week. John Stumpf, CEO of Wells Fargo, was grilled by the Senate Banking Committee over unethical and potentially illegal account management practices at his bank. John Koiskinen, head of the IRS, appeared before a House impeachment hearing to answer for destruction of evidence and obstruction charges from House Republicans. We also saw Heather Bresch, Mylan CEO, appear before another House committee in response to an investigation into the flurry of Epipen price gouging accusations. In each case, the common response from the senior person in charge was, “I take full responsibility for . . .”, followed by a delineation of the problems, excuses and diversionary issues that are obvious to anyone looking at their particular quandary. Yes, CEO Stumpf was RESPONSIBLE for the actions of Wells Fargo bankers who opened 2 million fake accounts. He was, in fact, the CEO, and those individuals all reported up through his AOR (area of responsibility). Yes, Director Koiskinen did head up and was RESPONSIBLE for the IRS during a time when Cogress was reviewing the practice of delaying conservative non-profit tax determinations and destruction of evidence under subpoena in the IRS. The individuals who trashed hard drives, delayed FOIA requests and pled the 5th in response to sincere congressional inquiries did, in fact, report up to him. Yes, Ms. Bresch is RESPONSIBLE for the entirety of pricing decisions and financial results at Mylan as its CEO. Whoever determined that the Epipen should be repriced up to $800 from $300, when Mylan holds the sole injection delivery patent and can produce the only generic option, did, in fact, work in the organization for which CEO Bresch was responsible. What was largely ignored in each of their congressional inquiries is the difference between RESPONSIBILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY. One can be responsible for overseeing the actions of those who report to them, but being accountable is a completely separate issue. For too long, and in too many positions of leadership, particularly in the public, non-market sector, the person in charge who was ‘responsible’ has not been held accountable. It’s well documented how difficult it is to fire a federal employee, despite how many hours they spent watching porn in their cubicle, or how many VA appointment records they falsified. The private sector and it’s free-market mechanisms are more effective at isolating accountability to individuals. However, it is is equally well-documented that a corporate firing normally comes attached with a public statement of ‘early retirement’ and a comfortable golden parachute to soften the landing for the exited executive. Rarely, are corporate and public leaders truly held accountable for the actions and results over which they are responsible. As Senator Warren delivered her strong and rightful rebuke of Stumpf, it should be noted that she could similarly be asked, “where are my promised $2500 savings from Obamacare?, “why did I have to give up my doctor on passage of the AACA?”, “how do you explain the $20 trillion in national debt my as yet unborn grandchildren now own?”, “why is the VA still mistreating our veterans?”, etc. It’s easy to be ‘responsible’ for something . . . once elected or landed in position, to sit in a corner office and collect a nice paycheck and guaranteed pension, while telling someone else what to do, all the while hiding behind bureaucracy, complicated regulations and processes, human resources and legal staffs, and corporate and government committees. It’s far different to be ‘accountable’, and made to personally and individually own the results of the actions which occurred on one’s watch or direction. One might define bureaucracy as the textbook example of ‘responsibility with accountability.” If so, then the reverse would be ‘accountability without responsibility”, which many would say is what happened to the fired bankers at Wells Fargo. Some would also describe that as terrifying. America at its best functioned under the idea of individual responsibility – hard work, gaining an education, making wise choices, providing for oneself and family, pursuing the American Dream, and being a productive member of your community and society. Under individual responsibility, one has to own the results of their actions, accept accountability – consequences – for their shortfalls and mistakes, and then decide how to move forward. A running back, given responsibility to hold onto the football, who has a fumbling problem will find himself experiencing the consequence (accountability) of getting to sit on the bench. A bank robber who takes the responsibility of relieving the local branch of their cash will normally be held accountable for their actions in a Federal penitentiary. As the ideas of collective responsibility, corporatism and crony capitalism have taken root – closely tied to the expanding power of the public sector, in government, academia and the closely-aligned media, and the growing interconnectedness of private and public enterprise – individuals are absolved of the consequences of their individual actions and can hide behind the system, the process, the complexities, the nuanced views, and the collective weight of administrative machinery that grinds down any effort to reward or place accountability on the individual. The private sector retains many aspects of individual responsibility, as we saw this week in the willingness of Mr. Stumpf and Ms. Bresch to appear before the inevitably-hostile congressional panels. They made gallant efforts to defend their respective corporate positions, knowing they would have a board of directors to report back to, and legal departments anxious to avoid class-action suits based on their CEO’s public comments. In each case, though, neither Stumpf, Koiskinen or Bresch understood the notion of accountability. Saying ‘I’m sorry this happened’ isn’t enough. Saying ‘we’ll make it right’ doesn’t cut it. Promising that ‘we’ll do better next time’ is a hollow statement. Yes, they should each be sorry and filled with personal sorrow. Let’s hope they are sincere in the promising of refunding fees and repairing the shattered credit of thousands. Let’s even assume they’ll fix the 501c3 application process, quit destroying records under subpoena, and make the price of life-saving Epipens affordable to every Family. Those are all actions for which they are responsible, they control the budgets, organizations, plans and activities of their enterprises,and as the senior leaders, they can personally make those actions happen. There’s still the matter of accountability . . . consequences. Mr. Stumpf, careers were ruined and lives were thrown into turmoil by the actions of Wells Fargo, for which you were responsible and, not coincidentally, you and many others profited enormously. Mr. Koiskinen, you allowed the IRS to subvert the will of the people to oversee and correct the oppressive actions of the government’s most-feared agency, while retaining your position, power and pension. Ms. Bresch, under your watch and your authority, Mylan took advantage of countless families with no other options, earning millions for your company and yourself. You were all responsible. Now, how will you be held accountable? That remains to be seen. Even among our most revered and senior leaders, responsibility is rarely joined with accountability. Hillary ‘took responsibility’ for the Benghazi disaster and deaths of four Americans, her home-brew email server spewing classified secrets, and forgetting scores of classified briefings. Now she’s running for President. Four brave Americans were accountable and took on the consequence for our potential future president’s actions or indecision. Spare us for thinking that personal accountability is a rare concept in 21st Century America. ",0,0,1
1113,"It’s seven weeks before Election Day, five days before the highly anticipated first debate, and Donald Trump’s television advertisements have all but vanished. Trump’s ads last ran nearly a week ago in four battleground states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since then, the GOP presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to Hillary Clinton — and is only poised to launch a limited, less-targeted ad campaign in the days before next week’s debate. Story Continued Below While his campaign announced a new ad on Tuesday, it’s only going to run on national cable news stations and during two Sunday morning public-affairs shows, according to data from The Tracking Firm, a company that monitors media buys. And even with that seemingly modest buy — the full extent of which wasn't clear on Wednesday night — Clinton is still outspending him this week many times over. “It’s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again, off-again TV buy,” said Elizabeth Wilner, a former TV-network political director who, until last month, monitored political advertising for Kantar Media/CMAG. The strategy has perplexed political media buyers who aren’t affiliated with the campaign. Trump’s campaign is underfunded compared to Hillary Clinton’s — his campaign had only $50 million on hand as of Aug. 30, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission Tuesday night — but Trump’s failure to advertise consistently threatens the efficacy of his entire paid media campaign, limited as it is. The political media buyers, including Republicans who declined to be named in criticizing the nominee, warned that the effects of television ads are fleeting, and any benefit Trump might get from putting his paid advertisements in front of voters can be undone with time if those messages aren’t reinforced. The GOP nominee’s absence is also compounding Clinton’s domination of the airwaves. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, wrote in a memo to the Trump campaign that through Sept. 12, Trump had spent just $17 million on TV ads, compared to $126 million for Clinton. If outside group spending is counted, the disparity is even more stunning: $244 million for Clinton versus $33 million for Trump. The highly unusual decision to go mostly dark in advance of the debate is emblematic of Trump’s approach to television advertising in the general election, a patchwork effort that has engaged in swing states only in fits and starts. Of the 20 days thus far in September, Trump has advertised in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania for 11 days, and for 12 in Ohio. He’s also run one-week flights in a number of other states beginning over Labor Day weekend, only to let those expire more than a week ago and decline to rebook. A Trump campaign spokesman declined to reply to inquiries on Tuesday and Wednesday about the campaign’s strategy. Clinton, meanwhile, is continuing to blanket eight states in ads. Confusion about Trump’s strategy runs beyond the scale of his advertising — it’s the unpredictable nature of where and when he is advertising. When Trump first launched his TV ads in mid-August, they were focused on four core states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Together, those states will award 82 electoral votes — and Trump will win the election if he carries those four and holds all the other states Mitt Romney won in 2012. Trump went on the air in those states on August 19, and he kept advertising in them through September 6 or 7, depending on the state. While those ads were on the air, Trump expanded to six new states: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia. Ads began in those states in early September and ran for roughly one week – including an eye-popping, $2.2-million buy in Virginia, where the Clinton campaign stopped advertising last month after pulling comfortably ahead in the polls. But the Trump ads ended between September 7 and September 10, depending on the state. Trump has been off the air in those places ever since. Meanwhile, he reengaged in his four core states — Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania — on September 12. (Both campaigns abstained from airing ads on the 15th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.) After nearly a week off the air in those four states most central to his candidacy, Trump last Monday rolled out a combined $2.5-million ad buy over five days. But those reservations ended last Friday. In their place, Trump’s campaign is planning a limited ad campaign, buying time on four cable stations: Fox Business Network, Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNBC. He’s also planning to run national ads during at least two of the national Sunday morning public affairs programs on broadcast TV: “Fox News Sunday” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” For political purposes, it’s a relatively inefficient buy. The 11 states that make up POLITICO's Battleground States project hold roughly 29 percent of the population. That means, roughly speaking, that seven-in-10 Americans reached by a national ad buy live outside the battleground states. The Clinton campaign, on the other hand, continues to advertise heavily in eight targeted states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also, at times, running national advertisements. (The campaign’s investments in Arizona, which has voted Republican in 15 of the last 16 presidential elections, are much smaller than in the other states.) Just this week — from Tuesday through next Monday, the day of the first debate — Clinton is poised to spend nearly $6.8 million on TV ads, backed up by another $5.6 million from pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action in those states, minus Arizona. Trump’s air cover from outside groups is also far more limited than Clinton’s. Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump super PAC, is spending $635,000 in Pennsylvania this week. And an anti-Clinton super PAC based in Wisconsin, Reform America Fund, is spending $332,000 in that state, where neither campaign has advertised thus far. There are some signs Trump’s campaign may be focusing on its seemingly haphazard ad efforts. GOP ad-maker Rex Elsass met with Trump campaign officials last week, POLITICO reported on Tuesday. The campaign has already reserved about $2.8 million in satellite TV ads slated to air beginning on Tuesday, Sept. 27, through the day before Election Day in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. For Trump, there’s risk in continuing to delay: Booking ads at the last minute, as Trump’s campaign has been doing, sometimes means spending more money for the same spot as a campaign that makes its reservations earlier. And there are some signs that some of the late decision-making is driven by the candidate: The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump himself has been selecting the media markets in which the campaign has been advertising. Since research suggests the effects of television ads are short-lived — and with the race tightening in the battleground states in recent weeks, Trump can ill-afford to regress. “It has to be consistent,” said one GOP ad-buyer, “because the recall on these just evaporates when you go dark.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",1,0,0

Trump later said it was a joke. On Tuesday, Pence told CNN it was “a humorous tweet” and sought to turn the argument on the Democrats. “What Donald Trump said was a hoax is that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., can control the climate of the earth,” Pence said. “And the reality is that this climate change agenda that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to continue to expand is killing jobs in this country.” Pence has repeatedly pledged that he and Trump will end the so-called “war on coal,” a reference to Obama administration policies that have led to the closures of a number of coal-fired power plants.",1,0,0
1200,"Its prospects are far from clear, but talk about the impeachment of Gov. Chris Christie is no longer relegated to whispers between insiders. The prosecution’s opening argument in the Bridgegate case — which featured the claim that Christie was told of the George Washington Bridge lane closures as they happened by two high ranking Port Authority of New York and New Jersey appointees — brought the talk into the open. Story Continued Below Now Democratic lawmakers who control the Assembly and state Senate are watching the trial carefully to see if any more revelations could warrant the attempted removal of the governor from office. “All we know are the coming attractions that were given to us by each of the attorneys during their opening statements. They’ve all told us there will be proof at the trial that he governor knew about this,” said Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who helped break the controversy open as the leader of a committee investigating the Fort Lee bridge access lane closures that tied up traffic for days. “We don’t know exactly what that proof is,” Wisniewski said. “For instance, is it merely the photograph of the three of them talking before 9/11? That’s something we’ve already known about and in my opinion it’s hard to make a strong case for the photo alone that the governor knew.” A Democratic assemblyman who refused to discuss impeachment publicly confirmed a Friday morning NBC New York report that legislative staffers have begun researching the impeachment process. No governor in the state has been impeached before. The process would have to start in the Assembly. Earlier this week, the liberal group NJ Working Families called for Christie’s impeachment. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, who would make the call to begin the proceedings, said through a spokesman he “won't be commenting on the trial until it's completed and all evidence has been presented.” Still, even if the Assembly votes by a simple majority to initiate impeachment, it would then have to be tried in the Senate. Removing Christie from office would require a two-thirds majority there, which Democrats don’t have on their own. That could be complicated by the fact that Senate President Stephen Sweeney, under the state constitution, would not be allowed to participate in the trial — a vestige of New Jersey’s pre-lieutenant governor system when the Senate president was next in line for the governorship. Montclair State political science professor Brigid Harrison, who recently penned an op-ed that upped the intensity of impeachment talk, said that her interpretation of the constitution is that the Senate president would still be able to vote, though it might require some legal interpretation. The constitution states that the Senate trial would be presided over by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court and that “the President of the Senate shall not participate in the trial.” If Sweeney could not vote and the remaining 23 Senate Democrats were in lock step in favor of impeachment, at least four Republicans would have to join them to successfully remove Christie from office. Barring damning new evidence, it’s hard to see Senate Republicans going that way. The governor has had tremendous sway over the votes of GOP lawmakers. Only once have enough Senate Republicans joined Democrats to vote to override Christie’s veto of a piece of legislation, despite dozens of attempts. State Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr. did not return a call seeking comment. It's also far from certain that Senate Democrats would vote in lock step to remove Christie from office. South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, a close ally of Gov. Chris Christie, is the political benefactor for several of them, including Sweeney. Other Democratic senators have been staunch Christie allies, and one, Sandra Cunningham, is a personal friend. And Christie is close with Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo, whose deputy chief of staff is Democratic state Sen. Teresa Ruiz. Democrats would also be creating a political obstacle for themselves through impeachment. Christie’s popularity is mired at 26 percent, making him one of the least popular governors in the nation. He’s so disliked in New Jersey that Democrats are considered near shoo-ins to win the governorship in 2017. Handing the governor’s office to Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who is already laying the groundwork for a run in 2017, would not only give her the power of incumbency, but a potential easy way to make a fresh start while distancing herself from Christie. “It’s easier to run against Christie’s legacy than it would be to run against Guadagno,” Harrison said. Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray said Wisniewski, who's considering a run for governor, may benefit from impeachment. But it's far from certain other hopefuls, like Sweeney, would welcome it. ""There’s too many gubernatorial wannabees that don’t want to deal with an impeachment and, two, an incumbent Kim Guadgano as their opponent,"" Murray said. “The politics of it — there are too many people who have more to lose from that spectacle for a variety of reasons.""",1,0,0
454,"Washington (CNN)Most white working-class voters who are evangelical Christians -- like most white evangelicals -- would consider voting for Donald Trump. But it's not because they believe he shares their conservative Christian values. Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll. While black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four -- 76% -- say they'd consider voting for Trump. Partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans. The majority -- 6 in 10 -- of voters in this group believe the US' better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today. While most Christian groups -- 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics -- share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack. Trump often says he wants to ""make America great again,"" and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn't mean they don't question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness. ""When listening to him, he's not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have,"" said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company. ""I don't know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him,"" said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. ""That's the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn't like him."" Christian values seen as under attack That dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it's clear who is at fault for many of the country's issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class. ""I don't think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration,"" said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. ""Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like. Just a lot of things are said and done. It scares me."" Long, a Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative Christian values. ""I feel the country was founded on Christian principles. They came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs,"" she said. ""And now, if our ministers don't marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail."" While same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples. Darrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn't see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates. ""I don't see my values shaping the election. There's just a lot of mayhem,"" he said. ""I think the values that were in the country's founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily."" Many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory. ""I don't know where I am,"" said Long. ""I'm so confused at this point and time. I don't believe either one of them should be in office. I don't believe either one should be running."" Some have entertained third-party candidates. ""I'm sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can't stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I'm thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting,"" Mitchell said. For these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years. ""If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we'd be in jail,"" Mitchell said. ""But because she's the Democratic nominee, they don't hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people."" Many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith. Security also a concern But values aren't the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military. ""All these refugees they want to bring in, that's really got me going,"" said Pool, who participated in the survey. ""They have no idea who they're bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here."" ""I just think it's ludicrous and all it's for is so one party can have more voters,"" he said. The relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump's proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn't mean some among their flock aren't anxious. The majority -- 75% -- of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites. ""I say let's quit bringing these people in, period,"" Pool said. ""I realize America is a melting pot and that's how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can't come to this country. Come on in. Let's do it the right way."" ",1,0,0

910,"Donald Trump’s efforts to attract any kind of support from the African-American community has not gone well. After blatantly whitewashing four hundred years of oppression and enslavement by telling American blacks that they’ve “never had it worse” and then telling his supporters that the police brutality protests in Charlotte were due to “drugs,” Trump’s campaign tried to visit a civil rights museum in North Carolina to for a cheap photo-op – but couldn’t even muster the effort to pretend to be sincere about it, and he was resoundingly denied: “We did not honor the request of the Donald Trump team because we thought they demonstrated, in their approach was disrespectful” said the co-founder of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, Earl Jones.  “The approach, the type of disrespect, pretty much a demand and bullying us to use the museum in their manner and their way in their time,  it was inappropriate and I think it’s probably reflective of the type of insensitivity of civil rights and human rights that’s reflective from Trump over the years.” Jones complained that Trump’s staff was “aggressive” and “rude,” and that Trump’s camp apparently demanded that they close the museum for five hours to accommodate him. “We have equal treatment for everyone coming to the museum and we welcome everyone to the museum but we are not going to allow the museum to be used for political gain.” While it’s not a surprise to learn that the members of the Trump campaign are rude, pretentious scumbags, it’s truly illuminating just how deep racism and self-entitlement runs through every level of the “Trump Train.” We applaud Mr. Jones and jeer at Trump’s people for being entirely incapable of pretending to care about the African-American community. His insistence that blacks have “never had it worse” implies that they had it better under slavery and Jim Crow, which is a white supremacist line of thought to the core. How any black American could support Trump is beyond comprehension.",0,1,0
1583,"Holy cow, I started crying when I read this post. Mark Ross had just found out that his sister had been killed in a car accident by some dumb punk. His number 1 priority was to get to his mom to comfort her a couple states away. He had a friend drive him even though his friend had a suspended license. In Ohio, they were pulled over for a traffic violation and Ross was thinking, “We’re going to jail,” because his friend was driving illegally and he had a warrant out for his arrest.   The State Trooper had the car towed so they were stranded. Ross, breaking into tears explained to the other police officer who showed up, Sgt. David Robison, that his sister was just killed and he was trying to get to his mom to comfort her. Instead of arresting him, Sgt. Robison offered to drive him 100 miles (as far as he could go) to drop him closer to family. Just as Robison was dropping him off, he asked if he could pray for him. Ross’ Facebook post explains the moment, “He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY.” Ross then goes on to explain to his friends that, “Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops, but I am truly Grateful for this Guy. He gave me hope.” The one thing you can get from this story is that ALL Lives Matter and true humanity doesn’t see color. This cop helped a young man who was in pain because THAT is humanity and THAT is what police officers do. They are not trained to do it, it is in their blood. Most people join the police force because they want to help people. I am grateful for this Christian man who helped a young man gain hope and comfort. This nation doesn’t need a movement of Black Lives Matter or Any Lives Matter… this nation needs more Christian people doing their duty as Christians to succor the weak or weary. Our national campaign shouldn’t be #BLM but #WWJD. We all need to remember when we go to work, the grocery store or drive down the street… what would Jesus do, what would he do for YOU? What HAS Jesus done for your family? How can you reciprocate Jesus’ love and be more like Him who suffered every inhumanity there was and then rose above it all? Thanks Mark Ross for giving me my perspective back. I’m grateful you posted this. God Bless your family in this time of need. Here’s his selfie with the Sgt. This is what he wrote about it: At 3am I got a phone call stating that my sister had been killed in a car accident due to some young dumb punk! I haven’t slept and instantly got on the road. Of course we were speeding, trying to get back to Detroit. And we got pulled over in Ohio. I knew I was going to Jail due to a petty warrant. The police called Wayne county and they refused to come get me because of the distance. I explained to the officer that my sister had died and that I needed to get to my mother asap. I broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry. He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY. He offered to bring me 100 miles further to Detroit because they towed the vehicle.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

Bush, offered his reasoning on supporting Trump over Hillary Clinton in an interview with MSNBC that aired Thursday: “I look at it and say, I don’t agree with either of them 100 percent of the time, but who do I think would be best for the country, and what do I think is acceptable?” Story Continued Below “Maybe not preferred. But acceptable, as opposed to what’s unacceptable, and I think truthfulness and believability and,” Rumsfeld said, pausing before concluding: “Truthfulness is important.” MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle followed up, asking, “You think he’s truthful?” “I think he's not untruthful,” Rumsfeld elaborated. “And I think she is.” According to recent polling, both candidates face the perception among many voters that they are dishonest, and Clinton has grappled with voters’ belief that she is untrustworthy, fueled by criticisms over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. But Trump, too, has repeatedly made false statements on the campaign trail, to the point that some critics have accused him of propagating conspiracy theories. He only last week backed down from his false claim that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Ruhle also asked Rumsfeld about reports that former President George H. Bush plans to vote for Clinton, rather than Trump, in November. Rumsfeld said he’s not surprised, and asked why, Rumsfeld replied, “He’s up in years.” “So are you,” Ruhle said back.

The Clinton campaign confirmed it did invite Cuban and that his ticket is ""one of the best seats we have available"" at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. “I’m excited to see what happens, but I really don’t know what to expect,"" Cuban told ABC News today at the red carpet premiere for the ABC show ""Shark Tank."" ""Obviously, I’m a not a Trump fan. I am a Clinton fan,"" Cuban said. ""I think she’d make a great president. I don’t think he’s got the skill set. Let’s put it this way, if he came on 'Shark Tank,' I wouldn’t make the investment. I just don’t see him as being capable in the least bit.” Cuban officially endorsed Clinton for president on Twitter on July 29 and introduced her and running-mate Sen. Tim Kaine at their campaign rally the next day in Pittsburgh. During an appearance on the Netflix show ""Chelsea,"" Cuban said he even offered to play the role of Trump in Clinton's mock debates. Cuban said he emailed someone on the campaign but never heard back. He has emerged as a critic of Trump, questioning whether the New York real estate mogul is actually worth $10 billion, as Trump has claimed, and calling on the Republican presidential nominee to release his taxes. “What he’s done well is put his name on big buildings. ... He’s good at that. Now, whether or not that makes him a billionaire, I don’t know,” Cuban said of Trump in a June interview on 77 WABC’s “Bernie and Sid Radio Show” in New York City. “He’s not transparent enough for us to know that.” Cuban trolled Trump recently by offering $10 million in exchange for an interview on Trump's policies.  .1) @realDonaldTrump $10mm to the charity of YOUR choice if you let ME interview you for 4 hrs on YOUR policies and their substance.         Cuban called Trump ""probably the best thing to happen to politics in a long time"" in a statement last year on Cyber Dust, a private messaging app Cuban created. In September of last year, Cuban gave Trump the American Airlines Center in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, free of charge for one of his biggest rallies during the fall cycle. At that Sept. 14 rally last year, Trump called Cuban ""a great guy"" and thanked him for allowing him to use the arena. Back in May, during the veepstakes, Cuban said on ESPN Radio's “Capital Games” podcast that he's ""wide open"" to being a running mate for either candidate. But the relationship between Trump and Cuban quickly soured.  Cuban, in an interview with EXTRA June 21, unloaded on Trump: ""It’s rare that you see someone get stupider before your eyes, but he’s really working at it. ...You have to give him credit. It’s a difficult thing to do, but he’s accomplished it."" Cuban went on to explain the reasoning for his 180 on Trump. “He sent me an email when I started picking on him. … What happened was I really didn’t like Ted Cruz, so I started helping Donald, tried to encourage him, because I thought he’d be, and to this day thought he’d be a better candidate than Ted Cruz. ... But at some point, you’ve got to start learning and understanding the issues, you know?” he said in that interview. “Donald has been at this a year but you don’t look at him and say, ‘Wow, he’s gotten so much smarter on this topic or that topic.'

Jean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and she wasn’t just any member. Shepard was known as the “Grand Lady”. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years – which is how she earned the name.  The Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for. Of course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn’t the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all. “Sixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,…I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much. Isn’t it terrible being so truthful?”  The Grand Lady passed away from complications due to Parkinson’s disease on September 25, 2016. Jean’s publicist shared about her life in a press release and we are heartbroken. “Jean was born Ollie Imogene Shepard in Oklahoma and raised one of ten children in Visalia, California. At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she’d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band’s ‘girl singer.'” There is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady.

Below is each candidate's guest list, as confirmed by their campaigns: Clinton: Mark Cuban: The brash owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, has emerged as one of Clinton's fieriest attack dogs, repeatedly taunting Trump both on Twitter and the campaign trail.

632,"In his final speech to the worthless United Nations Security Council, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah urged that Americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government. In stark contrast to founding father Benjamin Franklin, who uttered the famous words, “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety,” Obama called on Americans to give up more liberty for security.  “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints,” Obama said. He then added that “powerful nations” like the United States must give up their autonomy to realize security. “I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” Obama said. Of course, Obama was doing this to praise the United Nations, an organization that is anti-American, anti-Christian and totalitarian at its core. So, what’s the problem? Obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line? Wasn’t he the guy that was convinced Obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance? Did that materialize? Nope. This man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we’ve documented that. While Obama, a clear foreigner by his words, his wife’s word’s, a Kenyan Ambassador and the record of the Kenyan Parliament (despite what Trump and others say), claims that his view is the right one, he also acknowledges that real Americans, born and bred here, oppose him. These people do so rightly. “Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run…” Obama said. “We have to put our money where our mouths are.” Yes, but the problem is America is not normal to the international community. She has been unique throughout her history. She was unique because her foundation was established upon the Bible, not upon “international norms,” which were pagan in origin. That’s what made America great. “I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,” Obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the US border. “We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back.” While I do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature, which George Washington acknowledged we should do, I disagree with how Obama believes that we do that. His idea is to reward bad behavior, even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united States. That is not only unconstitutional, it’s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things. Yet, Congress and the people have allowed him to do it. Finally, Obama stated that the United Nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation. No, it was not. The majority of countries in the United Nations are either Communists, Socialists or Islamists. There is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least.

620,"When George H.W. Bush endorsed Hillary Clinton, quite a few people stumbled in their tracks. The progressives see this as a justification of their agenda and a feather in the cap of their candidate. The conservatives see it as a betrayal and a mystery. Pat Caddell has dug up the root of the problem. It is old fashioned protection of the inside the beltway elite. Trump and Sanders have led the revolution, so their power base is endangered.  Read and then click the link at the bottom of the post and listen!!  As Written By Dan Riehl for Breitbart: Long-time Democratic pollster Pat Caddell joinedBreitbart News DailySiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss recent polling, as well as news that former President George H.W. Bush may be voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. “This is a protection racket here, and they have never been under greater threat,” said Caddell, referencing the candidacy of GOP nominee Donald Trump. “It’s not surprising in a way,” he continued. “We misunderstand that this Trump thing is not so much an ideological contest, even a partisan contest. It’s really an insurgency against the political class by the people. That’s why both Bernie Sanders and Trump did so well” in their respective primaries. Added Caddell, “Behind closed doors, what you have is a sense of an alliance,” pointing out that while one party may be up and the other down at times, they still “eat at the same trough” in Washington. Caddell went on to discuss recent polling, as well as what to expect going forward. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern…..

470,"The Republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network Monday. While some candidates including Hillary Clinton have paid for local Snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide. Snapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says ""Debate Day: Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary"" before sharing with friends. The filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again.""  Related: Say hello to Snap Inc. Anyone can create a filter on Snapchat using the app's Geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. It's unclear how much Trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sponsored filters have long been a way for Snapchat -- now rebranded as Snap Inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app. Related: 100 million? Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate Trump and Clinton have used other social media networks, including Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30), to target younger audiences. But Snapchat is notoriously popular with teens and millennials -- a core group of voters both candidates hope to win over. ""Rather than actually try and persuade people, the Trump campaign is throwing money into a fire pit,"" the Clinton campaign said in a statement. ""[This features] a joke that, given Trump's deep unpopularity with young voters, will be used mainly at their own expense.""

Between the two major party candidates, Clinton has used Snapchat more so far. Earlier this year, Clinton's camp launched a filter which targeted those attending a Trump rally in California. Clinton also released one during the Republican National Convention, which featured a quote from Trump about how Clinton would make a great president. During the primaries, presidential hopefuls like Bernie Sanders also used a filter during a Clinton rally. NMLS #1136",1,0,0
167,"There’s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police. Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks’ star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: “I’m not going to answer any questions today, and it’s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people’s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they’re being ignored. Whether they’re taking a knee or whether they’re locking arms, you know, they’re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point. The reason these guys are kneeling. The reason we’re locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know, it’s not right for people to get killed in the street.” Sherman then explains how he’s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says, “that’s an unfortunate time to be living.” Especially when people are being killed for no reason. He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: “When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he’s not being patriotic. He’s not honoring the flag. I’m doing none of those things. I’m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something.” And something most certainly needs to be done, and done now. Watch Sherman speak here: Wow— this is a must-watch.

1312,"Donald Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes. He claimed she lacked the “stamina” to serve as commander-in-chief. And when the question of his attitude towards women became an explicit topic of debate, he seemed to allude to resisting the urge to use her husband’s marital infidelity against her. Trump has been aggressive and crude with male debate opponents, too, and he addressed the former Cabinet secretary by her proper title throughout the sparring. But, going up against the first woman to take to a debate stage as a major party nominee in American history, did Trump come across as sexist? Story Continued Below According to Vox, he interrupted her nearly once a minute for the first 26 minutes of the debate. By 538’s count, Trump seized the floor from Clinton three times and lodged 24 interjections as she spoke, a total of 27 interruptions. Clinton didn’t seize the floor from Trump once, and lodged only 5 interjections. The pro-Clinton American Bridge counted a total of 73 interruptions by Trump. The appearance of chauvinistic bullying can be deadly for a male politician debating a female opponent. Just ask Rick Lazio, who sunk his 2000 Senate bid against Clinton when he left his podium mid-debate in an attempt to force her to sign a campaign finance pledge. Trump has thrived by indulging his natural inclination towards aggression, but has also been tripped up on his attitude towards women and issues that matter to them – like when Carly Fiorina confronted him for deriding the appearance of her face and when he was forced to walk back a statement that women should be punished for getting illegal abortions. And the risks for Trump are magnified. His opponents have consistently accused him of misogyny and his hopes in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania rest on suburban Republican women who are uneasy with the choice. After the debate, the Clinton campaign wasn’t touching the sexism question. “He has so much wrong with his performance tonight that something like that didn't even enter my mind,” said press secretary Brian Fallon. But others saw unmistakable chauvinism in Trump’s approach. “First of all the interruptions, he talked over her numerous times, the way he rolled his eyes…that to me was indicative of the gender issue,” said former North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat. Trump himself seemed to sense a potential trap when moderator Lester Holt asked him to explain his prior comment that Clinton doesn’t have a presidential “look.” He quickly pivoted away from her physical appearance. “She doesn't have the look,” Trump responded. “She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina, and I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.” Clinton shot back by citing her diplomatic forays to hundreds of countries and the 11 hours she spent before the House committee investigating the Benghazi killings. Then she knocked Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, saying, “He called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.” Trump responded by saying, “I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ‘I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.’” After the debate, Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani said Trump was restraining himself from calling Clinton “phony as a feminist.” “This is the thing about Donald Trump is he has a big heart. He saw Chelsea in the audience, and he didn’t say what he was ready to say,” said Giuliani. According to the former New York mayor, Trump was preparing to say, “You take money from countries that stone women. You take money from countries that imprison women. You take money from countries where women can’t drive. You take money – not money, millions and hundreds of millions of dollars – from countries that treat women as cattle. You attack Monica Lewinsky, saying that she was basically insane, when it turned out your husband basically violated an intern in Oval Office of the White House, disgraced the United States of America, and you were one of the primary attackers, and after your years with Bill Clinton, if you don’t know that Monica Lewinsky was telling the truth then you’re not smart enough to be president.” Giuliani’s counterpunch aside, it was Trump who faced more post-debate scrutiny on gender issues. Republican women are crucial to Trump’s chances, and those watching the debate fell into two camps: Those who sensed sexism and those who felt gender dynamics were the least of Trump’s problems on Monday night. Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who opposed Trump in the primary, said he came across as “the kind of guy ever woman out there has rolled her eyes at and turned down flat at least a couples times in her life.” Katie Packer Gage, another Republican strategist who opposed Trump in the primary said that the unscripted environment brought out the impulses that caused Trump so much trouble before his recent streak of relative message discipline. “He has such a long record of demeaning and disparaging and bullying women that this is just a reminder of so many things that have been kind of forgotten in the last week because he’s sort of learned how to behave in proper company when he’s scripted,” she said. But other Republican women saw it as a red herring. “I thought it was many things but not sexist,” said conservative commentator Dana Loesch, a frequent Trump critic, of the businessman’s performance. “I think a discussion of stamina with respect to any sex is fair game when the context is commander-in-chief.” “For Trump standards, he was fairly subdued. At least he didn’t call her fat and ugly and tell her her voice game him a headache,” zinged Republican commentator Ana Navarro, who has sparred with Trump this campaign season. To Sarah Isgur Flores, Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager, Trump treated Clinton the way he’s treated his male opponents. “Hillary’s team would e making a mistake crying foul over Trump being Trump,” she said. “It can only take away from her performance at this point.” Clinton’s performance aside, her face remained an object of analysis. While Trump resisted the invitation to weigh in again on her physical appearance, Fox News’ Brit Hume filled that gap for him. “The Trump expression was one we’re all familiar with from the earlier debates – he looked annoyed, put out, uncomfortable,” Hume said after the debate. “And she looked, I think for the most part, she looked composed — smug sometimes — not necessarily attractive.” Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.",1,0,0
1458,"There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.  But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter. What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything? To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference. The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? If a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? How does that even make sense? Oh that’s right, it doesn’t. Of course, that doesn’t stop progressives from declaring that they know exactly how things should be happening. You know, with their degrees in women’s studies and art history, they’re clearly the most qualified people to be criticizing the actions of our law enforcement. ",0,0,1
137,"That wacky, deplorable, Oompa Loompa stand-in Donald Trump is at it again! As part of his continuing African-American “outreach” — which has traditionally consisted  of calling black people uneducated, unemployed and desperate, and their communities poor (“no health care, no education, no anything” as he puts it), and posting white supremacist memes demonizing black people. While Trump’s white supporters love this rhetoric because it a.) confirms their biases against African-Americans and b.) seems to them that he is trying to fix problems they suspect exist, proving he’s not the racist pig liberals say he is, the rest of us wonder how anyone can think a guy who literally labeled black rental applicants’ forms with “C” and practiced discrimination could be viewed as a person who would do anything at all to help the black community. On Tuesday, Trump again continued his outreach — or, as the rest of us see it, again made his disdain for black people known — by telling African-Americans (or, more correctly, a room full of white people) that black communities are “in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever.” .@realDonaldTrump: African-American communities ""in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever."" https://t.co/9LBPglLJSo — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 20, 2016  Naturally, the Internet had some remarks about this, with many wondering how he forgot about Jim Crow, slavery, and other times the black community might have had it just a teensy bit harder in America: @ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Slavery?

612,"It was only a matter of time before the military would start reeducating servicemen (or is it “servicepeople?”) about how to behave around others who are born with one set of sex organs but “identify” as a member of the opposite sex. All troops will be required to be trained in how to behave around transgender people by July of 2017, coinciding with the date that the Navy will begin accepting transgender recruits. Military.com reported: In an all-Navy message published Tuesday, Chief of Naval Personnel Vice Adm. Robert Burke said a three-pronged training approach will equip senior leaders and rank-and-file personnel for the changes. “This training will emphasize policies and expectations of personal behavior,” the message states. Beginning Nov. 1, mobile training teams composed of Navy fleet representatives and subject matter expects will be dispatched to deliver face-to-face briefs to senior leaders, including commanding officers, executive officers, command master chiefs, and chiefs of boat. These sessions will also be open to equal opportunity advisers, ombudsmen and other command-designated representatives who will have a role in training the tenant commands on policies governing transgender troops. Along with permitting transgender troops to serve openly, the military is creating procedures for troops to change their “gender marker” in the administrative Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, and laying out rules to govern how troops might undergo medical gender transitions while in uniform. Transgender troops will be required to use the bathroom and berthing facilities associated with their preferred gender, Navy officials have said. And service leaders will be on alert for those who seek to single out or mistreat their transgender counterparts. The Military Times reported that transgender troops are now eligible to receive sex-reassignment surgery paid for by the Pentagon (taxpayers) as long as they’re active-duty, and there is approval from their doctors and military health officials. The surgical procedure to rearrange the active duty military member’s genitals to vaguely resemble those of the opposite sex can be performed at a military hospital, or if it’s not available at the time – or if there’s a long wait time – Tricare will cover it at a private hospital.

1534,"In less than 48 hours, over the course of this past weekend, 22 people have been shot, two fatally, in the city of Chicago. This, only days after Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s speech on violence in which he proposed more police and mentoring programs for “at risk youth”, meaning those who are doing the killing. The only people at risk are the innocent citizens on the wrong end of the Windy City’s gangster’s guns. These thugs and killers are not “at risk”. They have already plunged to the depths of thuggery and evil. Hey Mayor, how about some programs for those who are truly at risk, the law abiding people of your city. How about a “program” that starts arresting and prosecuting thugs with illegal guns? We know Chicago is a gun free heavenly haven, right? Wrong. There are more guns in Chicago than in many third world nations. And speaking of third world nations, that’s what it’s like to live in the life or death neighborhoods of Chicago.   The Mayor is calling for more police. And yet police are being maligned, killed, shot at, protested against and generally disrespected by the very people you are trying to help by sending them in. Get control of the gangsters and thugs in your city with a seriously tough anti-crime initiative like Mayor Giuliani did in New York during his term and watch the homicide rate start dropping. But words mean nothing when a six year-old girl is hit by gangster gunfire and someone’s cousin walking her three month-old loses her life merely by leaving the house. Mayor Emanuel, your city will know you are serious when fewer people die. You are crying on stage, while the people are dying in the streets. Seems inappropriate not to mention useless.

490,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign manager dismissed as ""absurd"" Donald Trump's Monday night debate claim that she admitted a campaign ally pushed ""birther"" conspiracy rumors. ""It is absurd what Donald Trump just said,"" Patti Solis Doyle said minutes after the debate's end. ""I never sent anyone to Kenya to look for his birth certificate."" Asked about his role in boosting and perpetuating birtherism earlier in the evening, Trump pointed to a CNN appearance from last week, when -- as he put it -- Solis Doyle ""was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. (Clinton confidant Sidney) Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard."" No, Hillary Clinton did not start the 'birther' movement But as Solis Doyle said during the post-debate panel -- and a transcript from September 16 confirms -- she made no such claim. During her interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Solis Doyle flatly denied the campaign had any role in creating the conspiracy theory, instead recalling the firing of a volunteer for forwarding a chain email suggesting Obama was Muslim. ""There was a volunteer coordinator, I believe in late 2007, I think in December, one of our volunteer coordinators in one of the counties in Iowa (who sent the email),"" she said during the initial interview. ""Hillary made the decision immediately to let that person go. We let that person go. Clinton puts Trump on defense at first debate Both then and on Monday night, Solis Doyle said the Clinton campaign apologized to the Obama campaign, which accepted the explanation according to former Obama political strategist David Axelrod.

688,"Chapter II from my book The Trump Revolution (available at Amazon) Read Chapter I here. The Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite! Before I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable business men, I want to note two points: The first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. With the “country,” I mean America, not China or Mexico. The second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. Let me say something. When you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game, even if you don’t like them. However, if you head the federation of that sport, you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in. Now we are ready for the whipping. The elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. You can even call them the neo-lords. Let’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from. America is the land of the free. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free. At the old time, the lord was the owner and the ruler. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches. The lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. The system developed. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence. Apparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full. In the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. And so, less shoppers and buyers. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing. The elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again. That is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done. The corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. So how should an honorable businessman be? The businessman is a career. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics. So what are the duties? The businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. He has to take part in building the country. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do. What are our elite-businessmen doing? They are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!! I hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm…….   The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..” Congratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers. Imagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves. Imagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves. What are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers? Could they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no. Selfishness, greed. I would say treason. The elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns. If they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. They just found themselves loosing. The elite-businessmen’s media Here we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. Trump should be proud they are all against him. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!! What should the job of the media be? Showing the people the truth about what is happening. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Explaining what is being plotted against them. That is what they are supposed to do. But, what are they really doing? Tranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire. WAKE UP AMERICA!!! Have you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. Have they shown all of that on their screens? But you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here. The elite-businessmen’s politicians Welcome to the employees of the elite-businessmen. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats. Most of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. They are playing a game they call an election. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc. Were the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them? The people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change. Let me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs: The elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be-president: You look like you can make a good president… You are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you… We will make you president in return for a favor……. We want you to do so and so…. If you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal…. You get us angry and you are a dead dog…. End of the scenario. It is literally a deal with the devil. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people. Listen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks.

The U.S base outside Qayyarah, 25 miles south of Mosul, came under rocket fire, and traces of a “mustard agent” were believed to be present, the official said. The attack was first reported by CNN. A Pentagon official told reporters that a “tar-like black oily substance” was found on one of the shells that landed within the base, only hundreds of yards from U.S. forces. An initial test for the agent was positive, but “could be false,” the official said. The second test was negative, possibly because the shell had been exposed to the elements. The official said the base is attacked “fairly often” with conventional weapons, but Tuesday’s assault is believed to be the first chemical attack on U.S. forces in Iraq since they returned to the country in 2014. Nearly 5,000 U.S. troops are currently on the ground in Iraq and “hundreds” of those forces are located at the base, the official said. Read more… ",0,0,1

1166,"TULSA, Okla. — Prosecutors charged a white Oklahoma police officer with first-degree manslaughter Thursday, less than a week after she fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street and just days after police released graphic videos, saying in court documents that the officer ""reacted unreasonably."" Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Tulsa officer Betty Shelby in the Sept. 16 shooting death of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher. Kunzweiler said arrangements were being made for Shelby's surrender. Story Continued Below Shelby ""reacted unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation with Mr. Crutcher, who was not responding to verbal commands and was walking away from her with his hands held up, becoming emotionally involved to the point that she over reacted,"" according to an affidavit filed with the charge. The swift action in Tulsa stood in contrast to Charlotte, North Carolina, where police refused under mounting pressure Thursday to release video of the shooting of another black man this week and the National Guard was called in to try to a head off a third night of violence. Demonstrations in Tulsa since Crutcher's death have been consistently peaceful. Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. The footage does not offer a clear view of when Shelby fired the single shot that killed Crutcher. Her attorney has said Crutcher was not following police commands and that Shelby opened fire when the man began to reach into his SUV window. But Crutcher's family immediately discounted that claim, saying the father of four posed no threat to the officers. They also pointed to an enlarged photo from police footage that appears to show Crutcher's window was rolled up. And police said Crutcher did not have gun on him or in his vehicle. An affidavit filed Thursday says Shelby told police homicide investigators that ""she was in fear for her life and thought Mr. Crutcher was going to kill her. When she began following Mr. Crutcher to the vehicle with her duty weapon drawn, she was yelling for him to stop and get on his knees repeatedly."" Crutcher was wearing ""baggy clothes"" but that Shelby ""was not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present,"" the affidavit states. Among the definitions in Oklahoma for first-degree manslaughter is a killing ""perpetrated unnecessarily either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a crime, or after such attempt shall have failed."" If convicted, Shelby could face a minimum of four years in prison. Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett said police worked quickly to provide Kunzweiler with the information he needed to decide whether to charge the officer. ""I appreciate their efforts as well as the District Attorney's usual thorough evaluation of the rules of law for which we are all accountable,"" Bartlett said in a written statement. ""These are important steps to ensure that justice and accountability prevails. ""We will continue to be transparent and ensure the system carries out its responsibility to provide justice."" Shelby, who joined the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, was en route to a domestic violence call when she encountered Crutcher's vehicle abandoned on a city street, straddling the center line. Shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashboard camera, so no footage exists of what first happened between the two before other officers arrived. The police footage shows Crutcher approaching the driver's side of the SUV, then more officers walk up and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. A man inside a police helicopter overhead says: ""That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something."" Police Sgt. Dave Walker has said investigators found a vial of the drug PCP in Crutcher's vehicle. Shelby's attorney, Scott Wood, has said that Shelby completed drug-recognition expert training and thought Crutcher was acting like he might be under the influence of PCP. Attorneys for Crutcher's family said the family didn't know whether drugs were found in the SUV, but that even if they were, it wouldn't justify the shooting. A toxicology report could take several weeks. In the videos, the officers surround Crutcher and he suddenly drops to the ground. A voice heard on police radio says: ""Shots fired!"" The officers back away and Crutcher is left unattended on the street for about two minutes before an officer puts on medical gloves and begins to attend to him. ""The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community,"" Kunzweiler said. ""It's important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process."" At least two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse after the district attorney announced the charges, with some saying they were not happy that Shelby wasn't charged with first-degree murder. ""We will be out here every single day until she gets murder,"" Tulsa resident Tammi Sims said. Earlier this year, a former volunteer deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of Eric Harris, who was also black and unarmed.",1,0,0
529,"Washington (CNN)Spending by super PACs tied to Donald Trump friends such as Ben Carson and banker Andy Beal will help make this week the general election's most expensive yet. Republicans and Democrats will spend almost $28 million on radio and television this week, according to advertising records, as Trump substantially increases his advertising buy for the final stretch. He's spending $6.4 million in nine states, part of what aides have said will be a $100 million television campaign through Election Day. Trump on Tuesday began reserving time on broadcast and cable through November 8. And he's getting help on other mediums, too. Beal, a Dallas billionaire who doubles as a semi-professional poker player, has started his own super PAC that has spent $1 million on pro-Trump newspaper and digital advertisements. With a net worth estimated to be $9 billion, Beal is effectively spurning the other Trump super PACs who had courted him relentlessly. It is unlikely that Beal's group, Save America from Its Government, will do television. But Jacob Cherner, a Beal aide, said he could not put a limit on how much Beal would spend. ""I know his interest is intense,"" Cherner said. Another new group helping Trump in the homestretch. A formerly pro-Carson super PAC, The 2016 Committee, is spending more than $1 million on ads for Trump on African-American radio in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, per records. ""If Ben Carson trusts Donald Trump, so can we,"" the narrator says in one new spot. Republicans all together are spending about $8.5 million on radio and television. Democrats are spending about $19.5 million -- thanks to $11.4 million from Hillary Clinton's campaign, and $7.5 million from Priorities USA, her super PAC. ",1,0,0
487,"(CNN)Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump disputed Monday that Russia may be behind a series of cyberattacks on election systems in the US and on the Democratic National Committee -- a conclusion that US officials and lawmakers have come to. The New York real estate mogul questioned Russian culpability in response to comments by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton at the first presidential debate pointing the finger at Russia for recent breaches. ""She says, 'Russia, Russia, Russia,' "" Trump said. ""It could be China. You don't know who broke into the DNC."" He continued, ""It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds."" But Clinton said there was ""no doubt"" that Russia has been responsible, an assessment top US security authorities and members of congressional intelligence committees support. ""Cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president,"" Clinton warned at the event in Hempstead, New York. Recent hacks have targeted state election boards and the Democratic National Committee. The FBI is currently investigating. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, and Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat on the House intelligence committee, recently released a statement saying that ""based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the US election."" On Monday, Clinton also issued an implicit threat to Russia that the US could hit back hard and would do so if necessary. ""The United States has much greater capacity,"" Clinton said, ""and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private sector information or our public sector information."" ""We don't want to have to use the kinds of tools we have, but we will defend the citizens of this country and the Russians need to understand that,"" Clinton said. Clinton added that Russia's suspected hacking attempts on US voting systems were one reason she was ""so shocked when Donald asked Putin to hack into Americans,"" a reference to Trump's comments during a July news conference. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"" from the private server Clinton used while secretary of state for official business and was later destroyed, Trump said at that event. Foreign policy issues were a relatively minor part of the debate, but each candidate tried to use national security issues to score points. Trump claimed that Clinton has done such a bad job of managing global crises and Middle East conflict that she has been fighting ISIS her ""whole life."" The group that evolved into ISIS formed in 2006, while Clinton was born in 1947. For her part, Clinton targeted Trump's claims that the US should consider letting South Korea and Japan manage their own defense without American support. ""Words matter,"" Clinton said. ""Words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president, and I want to assure our allies in South Korea and Japan and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them."" In response, Trump qualified his position, saying, ""as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help our allies, but we cannot be the policeman of the world."" ",1,0,0

Authorities encountered Stein on the college campus in Hempstead, New York, and asked the third-party candidate, who has not garnered enough support to participate in the debates, to show the proper credentials, which she could not do, police said. She was “nicely escorted” off the grounds around 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, a Nassau County Police Department spokesman told ABC News. Stein tweeted about the incident, saying she was on the campus “doing an interview” when police put her and her team “in a van” and escorted them off the school’s grounds. Earlier, Stein’s campaign said she obtained a credential to go in and do interviews at the media filing center in the early afternoon.  After being escorted from Hofstra campus for doing an interview, police put us in a van which was stopped not once, but twice. #debatenight pic.twitter.com/IgQJMoCNWZ  Stein had planned to challenge her exclusion from tonight’s event by hosting a rally outside the secured perimeter of the debate hall beginning, around 5 p.m. Eastern time.

Stein’s campaign said she will not “risk arrest” this time, because there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest over her involvement in a recent protest against a controversial pipeline project in North Dakota. Still, her campaign spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa said they will attempt to get the “spirited demonstration … as close to the gates as possible.""

1002,"Chuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he’s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader. The New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm on Tuesday. He’s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said. Story Continued Below Earlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls. Republicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way. “The Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,” said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. “We’re just trying to allocate our resources so they’re meaningful to us and our candidates.” Schumer’s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head. Schumer’s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party’s candidates and a reflection of Democrats’ future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade. Schumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates’ committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He’s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that’s projected to bring in “upwards of another million,” according to a person close to the New York senator. “Schumer has been relentless,” said a DSCC official. Schumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them. “Leader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,” McCue said in a statement. Schumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition. Schumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer’s colleagues won’t rule out the possibility that he’ll donate more to his party’s Senate takeover effort. “If he thinks it will make a difference, he’ll do it. He’s very calculating,” said a Democratic senator. “Chuck will be there if you need him.” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more. “He’s going to watch everything closely. It’s my sense he’s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,” Stabenow said. There’s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option. “We’re going to make some tough decisions, which haven’t been made yet,” Reid said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he’ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash. “I don’t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,” Thune said in an interview. Republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning. Republicans, however, simply don’t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win. “He’s a machine,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But “it may not make a difference,” the Texan added.",1,0,0
138,"All the excitement about the 2016 presidential election isnât limited to the U.S. alone. Media from around the globe are covering this race, too. And just like U.S. media, so too is foreign press particularly keeping a watchful eye on â you guessed it â Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Heâs been a hot topic in international articles, editorials and broadcasts, and which pertain to everything from his bizarre and xenophobic statements to the violence at his campaign events. One particularly effective way that foreign media have been able to express their opinions on The Donald is through political cartoons. Those editorials of art can capture a lot more public attention, and often with a lot more punch. Like these 12 in particular (first collected byÂ Politico): By Christo Komarnitski  byÂ Petar Pismestrovic ofÂ Kleine Zeitung Â   ByÂ Micheal De Adder of the Halifax Chronicle Herald By Paresh Nath of The Khaleej Times This one isnât against Trump alone, though.

The phraseÂ translates word-for-word to âToward an eclipse of the moonâ â or âToward a lunar eclipse.â It seems to refer toÂ legends about lunar eclipsesÂ (or âblood moonsâ) being bad luck, and how (at least) one culture would try to avoid that bad luck. In ancient Mesopotamia, a lunar eclipse was believed to indicate seven demons were coming to Earth to attack a king. In response, one commoner would falsely pose as the king â a body double who would take the harm in case the demons attacked. (And when the lunar eclipse was over, the pretend king would be killed.) In other words, then, this one implies that Trump is in the race only as a pretend candidate who could get Republican Party nomination, but who will only fall to Clinton in the general election.

613,"There’s a reason far-left, progressive whack job Senator Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname Fauxcohantas. She’s as phony as a $3 bill. Warren earned that nickname after it was discovered that she lied for years about being part Native American, then when confronted, she touted her “Pow Pow’s” high cheekbones as evidence that he was Native American. She rails against Wall Street when she has made millions because of Wall Street. Warren went after Donald Trump when it was reported that he made money flipping houses without disclosing that she has done the same. We should be used to Warren’s feigning outrage because she does so when it is politically expedient. That leads to the Senate hearing today in which Warren grilled the CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, over thousands of workers being caught setting up fake accounts in order to earn bonuses. Wells Fargo has since fired those workers and said that there could be more people let go if they discover further shenanigans. But that wasn’t enough for Fauxcohantas. She had to get up on her hypocritical high horse when the cameras were running to score her political talking points. Although the individuals who actually bilked the customers out of money were fired, Warren has the audacity to chastise the Wells Fargo CEO because senior executives were not fired accusing him of “gutless leadership.” “You haven’t fired a single senior executive. Instead, evidently, your definition of accountable is to push the blame to low-level employees who don’t have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend themselves. It’s gutless leadership.” Where were these words from Elizabeth Warren when Barack Obama blamed low-level IRS employees in Cincinnati for the IRS targeting, harassing, and intimidation of conservative and Tea Party groups? Where were these tough words when it turned out people at the top not only knew what was going on but orchestrated it? Where was Fauxcohontas when Lois Lerner was able to retire with a cushy pension and faced absolutely no repercussions for her hand in the scandal. Where was Warren when Obama lied to the American people in an interview with Bill O’Reilly before the Super Bowl when he said there wasn’t a smidgen of corruption? And did Elizabeth Warren demand that VA executives who were keeping fake log books in order to get bonuses be fired? Did she go on record of accusing Barack Obama of “gutless leadership” for his failure to fire anyone when it came to the VA scandal or the IRS scandal? Did she say Obama created the environment for such despicable practices to occur, practices which led to the death of hundreds of veterans and impact on the livelihood of Americans who were simply practicing their First Amendment rights in criticizing their government? No. Elizabeth Warren didn’t say a damn word about those things. Why? Because it would not have been politically expedient. Yes, there’s a reason Elizabeth Warren was given the nickname “Fauxcahontas.” She’s a big, filthy, hypocritical fake and political opportunist. That was exposed and made perfectly clear with her rant against the Wells Fargo CEO. Watch Elizabeth “Fauxcahontas” Warren in all her hypocritical glory.   Email Subscribe",0,0,1
87,"Donald Trump ended one of the sharpest exchanges in last night's debate against Hillary Clinton with a pointed question: ""Why did she delete 33,000 emails?"" Clinton is doing her best to move beyond the controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state, saying only last night that she ""made a mistake"" and declining to address why those emails were deleted. She didn't answer Trump's questions. However, there is an answer. The bottom line: Clinton believed the deleted emails were not work-related.     In late 2014, the State Department asked Clinton and other former secretaries of state to hand over any work-related emails they may have. By then, Clinton had already ""deleted some [emails] over time as an ordinary user would,"" FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers at a July congressional hearing. And she tasked her legal team to determine which of the roughly 60,000 emails still on her server were work-related. ""Clinton told the FBI that she directed her legal team to provide any work-related or arguably work-related emails to State; however she did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used or in discussions of the locations of where her emails might exist,"" the FBI concluded in its investigative summary of the case. Comey testified that the FBI ""didn't find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice."" To determine which emails were work-related, a member of Clinton’s legal team did four things: she automatically deemed any email sent from or to a .gov and .mil address as related to work; she searched the tens of thousands of emails for names of senior State Department officials, lawmakers, foreign leaders and other government officials; she conducted a keyword search for work-related terms; and she looked at the sender, recipient and ""subject"" of every email for other potentially work-related emails, but she did not read the contents of those emails. In December 2014, Clinton’s legal team provided about 30,000 emails -- totaling 55,000 pages -- to the State Department. ""[Clinton] then was asked by her lawyers at the end, 'Do you want us to keep the personal emails?' And she said, 'I have no use for them anymore.' It's then that they issued the direction that the technical people delete them,"" Comey told lawmakers. In total, more than 30,000 emails were deleted ""because they were personal and private about matters that I believed were within the scope of my personal privacy,"" Clinton told reporters in March of 2015, as the controversy around her private emails was growing. ""They had nothing to do with work,"" Clinton added. ""I didn't see any reason to keep them ... no one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy."" Clinton said her team ""went through a thorough process"" to identify work-related emails, and she said he had ""absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department."" However, after a year-long investigation, the FBI recovered more than 17,000 emails that had been deleted or otherwise not turned over to the State Department, and many of them were work-related, the FBI has said. Republican critics have accused Clinton of using a private server and ultimately deleting emails to skirt federal records laws aimed at promoting transparency, and earlier this month the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said, ""The sequence of events leading up to the destruction of Secretary Clinton’s emails ... raises questions about whether Secretary Clinton, acting through her attorneys, instructed [aides and others] to destroy records relevant to"" a Congressional investigation of the deadly Benghazi attack. At the July hearing before Chaffetz's committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked Comey, ""Did Secretary Clinton know her legal team deleted those emails that they kept from [Congress]?"" ""I don't believe so,"" Comey responded. During Monday night's debate, Trump promised to release his tax returns ""when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted,"" adding that he would ""go against"" the advice of his lawyers ""if she releases her emails."" Moderator Lester Holt then asked Trump if that meant releasing his tax returns was negotiable. Trump responded: ""It's not negotiable. No, let her release her emails. Why did she delete 33,000 emails?""",1,0,0

Sessions expressed frustration with Republicans who've refused to back Trump in an interview with the Washington Examiner published Wednesday. A long-serving Republican senator, he was among the first members of the so-called GOP ""establishment"" to throw his support behind the eventual nominee during the primary, and has been a fixture of the Trump campaign since. ""They should objectively analyze who is likely to advance best the agenda they favor and the agenda the Republicans who supported them favored. And that's clearly Donald Trump,"" Sessions said. The Alabama Republican also noted that ""millions of Americans, including this one, worked their hearts out for the Bushes in 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2004. And it wasn't Bill Clinton that helped the Bushes get elected. It was the same voters, in large part, that elected Ronald Reagan and stand to elect Donald Trump."" The elder Bush is the only member of the family whose support for Clinton has become public. Jeb Bush, whom Trump defeated during the primary, has said he won't support the nominee, and former President George W. Bush has declined to reveal his presidential preference. For Sessions, though, the choice is simple, and he expressed puzzlement about the Bush family. RELATED: Ivanka Trump huddles with female Republican members of Congress in Washington ""I think they're not thinking clearly enough about this,"" Sessions told the Washington Examiner.

And to other Republicans, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who have argued Trump isn't conservative enough to lead the party, Sessions says ""that's ridiculous."" ""At this point in history, it's the William F. Buckley test -- who is the most conservative candidate that can win the presidency? Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?

171,"TrumpâsÂ campaign chair of Mahoning County, Ohio, one of the most crucial counties in the state, made what might be the most delusional statement of the week. She insisted that racism was literally non-existent before Obama was elected. Wow, it doesnât take much to tear apart how this assertion is completely absurd, but weâre going to take the time to do it anyway. In an interview with The Guardian, Kathy Miller, the campaign chair in question, made the following shocking statement: âI donât think there was any racism until Obama got elected. Â We never had problems like this.â She must mean that white people were relatively shielded from being forcedÂ to face the fact that racism is, in fact, abound in white culture.

Â You had all the advantages and didnât take advantage. Â Itâs not our fault, certainly.â *Cringe* Seeing as apparently this isnât evident to people like Kathy Miller, and arguably much of Trumpâs voter base, letâs just go through why this is completely bogus and extremely offensive. She even went so far as to say that racism didnât exist when she grew upâ¦in the 1960s. Â What?! Â Segregation?!?! Black people have had to deal with a racist criminal justice system which unfairly targets their community, damaging their families and placing their children at a disadvantage from the very beginning. Black children have primarily had to go to schools which are dominated by a white power structure, a power structure which has certainly not gotten rid of its racist roots to this day. Â Either that, or they often go to a school which is worse off economically. Black people were literally enslaved or cut off from the resources and wealth of the white by law for centuries. Â The racist nature within that legal system wasnât just erased with the end of segregation. Â Has it improved? Â Sure, but that hasnât addressed the structural racism within our socio-political and economic paradigm. Because of a history of oppression, black people have been economically much worse off. Â And children who come from poor families, as study after study shows, statistically do worse in school. Â They also canât afford skyrocketing college tuition when they get out of high school. Black children are often disproportionately punished in schools, which harms their potential for academic success. Honestly, I could go on and on, and Iâm not even black, so I donât know the half of it. This lady is delusional, her beliefs are dangerous to the health of our society, and the fact that we have this kind of racism so prevalent in the Trump campaign, a United States presidential campaign, is horrifying. But itâs all Obamaâs fault, right? UPDATE: Kathy Miller resigned after blowback from these comments.",0,1,0

1358,"A pilot who ferried GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, his family, staff, secret service contingent and traveling press has been fired following revelations that he faces criminal charges for intentionally hitting a man with his car. The pilot, Vincent Caldara, is a former police officer and chairman of Trump's Florida Law Enforcement Coalition. The news of Caldara’s criminal charges was first reported by The Guardian in an article on potential criminal activities of some of those in law enforcement supporting Trump. Story Continued Below “I’m a very strong Trump supporter, I’m a retired law enforcement officer, and I’m currently on Governor Mike Pence’s flight operations team as one of his pilots during the campaign,” Caldara told a crowd at the opening of a Trump campaign office in Brevard County in early September. “Donald Trump and Governor Mike Pence are the law and order candidates.” Pence’s camp distanced itself from Caldara: “All of our pilots are assigned by the airline,” Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told POLITICO. Caldara “is not and has not been” a paid staffer for the campaign at the state or national level, Lotter added. He referred questions about any volunteer role Caldara has to Trump’s Florida campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment. “He is no longer employed at Eastern Air Lines,” said Nick Loudon, executive director of special projects at Eastern Airlines, the private charter company that flies Pence. He said he could not comment further due to “legal considerations.” Caldara had not flown the Pence plane for several weeks before the news of his assault charge broke. Caldara, 55, is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon after allegedly striking a friend with his vehicle “three times, against his will, causing back and leg injuries,” in July 2015, according to court documents. The two had been in argument, and the victim, whose name is withheld, “stood in front of Caldara’s vehicle as Caldara attempted to leave.” The police report stated that, according to the victim, “Caldara started the vehicle and then drove forward, bumping him with the front bumper of the vehicle…Caldara then drove forward again, striking [the victim] with the front bumper of the vehicle, knocking him to the ground. [The victim] advised he fell to his knees and was struck again by Caldara’s vehicle, knocking him down again. [The victim] stated he crawled out from under the vehicle and then Caldara drove off.” Caldara has pleaded not guilty. Caldara is also being sued by a woman who alleges that Caldara hit her with his motorcycle in 2014, “seriously and severely” injuring her, according to court documents. The complaint alleges that Caldara was driving “carelessly and negligently” when he struck the victim. Caldara’s Twitter account, which appears to have been deleted, listed him as “Chairman of the Florida Law Enforcement Coalition to Elect Donald J. Trump for President.”",1,0,0
758,"via Allen West: When tragic mass attacks occur, the media generally focuses on the attacker, making the victims anonymous factors in the body count. Can you name one victim of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub attack? No of course not, but you surely know the killer. The attacker in the St. Cloud Mall this weekend has been identified as a 22-year-old Somali man and “solider of ISIS.” But let’s ignore him for a moment and focus on the hero who brought him down – because you can be quite certain the liberal media doesn’t want you to know ANYthing about him. His name is Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer and firearms instructor who owns a gun range. Falconer happened to be at the mall when the terrorist began carrying out his attack. The Sun says, Falconer opened fire as the suspect lunged towards him. He got up and continued his terrifying assault each time he was shot until he was eventually fatally wounded. Morning News USA reports, “His (Falconer’s) goal is to teach individuals the mindset, knowledge and skills needed to be successful with firearms in order to secure their personal safety or that of their family, at home or in public,” said Tactical Advantage, the off-duty police officer’s company website.  Falconer told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he’s “been trying to stay away from it all, for the time being.” He told the newspaper he wasn’t hurt and declined to talk further, citing the ongoing investigation for not saying more. Well, we’d like to give Officer Falconer a really big shout-out and thanks. He’s once again proven the best way to stop a bad guy with a knife is a good guy with a GUN. This isn’t the ending liberals want to the story. They also don’t want you to know the attacker was asking victims if they were Muslims before stabbing them. And they certainly don’t want to know an armed citizen was the one who stopped further horror. Facts are nasty things. [Note: This article was written by Michele Hickford] ",0,0,1
694,"It was a busy weekend for miscreant Islamist scum operating under the imprimatur of the international socialist-Islamist axis within America. On Saturday, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a New Jersey resident and naturalized immigrant from Afghanistan, detonated multiple bombs in New York and New Jersey. No one was killed, but nearly 30 people were injured. Rahami was apprehended three days later in Linden, New Jersey, after a gun battle with police. Also on Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir Adan, a Somali Muslim who had been living in the United States for the past 15 years, stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. According to St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson, Adan –who was disguised as a security guard at the time of the attacks – “reportedly made references to Allah during the attack and asked at least one person whether they were Muslim.” Dahir was killed by police at the scene. According to the New York Times, Rahami, the man arrested for the New York and New Jersey bombings, became a “completely different person” after a trip to Afghanistan, when it is presumed he became “radicalized,” a term used by the press and politicos to describe a Muslim who crosses that obscure line from Islamic to militant Islamist. It has also been reported that Rahami made several other trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan without being detected by the U.S. government. Rahami’s father, Mohammed Rahami, told the press this week that he had reported his son to the FBI as a potential terrorist in 2014, but the agency took no action. While the Rahami and Adan stories have received wide press coverage, of course we are still being subjected to the usual spin and politically correct propaganda from the press and politicians, which deftly avoids the motive attendant to these attacks – this being that the perpetrators were Muslims and were acting based on Islamic doctrine. At this point, we’ve now seen several high-profile acts of domestic terrorism perpetrated by Muslims wherein communities and law enforcement agencies were previously made aware of the danger posed by these individuals. In all of these cases, nothing was done to mitigate the potential danger. In the case of federal law enforcement, to some extent it stands to reason that organizations such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security might be less motivated to counter these threats, since these are under the control of the Obama administration, whose agenda includes destabilizing America through an influx of potentially violent Muslims and the establishment of insular Muslim communities. In a speech to the United Nations this week, our bath house refugee-playing statesman president, Barack Hussein Obama, defended increasing globalization and condemned the populist nationalism that has been growing in the West in direct response to the actions of murderous Muslim émigrés and refugees. This deportment, which has included the Obama administration illegally facilitating the importation of tens of thousands of Muslims from unstable, culturally bankrupt Islamic nations, has also given rise to such debacles as the 858 people who, according to a new Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s report, were “mistakenly” granted citizenship due to a failure of the federal government’s fingerprint records system, despite having been ordered deported. This is eerily reminiscent of the jihadi training camps known to exist across the continental U.S., but which law enforcement is prohibited from engaging because the Islamist groups operating them somewhat conveniently did not make it onto the federal government’s official list of terrorist organizations. Tragically, this international socialist-Islamist axis of Western elites even includes powerful religious leaders such as Pope Francis, who regularly condemns “hateful acts of terrorism” with one breath while admonishing Europeans to “welcome refugees into your homes and communities” (the same refugees who are rioting and raping their way across that continent) with the next. With regard to the United States, this is a component of the agenda calculated to render America irrelevant as a nation of influence on the world stage. The Islamists seek global supremacy for their foul doctrine, while the socialists harbor attitudes varying from those which hold that the concept of nations itself is outmoded, to those which characterize the U.S. as last among the old-school imperialist oppressor nations that must be dismantled. A chief stratagem of the latter is of course the idea that racism practiced by those of northern European descent has been the greatest evil of the last thousand years. Erik Rush’s book on race is bold, daring and needed — now more than ever: “Negrophilia: From Slave Block to Pedestal – America’s Racial Obsession” — just $4.95! It’s a pretty safe bet that the conservative establishment press will have no interest in that upon which your humble commentator has to say regarding these matters from this point forward, since I would start with a moratorium on Muslim immigration and the summary expulsion of each and every Muslim foreign national in the United States. I would also revoke the citizenship of each and every naturalized Muslim American and deport them to their native countries, save for giving them the opportunity to renounce Islam in order to escape this fate. These people, as well as the second and third-generation descendants of Muslim émigrés, could count on ongoing surveillance to ensure their sincerity. Here, obviously, I am dispensing with the subverted notions of constitutionality popularly advanced by the left, as well as political correctness and cultural relativism. Islam is not a religion, nor should it be considered such under law; it is a retrograde system ascribed to by barbarians whose company I would typically pass on in favor of an afternoon cavorting with a troupe of lower primates.

The Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “Conversation with Chelsea” event at Penn State University Wednesday. And look.

A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $1,000 and could get access to the reception for $2,700. Talk about a deal! So $500 bare minimum.

What kind of galactic stupidity does Obama think he’s peddling on Americans?  Islamic Jihadis are slaughtering people by the tens of thousands, they are converting “peaceful Muslims” into Jihadis, and they are winning the war against the world to impose Sharia on all peoples.  Obama says this is a battle between those who are “hijacking” a religion of peace and those who believe Islam is a religion of peace. This is the new normal for peace in our time ala Obama.  America can expect Democrats to not only import cheap labor from Mexico and South America, but import Muslims from the Middle East as refugees from Obama’s New Jihad.  As atonement for killing Sheik Osama bin Laden, Obama has armed, funded, and given American bomber support to the Muslim Brotherhood’s overthrown of Middle Eastern governments.  As he assists the New Caliphate to be reborn, Obama is squandering America’s wealth helping to fund terrorism through Iran, while at the same time inviting our enemies into our homes to make America atone for its sin of resisting Islam. Hillary Clinton has already announced her plans to continue the Obama policies.  She will make foreigners citizens and give them rights not only as Americans, but over Americans as they wish to impose Sharia law on us infidels.  If people are stupid enough to elect a Republican Congress that might deter her, she will have Executive Orders and a Supreme Court to make law as Obama has been allowed to do.  Just who are the mega-fools who believe Hillary would be the more effective counter-terrorist of her and Trump?

1352,"The preliminary numbers are in, and they suggest that the first presidential debate of 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be the most watched debate going back decades. With the first presidential debate of 2012 averaging 70 million viewers, last night is looking like a massive night for TV news. The numbers from all the channels will be made available by Nielsen over the course of the day. All told, the early numbers continue to show that 2016 just seems to keep getting better for TV news channels. And with the presidential campaign nearing its final stretch, the first forecasts are coming in for just how good the Trumped-up 2016 presidential campaign has been to them. With the 2016 election’s pivotal events delivering record ratings moments every few months (highest rated primary debate, highest rated primary election night coverage, etc), CNN and Fox News are poised to have the most-watched years in their respective histories, stretching back to 1980 for CNN and 1996 for Fox News. MSNBC has a chance to do so as well. Many networks reported that they’d “sold out” their first debate night early, and are expecting the same for the next three. Story Continued Below And that means money. According to data from media and communications data firm SNL Kagan, a division of SMP Global Market Intelligence, the three major cable news networks are set to make nearly $2 billion in ad revenues, and the three main business networks are set to add another $458 million in ad revenue from just the 2016 calendar year. “We’ve been outselling our election packages for a year now,” said Katrina Cukaj, EVP of Portfolio Sales & Client Partnerships for Turner Ad Sales, which includes CNN. “We are close to selling out for the rest of the [election related] days; there is very high demand. Very high.” Fox News is expecting a “multimillion dollar revenue night” when all the money is counted. According to the Wall Street Journal, CNN is selling debate and election night ad packages with minimums of $800,000 to $1 million, with 30 second ads for the presidential debates going for more than $55,000. Other cable news channels are selling similar bundled ad packages. And those kinds of numbers take into account that there are no ad interruptions during the debate – all those ads are sold against pre- and post-game analysis and panels. “There is considerably higher demand in this election cycle with higher price points compared to the other election cycles,” an NBC source said. According to SNL Kagan, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC will combine for approximately $1.96 billion in gross ad sales in 2016. Compare that to $1.72 million in calendar year 2015 (which saw a number of high-profile primary debates), and $1.56 million in calendar year 2012, the last presidential election year. The ad revenue makes sense when you look at the numbers. The first Republican debate in August of 2015 brought in a record-breaking 24 million viewers for Fox News. Fox News’ March debate in Detroit, Michigan averaged just under 17 million viewers. Through March and April, big primary nights would draw an average of 10-12 million viewers across cable news and on 10 p.m. broadcast specials. Those sorts of ratings are typically reserved for major sporting events like NFL games, or huge hit shows like NCIS. This election cycle has been delivering them with regularity, even if they are spread out across a number of channels. The election is also broadening the types of advertisers who are hoping to catch the eyeballs of the big election audiences. Cukaj said she’s seen an uptick in entertainment and movie advertisements. “Movie studios and entertainment has been very, very active in these big election events, they enjoy the nice big ratings these live events do,” Cukaj said. Fox News EVP of advertising sales Paul Rittenberg told AdWeek “there's substantially more demand from [advertisers] who didn't used to buy a lot of news; we even have a beer [company].” That company is Tecate, which was running a debate-specific ad about a “wall” on Fox News, Univision and Telemundo during the pre and post-debate shows. (In fact, the wall never came up in the debate.) Among the entertainment advertisers is Epix, which aired a faux-cable news segment before last night’s debate, featuring cable news regulars Michael Steele, Amy Holmes and Barney Frank. CNN had to run a gold banner over the “segment” to ensure viewers knew it was not CNN content. For the broadcast networks, the 2016 campaign has largely been a boon, even if election-related programming has occasionally competed with or preempted more lucrative entertainment and sports programming (at $200,000 per 30 second spot, the debate programming would be very similar to what standard entertainment fare would bring in). Still, this broadcast season, news programming has been one of the few bright spots, with most entertainment and sports programming seeing ratings declines compared to last year. The broadcast networks CBS and NBC are selling 30 second ads for more than $200,000 each, according to the Journal. Advertising rates for the presidential debates may not be as high as some primary debates were, as they do not have commercial breaks, so all ads run before and after the debate when the channels are doing pre- and post-debate analysis (in case you were wondering why there is so much of it, the answer is: inventory!) For the networks, that eats into valuable prime-time real estate, where entertainment programming can command higher premiums. There’s another reason debates like the one last night aren’t quite as valuable as they could be: Scarcity, or lack thereof. With the debate airing on more than 10 TV channels, and streaming on hundreds of websites, the audience will be massive, but highly fragmented. In fact, despite the massive 2016 haul, the picture for television news continues to be bleak. For one thing, news networks these days are making less than half their money from advertising, so ""big years"" don't have nearly the lasting effect they might otherwise. Where does the rest of their revenue come from? For big networks like CNN, a lot of it comes from “carriage fees” – the lucrative contracts the big news networks sign with cable providers like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications in return for allowing their channel to appear on the carriers’ channel line-ups. These deals – which can be contentious and result in channel blackouts with individual providers but usually, ultimately go the TV networks' way – are often negotiated in multi-year terms. Time Warner CFO Howard Averill said that next year, 2017, will deliver record profits for CNN, beating 2016 despite this year’s election boost. Previously negotiated carriage fee increases guarantee that result, even if the channel sees a steep ratings decline. And that’s just one place where the connection between audience size and revenue is deteriorating. In fact, while 2016 may top the revenue charts, the three big cable news networks have actually been on the rebound since 2013, with all three increasing ad revenue every year since then. These good signs are generally taken with a grain of salt behind the closed doors of the TV businesses’ executive suites. The chief worries: Television audiences are aging out of the TV news ecosystem, and not being replaced by younger viewers coveted by advertisers. Over time, this will also depress audience numbers, as those aging viewers are replaced by fewer young viewers growing into engagement with TV news. And indeed, not everyone has shared in the big bounty of 2016. Local ad revenue, which relies heavily on political spending, has not been as strong as anticipated. SNL Kagan downgraded their projected income of $3.3 billion for local television down to $3.1 billion partly as a result of Trump not spending as much on advertising. Sinclair Broadcasting, the country’s largest owner of TV stations, warned investors last week that 2016 political ad spending was falling short of expectations. Ironically, the presence of Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign, often discussed as if it were the reason this election is such a television draw, is a factor in that slump. “While we previously anticipated a decline in presidential ad spending in the third quarter based on the late fund-raising by the Trump campaign, we have yet to see significant spending, even at the levels we initially anticipated,” Sinclair CFO Chris Ripley said at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. CBS CEO Les Moonves told attendees at the same conference that his local station revenue was on track, but much of that was coming in from local and statewide races and issue campaigns. As far as the presidential campaign, there was one big reason Moonves pointed to to describe the unexpected slump: “To generalize, [there is not as much spending from] the top of the tickets, because Mr. Trump does not appear to be spending as much as people thought.” — Additional reporting by Kelsey Sutton",1,0,0
699,"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: A shooter opened fire at the Cascade Mall on Friday night, killing five people and fleeing the scene of the crime. Dozens of police officers are currently searching for the gunman, described as a Hispanic man in his 20s or 30s. Authorities believe the man acted alone, though it’s possible that he received help, a spokesperson for the patrol, Sgt. Mark Francis, said in a midnight briefing outside the mall. “I’d be extremely diligent and careful if you come in contact with the suspect,” Francis warned. “Stay indoors, stay secure.” The shooter killed four women in the cosmetics department of a Macy’s department store at the Burlington shopping center, which is located 65 miles north of Seattle. Another man suffered critical injuries but passed away Saturday morning, Sgt. Francis said on Twitter. The gunman, armed with a long hunting rifle, left before police arrived. The mall was quickly evacuated around 8pm, minutes after the shooting took place. There has been no indication that the event was terror-related, Washington State Trooper spokeswoman Heather Axtman told NBC News, adding that the motive remains unclear. “We’re still trying to gather as many witnesses as we can to get more information,” she said. Eric Mathews, 40, intended to meet his teenage son Kai at the mall on Friday night, arriving just as the shooting occurred. The two left before the mall was locked down, but four of Kai’s friends were stuck inside. “Imagine I was late or if he didn’t answer his phone,” Mathews told the NY Times, referring to his son. “That stuff is running through my mind.” Tari Caswell was in the Macy’s women’s dressing room when she heard the shots, “like four balloons popping,” she told the Skagit Valley Herald. “Then I heard seven or eight more, and I just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn’t feel right. And it got very quiet,” she added. The investigation is ongoing, and the FBI has said early Saturday morning that it had “no information to suggest that additional attacks,” were planned in Washington state. This is the second attack at a U.S. shopping mall in less than a week. Last Saturday an assailant stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minn. before an off-duty police officer intervened.

166,"A senior member of the CongressionalÂ Black Caucus stepped up to a lectern on the House Floor on Thursday and listed all the innocent activities that can be a death sentence for African-Americans. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), armed with a variety of props, depicted all the things that can cause black people in the United States to be killed at the hands of law enforcement because they are viewed with suspicion,Â even when engaging in harmless activities. âEach time we lose a precious life to fear, distress, and prejudice, the list of things that will get you killed as a black person in America gets a little longer,â Lee said. Among the items she held up were: âShould any of this warrant a death sentence? Is this the America you want to live in?â Lee asked. Lee said that when her sons were young she had âtough conversationsâ with them, warning them to be careful in their interactions with the very same police officers who are sworn to serve and protect them. âSince Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson two years ago, 2,195 people have been killed by police in our nation. As the mother of two black men and the grandmother of five black grandchildren, I worry that someone I love could become number 2,196,â she said. The issue of fatal police shootings of African-Americans has come to the forefront again after three more killings rocked the nation.Â Tyre King, a teenager with a BB gun, was killed in Columbus, Ohio; Terence Crutcher, who had his hands in the air, was killed in Tulsa, Okla.; and Keith Lamont Scott, who was reading a book in his car, was killed in Charlotte, N.C.

44,"As Donald Trump courted African-American voters in Cleveland on Wednesday at a town hall taped by Fox News to air Thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level. When asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump responded, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" He added, ""New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.""       The law enforcement policy — in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations — has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump's. Trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism. He has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life. On Tuesday night, Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever"" — seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement. On Thursday morning, however, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally. ""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said. His initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention Chicago, though Trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is ""out of control."" Of course, as president, Trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement. During a press conference, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were asked about Trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous, and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York. ""We would ask Donald Trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York.",1,0,0

The vice president slammed the Manhattan billionaire for bragging, as he did Monday night, about not paying federal income taxes, suggesting that such a message did not resonate with hard-working, middle-class Americans. The vice president’s harshest criticism of Trump concerned the real estate mogul’s past statement that the 2007 crash in America’s housing market was good for his business. Of such comments, Biden rhetorically asked the crowd “what in hell is he talking about?” “Look, I’ve been there for eight presidents, Democrat and Republican, I’ve disagreed and agreed. But every president I have served with, including the Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American,” the vice president said. “Can you imagine Ronald Reagan, the most conservative president we’ve had in a long time, can you imagine him saying, ‘it’s good business to take advantage of people’s misery,’ rooting for that misery? I really mean this. I am not joking. I am not kidding. What does it say about this man?” Biden acknowledged Clinton’s struggles to gain traction with young voters, who polls show are dissatisfied with both major party candidates and have thus gravitated to third-party options like Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. But Hillary Clinton is in lock step with the majority of young people, Biden said, on issues like marriage equality, abortion rights, and reducing the cost of college education. The vice president also told the crowd that he’s spent a significant amount of time throughout this election cycle answering questions from foreign leaders nervous that Trump might win the White House. He said he’s had to reassure leaders from the Baltic states concerned that the GOP nominee might back out of America’s NATO commitments and Australian leaders worried that China’s influence in the Western Pacific might grow under Trump. “Look last night, you got a good look at both the candidates, you saw them both. Hillary demonstrated she’s a leader, she has courage, she cares about the circumstances of the American people, not just the super wealthy,” Biden said. “She thinks everybody should pay their fair share. We simply can’t elect a man who belittles our closest allies, embraces dictators like Putin, a man who seeks to sow division for his own gain and his own benefit, a man who considers bluster and confuses that with strength.”",1,0,0
272,"New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals. Both Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks. The ""Jon Stewart of Egypt"" takes on Donald Trump Clinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. While the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday. Trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader. ""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over."" He later said, ""I've already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones. Clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president. Clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi. While reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."" Trump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting. ""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said. The Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added. The campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East."" Sisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month. Sitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts."" Clinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House. ""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins."" The meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady. Trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto earlier this year. The meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Peña Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it. Clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's ""embarrassing international incident."" ""When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting. For her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials. Instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points. Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. Clinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself. Currently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians. Clinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration. Clinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS."" Clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country. Clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace. Sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally. ""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said. Trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished. Clinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path. Clinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected. There is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.

1152,"North Carolina Republicans are lamenting the unrest gripping their state’s largest city, but, quietly, they also see it as an opportunity for Donald Trump to gain ground in a critical swing state. And they’re asking him to take advantage of it. Story Continued Below “North Carolina Republicans are sending the word to the Trump campaign that once this settles down, a visit to Charlotte, to the Mecklenburg police, to the sheriff and others, is something we really want to see,” said a high-ranking North Carolina Republican, granted anonymity to discuss political calculations during a sensitive moment for the state. “Lawmakers and party officials are sending word to the Trump campaign.” The crisis in Charlotte was sparked by the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man who police say was armed, though no video has been released and the family disputes that claim. Since then, the city has been the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters, with the clashes captured on live, national television. The tumult comes as Hillary Clinton’s once-formidable lead in state polls has faded. A spate of polls out this week show either a tied race or give Trump a slight edge—a sharp contrast from last month, when Clinton was leading by anywhere from 2 to 9 percentage points. North Carolina political operatives are skeptical that, unless the chaos in Charlotte continues for weeks, the issue will make a substantial dent in the race. But Republicans and some Democrats do say that the dynamic creates an opening for Trump to further shore up and energize the GOP base—something he has struggled to do—predicting voters will respond to his campaign’s law-and-order message and his staunch defense of police, even amid national concerns over institutional police racism. A senior adviser to the Trump campaign said only that Trump had been in the state earlier this week and ""we have not yet announced the date of our next trip back to the state."" “I certainly think unrest feeds into Trump’s narrative that ‘America’s falling apart, we need to make America great again,’” said Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster whose firm is based in North Carolina. “My sense is, most white North Carolinians who would be really repulsed by what’s going on in Charlotte would be in Trump’s camp. I doubt it moves the needle a lot, but the race is just about tied … something like that is never going to move the race by 3 or 4 points, but it can change the race on the margins, and we’re on the margins.” Thus far, Clinton has largely stuck to tweeting in support of Scott, rather than commenting on the Wednesday night protests. And Trump was vague in a Fox News appearance Thursday morning, lamenting the “lack of spirit between the white and the black,” and going on to assert that amid the chaos “our country looks bad to the world” in a speech later in the day. But moving the needle even a little may be enough in a state where the polls are tight and there’s a history of thin margins. North Carolina, a typically red state that went for Barack Obama in 2008 before swinging back to support Mitt Romney in 2012, is central to Trump’s path to victory, which is narrower than Clinton’s is. Clinton’s summer leads in the state were fueled by support from African-American and college-educated voters in a state that is home to the Research Triangle, the Raleigh-Durham area where universities and high-tech companies are based. But in North Carolina, as in a number of other swing states, her lead has diminished amid scrutiny of her email practices, her health and her overall commitment to transparency. And the protests, Republicans say, may mean more trouble, especially if there are additional nights of strife. “Every time there is a riot, protest, or general disruption of civility it helps Donald Trump,” said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who was the director of data, analytics and digital strategy on Ted Cruz’s primary campaign. The Cruz primary campaign had firsthand experience with this: Protests at a Chicago Trump rally ahead of the March 15 primaries—when a list of states that included North Carolina voted—dominated the weekend coverage before those races. Wilson said the net effect was boosting Trump across the board in the final days before the Republican contests (though representatives from Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign, also watching their own internal numbers, have said they didn’t see the same effect). “We certainly saw this in the primaries as the riots [in] Chicago, prior to a scheduled Trump speech, created a significant lift for Trump’s candidacy,” Wilson said. “Not just in Illinois, but also in Missouri and North Carolina.” The unrest also carries risks for Trump, as the charged racial questions surrounding the issue heighten the possibility of a misstatement, one that could undo a recent effort to fight charges that he’s a racist candidate. That is a risk for the bombastic Trump, who has a record of horrifying moderate voters in the wake of tragedies (“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,” he tweeted, following a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, though he said he didn’t want the “congrats”). And the Charlotte situation carries opportunities for Clinton as well. African-Americans, a crucial part of her base, have been outraged by the shooting, the latest instance of a black man dying in an altercation with police (in this instance, the police officer involved was also African-American). Clinton has been a champion of “Mothers of the Movement,” a group of African-American mothers whose children died primarily in incidents involving law enforcement, and she is a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform. In North Carolina and nationally, her campaign is engaged in extensive outreach to the African-American community. A senior Democratic operative working in North Carolina said the incidents unfolding in Charlotte underscore the risks African-Americans see in a potential President Trump. “It is further alienation, a further concern among African-American voters about Trump’s presidency,” the source said, noting that Trump has a long record of making incendiary comments about minorities. The strategist said Trump’s best-case scenario, politically, is that calls for law and order help him solidify his base—but that doesn’t move the dial with independent and more moderate voters, the source insisted. “I think Donald Trump continues to solidify his 43 percent of the vote, he’s not adding votes, he’s certainly alienating others,” the Democrat said, going on to add, “It just confirms to his base all the things they’re concerned about are real. But shoring up 43 percent of the vote you have is not the way to get to 50.” And Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist, said it is not a given that Trump’s standing will rise on the other side of the aisle just because of the protests. “If you’re living in North Carolina, you turn on the TV and there’s riots in Charlotte, there’s looting, it gets your attention, but it doesn’t automatically help one candidate over another,” he said. “It depends on how the individual candidate responds. People will watch that. If they think, ‘Gosh, Trump’s got a lot of judgment, he knows how to solve this,' it will help him. If they think, ‘Old Trump just poured gas on the fire,’ it won’t help him at all.”",1,0,0
28,"A ""journal"" belonging to New York City bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami has been recovered by authorities, two federal officials told ABC News. The writings were apparently on Rahami when he allegedly engaged in a firefight with police, and the pages were shot through with a bullet. The officials said that in them, Rahami refers to the late American al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whose sermons and writings have been linked to a number of terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S.     A federal complaint filed against Rahami late Tuesday said that in the journal, he also praised Nidal Hasan, the 2009 Fort Hood shooter, and al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. ""You (USA Government) continue your [unintelligible] slaught[er] against the mujahidean [Islamic warriors] be it Afghanistan, Iraq, Sham [Syria], Palestine..."" part of the journal reads, according to the complaint. ""[God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION."" Investigators have also seized ""a lot of papers"" at a home linked to Rahami, a source told ABC News. As of late Monday, authorities had not determined a motive for Rahami, who has been linked to bombings over the weekend in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea and in New Jersey. Though two of the explosives were housed in pressure cookers, as was the case in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the officials said there was no mention in Rahami's purported writings of the perpetrators of that attack, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Today officials said they're also investigating a possible link to five unexploded pipe bombs recovered in Elizabeth, N.J. Rahami has been charged with attempted murder related to the shootout with police just before he was apprehended Monday.

59,"The bodies of 162 people had been pulled from the waters off the Egyptian coast by Friday, two days after a boat carrying hundreds of migrants capsized in the Mediterranean while attempting to head to Europe. Dozens more are feared dead, said Mohammed Sultan, the governor of Beheira, who provided The Associated Press with the latest figures. He also said that the search operation is still ongoing. Many of them are believed to be children and women who were unable to swim away when the boat sank. Wahdan el-Sayyed, the spokesman of the Nile Delta province of Beheira, told The Associated Press that the search operation was ongoing. An AP reporter near the Nile Delta city of Rosetta saw between 20 to 30 bodies brought in by coast guards in gray inflatable boats and fishermen in wooden boats early Friday morning and delivered to ambulances at the coast guard pier. Pictures posted on social networking sites showed dozens of bodies lined up in black plastic bags, and others floating near wooden fishing boats. Videos showed that some fishermen were using nets to bring up the bodies. In one video, a fisherman was heard shouting into his mobile phone that, ""the sea is littered with bodies."" Many of those gathered at the shore where the bodies arrived appeared to be wearing surgical masks to protect them from the smell of decaying bodies. Some brought chunks of ice to be placed on the bodies to prevent them from decomposing. Authorities have struggled to give accurate figures for the number of people on board the capsized vessel. The U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR, estimated that the boat was packed with some 450 people, while the state news agency MENA said earlier that the number might be as high as 600. The boat was located nearly 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the Nile Delta port city of Rosetta when it sank. It had waited at sea for many hours — perhaps days — for smaller wooden boats carrying migrants to arrive from different points along the Egyptian coastline. Survivors said that overcrowding caused the boat to capsize. Egyptian officials said that over 160 people were rescued and that the majority are Egyptians, while the others are Sudanese and other nationalities, including Somalians and Eritreans. The head of the local council in the area, Ali Abdel-Sattar, said that the currents have carried the bodies of the victims many kilometers away from the site of the sinking. ""Today, four bodies, including two Egyptian children, were found 20 kilometers to the east,"" he told the AP. He added that many of the migrants are believed to have been ""stored in the bottom of the boat, in the fridge."" ""Those are the ones who drowned first, most probably stuck, and their bodies might not be retrieved anytime soon,"" he said, adding, ""those we found are the ones liberated from the boat. I believe many are stuck and now laying in the bottom of the sea."" He said the boat may now have sunk to 16 meters (yards) below sea level. The EU border agency, Frontex, recently said more than 12,000 migrants arrived in Italy from Egypt between January and September this year, compared to 7,000 in the same period last year. Yet UNHCR says that since 2014 there has been a steady increase in the number of people intercepted while trying to leave Egypt, with 4,600 people arrested this year, a 28-percent increase compared to the previous year. On Thursday, four people described as members of the vessel's crew were arrested over charges of human trafficking and manslaughter. At a small pier called el-Borg, hundreds of families had gathered Friday, hoping to identify the bodies of their loved ones. Women screamed and relatives pushed and shoved while swarming the ambulances heading to the hospital. Fishermen said that they had difficulty collecting the badly decomposed bodies, with one saying, ""we didn't know how to pull them out."" Survivors and relatives told the AP earlier that the boat sank around 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and that it took coast guards around six hours to come to the rescue. Fishing boats in the vicinity were the first to provide help. ""I have never seen such a large number of people drowning in the waters as I saw that day,"" a 42-year-old fisherman told AP. He said he arrived at 11 a.m. in the morning and helped the survivors. ""We threw the ropes, we pulled them in, and many were unconscious. The strong majority are youngsters,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of security fears. Many of the survivors were briefly detained by police. Some of those rescued were taken to hospitals, where they lay handcuffed to beds and under police guard. The Egyptian news portal, Al-Youm al-Sabei, published interviews with several survivors who said that before their journey the migrants had been ""stored"" for several days in chicken farms by the traffickers to evade police. Some of the interviewees said the traffickers asked for $6250 per family, to be given on arrival in Italy. After his release, survivor Ahmed Darwish said, ""my advice is that no one should undertake this risk, and especially anyone who saw these things, they will never do it again."" The International Organization for Migration has said that this year over 3,500 have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, with this number ""rapidly approaching"" the record death toll set last year. Those who chose to risk the dangerous journey are often fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere. ——— Michael contributed to this story from Cairo, Egypt",1,0,0
764,"You can’t make this stuff up. We live in an age where there’s an Islamist attack – and the media rushes to make sure that Muslims are OK. The very same people who are all too happy to call for gun control and demonize law abiding gun owners following a mass shooting will do everything they can to protect the sensibilities of Muslims following an Islamist attack. Yes, guns are misused, and Islam has its radicals, but radical Islam is much more damaging than guns ever could be. According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 10 percent of Muslims globally hold what we would deem “extremist” views (those who would condone violence against non-Muslims). If ten percent of gun owners were “extremists,” there wouldn’t be any people left! On Saturday there were two bombings, one in NJ and another in NY. Today we found out that the killer was a radical Muslim (shocking!). Another stabbing attack was carried out in Minnessota – whereas nine were injured but none killed. The attacker was shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Now police are warning about attacks…… against Muslims. As the Gateway Pundit reported: On Saturday Islamist Dahir Adan went on a stabbing rampage at Crossroads Mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Adan was screaming, “Allahu Akbar!” during the attack.

977,"MASON CITY, Iowa — Hillary Clinton’s statement that Donald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric aids ISIL’s cause is a “new low” for the Clinton campaign, Mike Pence said on Monday. “The campaign of insults went to a new low this morning,” Pence said of Clinton’s campaign. “Hillary Clinton actually said my running mate’s rhetoric had been ‘seized on by terrorists.’ … And she said Donald Trump’s rhetoric was ‘giving comfort to our adversaries.’” Story Continued Below “Well, Hillary, strength does not give comfort to our adversaries, weakness does,” Pence said. Pence was referring to comments Clinton made Monday in response to attacks in Minnesota, New York and New Jersey. ""We know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS, because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam rather than a war against jihadists,"" she told reporters during a statement Clinton has made this claim multiple times during the campaign. When she first leveled the charge in December, Politifact said there was no evidence for it. But after ISIL used a clip of Trump in a video after the group's attack on Brussels, Politifact updated its assessment, calling the claim true. Pence's comments came on the heels of a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh in which Pence said Clinton is oblivious to the threats posed by terrorism and complicit in weakening U.S. law enforcement. “I’m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know that we’re at war,” Pence said. He went on to blame Democrats for a “culture of political correctness that is tying the hands of law enforcement here at home.” Pence spoke to Limbaugh on the phone from his plane on the tarmac in Mason City, Iowa, where he's appearing at a town hall event ahead of a rally in Dubuque. He also slammed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest for suggesting that the US and ISIL are engaged in a “narrative fight” and took issue with Clinton’s statement earlier Monday that Donald Trump’s fiery rhetoric aids ISIL. “The only thing that gives comfort to our adversaries is weakness,” Pence said. The Saturday explosions in New Jersey and New York appear to be unrelated to the Minnesota attack, officials say. The Minnesota assailant stabbed nine people before being killed by police. ISIL has taken responsibility for the attack. The Saturday night bombing in New York wounded 29 people, while the earlier explosion in New Jersey before a charity race caused no injuries. An Afghan immigrant believed to be tied to the bombings was arrested in New Jersey on Monday after a gunfight with police. “We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,” Pence told Limbaugh. “We are at war with the ISIS caliphate.”",1,0,0

They never know if it will be their last. They have sworn an oath that all lives matter and they will protect people from those that are criminally inclined and evil. There are very few ‘bad’ cops and they are usually weeded out. The majority of officers are those who joined to help others and keep them from harm. You have about as much chance of being struck by lightning as you do being shot by a police officer. You really have to work at it to become a statistic. Those that are shot almost without fail are threatening police officers or not obeying commands. The statistics tell the story if anyone bothers to review them. Violence is out of control in the black community and overwhelmingly when a person is shot, it is justified. And it happens very rarely.    ",0,0,1
351,"Toledo, Ohio (CNN)Donald Trump wants to take the controversial policy of stop-and-frisk to Chicago. Trump touted the much-maligned program during a Fox News town hall that was pre-taped for Wednesday night but didn't air, responding to a question about how he would stem ""violence in the black community."" He clarified on ""Fox and Friends"" Thursday morning that he was specifically proposing expanding the program only to Chicago, highlighting the city's gun violence epidemic and comparing the situation to New York in the 1990s. ""(Former NYPD Commissioner) Ray Kelly did a great job and New York was not in a Chicago situation, but it was really in trouble. It was in bad shape, crime wise, with all the shootings and everything,"" he said. ""And it really -- Rudy Giuliani did a great job as mayor, and they really straightened things out with stop-and-frisk and it was used further by the next mayor, Bloomberg, and now they just recently -- not so recently, but fairly recently -- they stopped it."" Under stop and frisk, police stop people on the street who they deem suspicious and think may be involved in criminal activity and search them on the spot for guns and illegal drugs, among other things. Trump said the program worked and that it could impact gun violence in Chicago. ""Now Chicago is out of control. I was really referring to Chicago stop and frisk. They asked me about Chicago. And I was talking about stop and frisk for Chicago,"" he said. Trump had praised the practice -- which a federal judge ruled in New York in 2013 was unconstitutional, and unlawfully targeted blacks and Latinos, although it was not banned outright -- in similar terms at the town hall Wednesday night. ""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,"" Trump said in response to an audience member's question. Trump has previously touted stop-and-frisk policies, but his full-throated endorsement of it Wednesday -- in which he called for its widespread implementation -- came as Trump pressed forward with his pitch to African-American voters, appearing at a predominantly black church alongside several of his prominent black surrogates. New York mayor: Donald Trump wrong about 'stop-and-frisk' That pitch to African-Americans hasn't come without a series of slip-ups, the latest of which came as Trump invited the prominent boxing promoter Don King, who is black, to introduce him at the church event -- only to have the celebrity use the N-word at the podium. And on Tuesday, Trump described the state of African-American communities as being in ""absolutely the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever."" and comparing the US's inner cities to Afghanistan. While Trump has pledged to bring jobs and safety to the inner cities, he has offered few specifics as to how he would address those issues. But Trump has called for beefing up the number of police officers in inner cities and argued that police officers need more latitude to do their jobs and backing from political figures -- a push not necessarily consistent with African-Americans' frustrations over the spate of police shootings against unarmed black men, which have rocked the country. ""You have to have, in my opinion -- I see what's going on here, I see what's going on in Chicago -- I think stop-and-frisk. In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked. Now, we had a very good mayor, but New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do,"" Trump said Wednesday. The real estate mogul's call for introducing stop-and-frisk as a prescription for reducing ""black-on-black crime"" -- as the questioner put it in the town hall -- is also likely to face a stiff rebuke from minority leaders. Many have opposed the practice during its use by New York City police as minorities were disproportionally targeted. In August 2013 a federal judge ruled that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities in New York. She didn't order an outright ban, but called for reform of the policy and outside oversight. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. ""The United States Constitution guarantees the rights of all Americans, and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York already ruled in 2013 that stop-and-frisk, as previously practiced in New York, was unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. ""These policies erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. Plus, they have proven to be ineffective."" A November 2013 report from the New York attorney general revealed just 3% of stop-and-frisk stops led to convictions between 2009 and 2012. And in more than 5 million stops between 2002 and 2013, police recovered guns less than 0.02% of the time, according to police department data compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union in a 2014 report. Stop-and-frisk was instituted by one of Trump's most prominent supporters and advisers, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani has continued to defend the practice in recent years, rebutting the statistics showing little correlation between stop-and-frisk and a reduction in crime. Giuliani frequently joins Trump on the campaign trail -- where he is introduced as ""America's mayor"" -- and argues that Trump will bring the same tough-on-crime approach to the presidency. Trump recently praised the stop-and-frisk policy in an interview earlier this month in Philadelphia where he was asked about the African-American communities' concerns that stop-and-frisk amounts to racial profiling. ""Well, I think you are going to have it. So many people are being killed in Philadelphia, that it's actually incredible when you look at the stats. I think you have to have it,"" he said in an interview with the local NBC station. Trump pressed forward with his pitch to African-American voters Wednesday afternoon during a rally in Toledo, Ohio -- where he again described black lives in the US in bleak terms. ""To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it -- and I say, honestly, what do you have to lose? It's not gonna get any worse. It's terrible. The crime, the bad education, the no jobs. What do you have to lose? Believe me, I will fix it. I'm gonna fix it,"" Trump said. But New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the belief that stop-and-frisk caused the city's crime rate to plummet is false. ""I understand that people say that, (but) that's just not the history,"" he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" The mayor said it was former New York City Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton promoting community policing in 1994 that led to the decrease of crime in the city. ""That's what changed things in New York City,"" de Blasio said. ""The bottom line is it (stop-and-frisk) created a huge line of division between police and communities."" ""We ended that unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk, that overuse of stop-and-frisk,"" he added. De Blasio said that crime has actually decreased since the city all but ended stop-and-frisk three years ago. And that Trump's facts on policing are inaccurate and would reverse the progress that the city has made, the mayor said. ""Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts,"" he said. ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety."" ""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" de Blasio added. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated whether New York City is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process. CNN's Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",1,0,0

But the optimistic outlook has collided with reality over the last few days.

It depends on what level she hits you with, if she’s fair, if it’s unfair, but certainly I’m not looking to do that.” His view of Lester Holt: “Lester is a professional, but we’ll see what happens … By the way, Lester is a Democrat.

Hillary is nearly certain to win 16 ‘ blue' states, including Washington D.C., which will garner her 191 electoral votes,” writes Mook in the nearly 2,000-word memo that was blasted out [to donors, supporters and volunteers] in the early evening, and which was obtained by POLITICO. ‘If we add the five states that FiveThirtyEight.com gives Hillary a 70% or greater chance of winning (Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin), Hillary only needs 10 more electoral votes.’ ... “‘Put a different way, of these battleground states, Hillary can win just one (Florida, Ohio, or North Carolina) and win the presidency, which means the six additional states would only add more electoral votes to her total,” he writes. “Donald Trump, on the other hand, must win six of these seven states, including Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio — none of which he can lose.’” http://politi.co/2cjjFVC ADELSON PONIES UP -- “Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOP,” by CNN’s Teddy Schleifer: “The billionaire on Tuesday will disclose having given $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to George W.

A check of a similar size is expected to go to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a similar super PAC focused on the House of Representatives. And to back Trump, a donation of at least $5 million is likely headed to the political operation helmed by the Ricketts family, who are expected to finally spend their fortunes on Trump as well.

FOR HRC -- FROM DARREN SAMUELSOHN: “[Former President George H.W.] Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. ‘That’s what he said,’ she told POLITICO. “Asked about Townsend’s [Facebook] post, George H.W.

18,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s party has won national parliamentary elections with a significantly increased majority, a result that cements Putin's total control over the country's political life and which potentially grants him the ability to change Russia's constitution. With 93% of the vote counted, the party, United Russia, was shown to have taken 343 of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament, a sizable increase on its previous 238 seats. The vote was marked by an exceptionally low turnout of just 40 percent, illustrating a sense among many Russians that the election was of little importance in a country where the Kremlin determines all major policy decisions and elections are seen as stage-managed.   Russia’s Communist Party came a close third, while the anti-Putin opposition failed to break the 5% barrier to enter parliament, losing its only lawmaker there. The win gives United Russia a two-thirds majority that allows it to amend the constitution. United Russia's head, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev declared victory and Putin congratulated the party, saying it showed ""political maturity"" among Russians. The outcome was not surprising. With the country strongly behind Putin -- whose approval ratings stand around 80 percent -- and the opposition effectively sidelined, the vote had been described by some observers as the “dullest” election in Russian history. The only surprise was the scale of United Russia's win, overcoming polls suggesting it would have a poor showing. That was in stark contrast to the last time Russians voted for their parliament in 2011, when significant vote-rigging prompted huge street protests. Tens of thousands marched in Moscow demanding Putin’s resignation in what was the biggest popular challenge to his rule that the Russian leader has faced. Such upheavals seem now all but impossible, underlining the vivid shift in Russia’s political atmosphere since then. Eager to avoid a repeat of 2011’s trouble, this time the Kremlin has sought to create an impression that the vote would be clean. It removed the head of Russia’s elections commission -- pejoratively nicknamed the “wizard” for his ability to make the numbers add up in Putin’s favor, and replacing him with a respected human rights defender. Confident the country’s beleaguered opposition was without traction among the public, authorities had also opened up a small breathing space for them during the elections allowing them to field more candidates and to take part in TV debates. Those moves led many to predict the elections would not see significant amounts of voting fraud. With popular sentiment aggressively pro-Putin and most Russians convinced of the impossibility of political change, there appeared little need for vote rigging. How true that was was still being debated on Monday. Following the vote across Russia's 11 time zones, it was clear that the vote had been far from pristine, with growing reports of cheating and numerous videos appearing to show ballot-stuffing, but there were few claims that the violations had had any decisive impact. While threatening to annul some results where cheating was recorded, the head of Russia’s elections commission, Ella Pamfilova, said was sure the vote had been legitimate, the TASS state news agency reported. Although the vote may prove to be cleaner than in the past, critics said it was not fairer. Under Putin, the Kremlin has neutered Russia’s political debates, creating a pseudo-opposition and marginalizing actual opponents by jailing or blocking them from running, largely barring them from television, and harassing their campaigns. The parliament itself has become a rubber-stamping body, directed on how to act on most issues by the Kremlin and offering no opposition on major decisions. Before today the unauthorized opposition, the so-called “nonsystem opposition”, had only one lawmaker in the parliament, and its leaders and activists have been continuously harassed and occasionally physically attacked. This year, as part of the experiment to lend greater legitimacy to the elections, anti-Putin parties were given greater leeway. That step, however, seemed to reflect the Kremlin’s confidence in its position rather than any newfound political liberalism. With the country wrapped in nationalist sentiment following Crimea’s annexation and intensified repression of dissent, there is virtually no desire for major political change. Yabloko and Parnas, the two leading parties running on anti-Putin platforms, both failed to get above the 5%, with the early results suggesting that Russia's parliament would now not have a single openly anti-Putin lawmaker in parliament. With the final result never in doubt, there was a sensation of the system going through the motions and the majority of Russians appeared to opt out of the vote, viewing it as of little relevance. Many Russians said they can’t remember a more lackluster election run. Even the Kremlin official tasked with managing the vote, Vladimir Volodin, has described United Russia’s campaign as “sterile”, telling the business paper RBC that he believed the tactic was not to produce enthusiasm for the party but just to bring off a technically irreproachable campaign. The apathy was reflected in a record low turnout, at 40.37% the lowest since Putin took power in 2000 and 20% lower than in the contested election in 2012. In Moscow, the turnout was just 33%. In the days prior to voting, a startling number of Russians were not even aware the elections were happening. The sharp drop in participation compared with 2011, suggested that Russians' beliefs in what was politically possible in the country had narrowed considerably. At polling stations in Moscow on Sunday, many voters said they expected the vote to be cleaner than in previous years, though few expected it would be totally without fraud. Many, even those voting for the ruling party, were ambivalent about whether the vote showed Russia had democracy. Asked whether he felt Russia was democratic, one man pulled face and made a half-and-half gesture with his hand. “Does Russia have democracy?,” Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich, 63, said before voting. “Maybe. Probably we have some kind of democracy. I don’t know, I haven’t seen any other kind.” Others were more definite, saying that although they did not believe they had full-fledged democracy, it was important to vote to keep what elements of it still exist in Russia. “At the very least, it opposes the trend of authoritarianism that has appeared in Russia recently,” Lev Karakhan, a television producer accompanied by his children said after voting.",1,0,0
175,"Fake Fox News journalist Sean Hannity might be one of the golden boys at Fox News Channel, but he’s definitely going in the dog house after the stunt he pulled. Along with a handful of rednecks and hicks, Hannity and other conservative figures appeared in a ridiculously bad video called “#HEARTLAND4TRUMP.” The right-wing video was released on Trump’s official YouTube page over the weekend. “One of the reasons I’m supporting Donald Trump this year is, number one, he’s gonna put originalists on the Supreme Court, people that believe in fidelity to the Constitution, separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. He’s a guy who will vet refugees to keep Americans safe,” he says in the ad. And proving once again that he’s an ill-informed hack who sucks up to anyone willing to pay him to spew their fact free crap, Hannity offered full-throated support for Trump’s luxurious border wall (not going to happen). “And of course he’s going to build that wall,” Hannity continued. “He says he’s going to have Mexico pay for it, that’s fine, as long as we secure the country. And of course, we don’t want people competing for jobs.” It seems Hannity pissed off the higher-ups when he didn’t inform them that he was making a promotional video for the Donald Trump campaign. “We were not aware of Sean Hannity participating in a promotional video, and he will not be doing anything along these lines for the remainder of the election season,” Fox told the Daily Beast when they found out. We always deride Fox News for its ludicrous “Fair and Balanced” slogan, but never before have we seen propaganda quite like Hannity’s participation in the Trump campaign. Even Fox seems shocked by how obsessed their host is with Trump. When Fox is telling its pundits to cool it on the Trump worship, you know it’s reached embarrassing levels.

1516,"During the violent protests in Charlotte, NC, a protester shot into the crowd there. He wound up shooting Justin Carr in the head. At first the media reported he had died… Justin did not die until last night – he was on life support. This morning, the police apprehended the man they think killed him… Rayquan Borum. There are those saying the police killed Justin with rubber bullets. I don’t believe that at all. Surveillance video shows Borum shooting the gun that killed Justin. Lay blame where blame is due. The shooting happened the second night of the protests in Charlotte. It was an awful, bloody scene. I don’t know why anyone would just fire into the crowd like that. It makes no sense. Someone was bound to be hit and die. Maybe the guy just didn’t care. A white man was also kicked and beaten brutally in a garage by the protesters there. So much violence over a justified shooting by a black police officer. It’s as if facts don’t matter… they just want revolution in the streets.  From The Federalist Papers Project: The several nights of chaos in Charlotte, North Carolina led to the death of a man who was present at the protests; his name was Justin Carr. He was shot on Wednesday night and and died Thursday morning. Amid the chaos, it was difficult to tell exactly what happened. All we have known up until this point was that one of the protesters fired on Carr and that his injuries led to his death. However, there are new developments out of Charlotte. Fox News has more: Rayquan Borum, 21, was charged Friday morning in shooting death of Justin Carr, who died a day after being shot during protests in Trade Street, Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Chief Kerr Putney said. Putney said surveillance footage supplied by buildings in the area helped identify the suspect. The shooting occurred Wednesday night, and Charlotte police initially said the man had died, although he survived on life support until Thursday. Witnesses gave conflicting accounts about who shot him, with some insisting they saw police gun him down with rubber bullets, while others said he was killed by a fellow protester.  Who will protest for Justin Carr? Certainly not Black Lives Matter. To them, he is a war casualty. They’ll just step over his body and riot on. There will be no marches or demands for justice for Justin. These people use others and then discard their dead bodies as they go. It’s the communist, radical way. They are now trying to lay the blame for Justin Carr’s death on the police. I don’t believe it and won’t until I see video proving it. It is far more likely it is the guy that has been arrested. My only question is did someone pay him to shoot things up?  NEW: Charlotte police chief says they've apprehended suspect in murder of Justin Carr, who was shot during protests. https://t.co/B29wwIb7wa — ABC News (@ABC) September 23, 2016      ",0,0,1
21,"The candidates are in the final stretch of the debates as the presidential campaign is on a true countdown. Some new information about the final debate was announced today, and considering the first two presidential debates of this cycle were the most viewed ever in the history of presidential debates, the third and final one could make history as well. ""I think there's going to be a lot of focus [on the debates] and they've always been a really important part of the process,"" said Peter Eyre, a senior adviser with the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent organization that sponsors the events. Watch the third presidential debate on ABC News and ABCNews.com at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 19. Here's a rundown of the debates so far and what we know about the second and third head-to-head match-ups between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  First presidential debate: Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Moderator: NBC's ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt The debate had six segments covering different subjects, as mandated by the commission. The commission had announced that Holt selected three topics -- America's direction, achieving prosperity and securing America -- to cover during the debate, but noted that they were subject to change based on news events. Vice presidential debate: Oct. 4 at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Moderator: CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano The debate was set to feature nine segments, each about 10 minutes long. The topics of the debate were not announced in advance. Tim Kaine answered the first question, as a result of a coin toss. Second presidential debate: Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Moderators: ABC News' chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper The debate was held in a town hall format, with about half the questions asked by members of the audience and the other by the moderators. Gallup was responsible for finding the audience members, who are supposed to be uncommitted voters, the commission announced. The topics of the debate were not announced in advance. Third presidential debate: Oct. 19 at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Moderator: ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace The final debate will be in the same format as the first one. The specific topics of the debate were announced today and include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president. They are subject to change based on news events.    Much like the first presidential debate, Clinton and Trump are the only two candidates who will be on stage this Sunday. Based on the CPD's average of polls from five different national polls, Clinton has 44.8 percent of the national vote, Trump has 40.8 percent, and neither Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson nor Green Party candidate Jill Stein passed the required 15 percent threshold to be included in the debate. The averages put Johnson at 7.8 percent and Green at 2.6 percent, respectively. The commission previously announced it will use five surveys -- ABC News/Washington Post, CBS/New York Times, CNN/Opinion Research Corp., Fox News and NBC/Wall Street Journal -- to make the decision. Kaine and Pence were the only two candidates who participated in the vice presidential debate.  The names of any high-profile campaign guests have not yet been announced for the town hall debate. For that town hall debate, the participating audience will be anywhere in size from a couple dozen people up to as many as 100 people, with a viewing audience of about 1,000. Polling company Gallup has been tasked with finding the audience members for the participating audience, who are expected to be uncommitted voters. In the run-up to the first presidential debate, attention was paid to some of the big names who would be in the audience off-stage. Chelsea Clinton attended the debate, a first for her this election cycle after not attending any of the Democratic primary debates. And then another familiar face was present in the front row supporting Team Clinton: Mark Cuban. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is a vocal Clinton supporter and reportedly went so far as to volunteer to play Trump in Clinton's mock debates. He has said the Clinton team never returned his email offer, but they did keep him in mind for another move.  Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the ""Humbling at Hofstra"" on Monday. It Is On !  About 1,000 people are expected in the viewing audience at each debate, and while Eyre didn’t expect there to be frequent cuts to the audience by TV cameras, there is a chance that special guests sitting near the front may be seen on TV at some point. The audience will be a mix of guests of the universities, guests of the campaigns and ""others who have made the debates possible, including sponsors, members of the media, security, etc.,"" he said.  Commission officials are tasked with picking the moderators for the debates, and while they normally announce their decisions in August, the final list was released in September this year. ""These journalists bring extensive experience to the job of moderating, and understand the importance of using expanded time periods effectively,” Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. and Michael D. McCurry, co-chairs of the nonpartisan commission, said in the statement announcing the moderators. Raddatz, who is a co-anchor of the ABC News Sunday show ""This Week,"" is the only one of the four who has been selected by the commission before. She moderated the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan in 2012. CNN's Candy Crowley was selected to moderate the town hall-style debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012. This year, that format will have two moderators: Raddatz and Cooper. Crowley was the second female debate moderator ever. The first was ABC News' Carole Simpson in 1992. ""The formats chosen for this year's debates are designed to build on the formats introduced in 2012, which focused big blocks of time on major domestic and foreign topics,” Fahrenkopf and McCurry said in the statement. “We are grateful for their willingness to moderate, and confident that the public will learn more about the candidates and the issues as a result.”  Trump spoke repeatedly about his relaxed approach to preparations ahead of the first presidential debate. That might have changed with the second debate, but not according to Trump: he denies that a town hall-style event in New Hampshire on Thursday -- complete with a timer set to the same response times required for Sunday's debate -- was practice for the main event this weekend. Kaine and Pence have both been running mock debates, with D.C. power lawyer Bob Barnett acting as Pence and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker standing in as Kaine. As for the top of their tickets, the candidates took dramatically different approaches to debate prep in keeping with their starkly different campaigns. Clinton cleared her schedule and took herself off the campaign trail for the four days before the first debate. She did intensive debate prep, which included mock debates complete with a Trump stand-in: her longtime aide Philippe Reines, whom Clinton has called ""loyal, passionate and shrewd."" She also reviewed Trump's performance in Republican primary debates, according to campaign sources. By contrast, Trump had two campaign events scheduled days before the first debate on Sept. 26. His debate prep was slim and he did not delve into policy or participated in mock debates, sources have told ABC News. The one study tactic that they both shared was a review of their opponent's past performances. But while aides say Clinton actively reviewed Trump's work, senior level Trump sources said he was given an iPad loaded with footage of old Clinton debates, though it's unclear how much time he spent watching them. Trump was reportedly being advised by his senior campaign staff, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and campaign CEO Stephen Bannon, as well as former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who has worked on the campaigns of Presidents George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in the past. Well-known Washington lawyer Bob Barnett was said to be advising Clinton during her debate prep. He helped her prepare for the primary debates by playing Sen. Bernie Sanders. The campaign reportedly found someone to play Trump in their mock debates but they were tight-lipped about the person's identity. Trump didn’t speak extensively about his debate prep, but talked about the tone he expected to take. ""I'm going to be very respectful of her,"" Trump said during a phone interview on Fox News before the first debate, referring to Clinton. ""I think she deserves that and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me, that’ll be nice. We'll have something that I think people will respect as a debate but we'll see where it all goes. You really never know exactly how it's going to turn out and that's why we’re going to have a lot of people watching,"" Trump said. ABC News' Liz Kreutz, John Santucci, Candace Smith and Ryan Struyk contributed to this report. Watch FULL LIVE COVERAGE of the third presidential debate at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 19.

1396,"Here’s the thing: one does not have to love America. This is a free country and if one feels the need to disrespect this nation, there are not – nor should there be – legal consequences.   However, let’s be very clear: there is no law that mandates that people should be able to say whatever they want, whenever they want and remain free from encountering consequences. If I told my boss to shove it, it would be wrong for me to end up in jail for the supposed crime. However, is it not fair that I should be fired or otherwise demoted or reprimanded? Similarly, the NFL has the authority to punish the ingrates who refuse to stand for the national anthem. They have chosen not to and thus, many are choosing to boycott the NFL, including this author. Others are making consequences clear: as several Miami Dolphin players continue to demonstrate their hatred for the country that affords them the opportunity to make millions upon millions of dollars doing what they love, a police union in Miami has weighed in and asked Sheriff deputies to not perform security details for the players anymore until such a time that they begin to show a little gratitude towards this nation. Jeffery Bell, the president of the International Union of Police Associations, Local 6020, said: “We’ve asked the deputies and the Broward Sheriff’s Office not to do the details anymore.” The union has asked police units to stop providing protection for the players at a time when fans and former fans have begun to vent their outrage towards the players. Some have even taken to burning Dolphins gear. “I respect their right to have freedom of speech. However, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech temporary while you serve that job or while you play in an NFL game,” Bell said. If these ingrates are so convinced that blacks are being persecuted by police – a central premise in the platform of Black Lives Matter – then they should not receive the benefit that these supposed bigots afford.

1591,"Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert cartoon, wrote a blog post about switching his endorsement from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump, and it’s a great read. Adams was ready to help make Herstory until Hillary proposed her most recent tax plan, which includes raising estate taxes, which Adams views (correctly) as “robbery by government.” In case you hadn’t heard, Hillary wants to force people with a net worth of over $500 million to give the government SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT of their riches.  Well over half, you guys.   And worse, as Adams points out, the actual plan would result in increased taxes on lower value estates too.  And these estate taxes would be ON TOP OF the income taxes that have already been paid.   Adams paints the picture: In my case, a dollar I earn today will be taxed at about 50% by various government entities, collectively. With Clinton’s plan, my remaining 50 cents will be taxed again at 50% when I die. So the government would take 75% of my earnings from now on. There’s a good reason Adams opposes the estate tax, and there’s a good reason you should too: I oppose the estate tax because I was born to modest means and worked 7-days a week for most of my life to be in my current position. (I’m working today, Sunday, as per usual.) And I don’t want to give 75% of my earnings to the government. (Would you?) How does anyone defend such a proposition?  It’s theft, plain and simple. As you might expect from a hilarious cartoonist, Adams also gives snarky reasons he’s switching his vote.  Like this one: It seems to me that Trump supporters are planning for the world’s biggest party on election night whereas Clinton supporters seem to be preparing for a funeral. I want to be invited to the event that doesn’t involve crying and moving to Canada. Adams explains Trump’s strategy in a way that even Trump’s top strategists should be taking note of, because it’s perfect: Trump always takes the extreme position on matters of safety and security for the country, even if those positions are unconstitutional, impractical, evil, or something that the military would refuse to do. Normal people see this as a dangerous situation. Trained persuaders like me see this as something called pacing and leading. Trump “paces” the public – meaning he matches them in their emotional state, and then some. He does that with his extreme responses on immigration, fighting ISIS, stop-and-frisk, etc. Once Trump has established himself as the biggest bad-ass on the topic, he is free to “lead,” which we see him do by softening his deportation stand, limiting his stop-and-frisk comment to Chicago, reversing his first answer on penalties for abortion, and so on. If you are not trained in persuasion, Trump look scary. If you understand pacing and leading, you might see him as the safest candidate who has ever gotten this close to the presidency. That’s how I see him. Adams attributes Trump’s suitability for the role of president to his persuasive personality: Most of the job of president is persuasion. Presidents don’t need to understand policy minutia. They need to listen to experts and then help sell the best expert solutions to the public. Trump sells better than anyone you have ever seen, even if you haven’t personally bought into him yet. You can’t deny his persuasion talents that have gotten him this far. No.  You really can’t deny his persuasion talents. 41 more days, y’all.  41 more days.",0,0,1
495,"(CNN)Hillary Clinton was deemed the winner of Monday night's debate by 62% of voters who tuned in to watch, while just 27% said they thought Donald Trump had the better night, according to a CNN/ORC Poll of voters who watched the debate. That drubbing is similar to Mitt Romney's dominant performance over President Barack Obama in the first 2012 presidential debate. Voters who watched said Clinton expressed her views more clearly than Trump and had a better understanding of the issues by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. READ: The complete full CNN/ORC poll results The gap was smaller on which candidate appeared more sincere and authentic, though still broke in Clinton's favor, with 53% saying she was more sincere vs. 40% who felt Trump did better on that score. Trump topped Clinton 56% to 33% as the debater who spent more time attacking their opponent. Although the survey suggested debate watchers were more apt to describe themselves as Democrats than the overall pool of voters, even independents who watched deemed Clinton the winner, 54% vs. 33% who thought Trump did the best job in the debate. And the survey suggests Clinton outperformed the expectations of those who watched. While pre-debate interviews indicated these watchers expected Clinton to win by a 26-point margin, that grew to 35 points in the post-debate survey. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? About half in the poll say the debate did not have an effect on their voting plans, 47% said it didn't make a difference, but those who say they were moved by it tilted in Clinton's direction, 34% said the debate made them more apt to vote for Clinton, 18% more likely to back Trump. On the issues, voters who watched broadly say Clinton would do a better job handling foreign policy, 62% to 35%, and most think she would be the better candidate to handle terrorism, 54% to 43% who prefer Trump. But on the economy, the split is much closer, with 51% saying they favor Clinton's approach vs. 47% who prefer Trump. Most debate watchers came away from Monday's face-off with doubts about Trump's ability to handle the presidency. Overall, 55% say they didn't think Trump would be able to handle the job of president, 43% said they thought he would. Among political independents who watched the debate, it's a near-even split, 50% say he can handle it, 49% that he can't. CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims in the first presidential debate And voters who watched were more apt to see Trump's attacks on Clinton as unfair than they were to see her critiques that way. About two-thirds of debate viewers, 67%, said Clinton's critiques of Trump were fair, while just 51% said the same of Trump. Assessments of Trump's attacks on Clinton were sharply split by gender, with 58% of men seeing them as fair compared with 44% of women who watched on Monday. There was almost no gender divide in perceptions of whether Clinton's attacks were fair. The CNN/ORC post-debate poll includes interviews with 521 registered voters who watched the September 26 debate. Results among debate-watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Respondents were originally interviewed as part of a September 23-25 telephone survey of a random sample of Americans, and indicated they planned to watch the debate and would be willing to be re-interviewed when it was over.

186,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media. Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump. Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans: Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.

108,"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, thereâs nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile. Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, weâd think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women. Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didnât exactly go over well. One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show . Chelsea began by asking Priebus: âWho the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?â Adding: âThis is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.â Chelsea then said: âStop telling women to smile. We donât like that. Itâs not an icebreaker, itâs a deal breaker.â Going for Priebusâ jugular, Chelsea absolutelyÂ destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: âYou know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumoniaÂ and trounces Trump in November.â And thatâs exactly right. Watch the full video here:  ",0,1,0
1518,"I’m so disappointed by this. We mentioned this on our show earlier this week, but the Perpetually Offended Brigade set their sights on Disney’s Maui Halloween Costume, calling it “brownface” and disrespectful to Polynesian cultures, and cultural appropriation, and probably a bunch of other stupid things that only perpetually offended losers get bent out of shape about. Here’s the Maui character from the upcoming Disney film Moana.  Perhaps you remember the outrage from a couple months ago, when people decided they were also angry that the Maui character is fat.  If you missed that story, here you go.  In that post, we are reminded that Maui is a demi-god character in an ANIMATED FICTIONAL DISNEY MOVIE.  And yet, people are still mad. But the outrage went even further, because now people are mad about the Maui Halloween costume.  Here’s what it looks like:  Infuriating, huh.  I mean, how DARE they create a costume that so closely resembles the character? Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t the point of dressing up as a character for Halloween to look AS MUCH LIKE THAT CHARACTER as possible?  And if in fact, that IS the point, then WTF is all the fuss about?  The costume is made to look like the character.  WHICH IS FICTIONAL. That’s it.  End of story. But squeaky wheels apparently get the grease in our culture now, so Disney has pulled the costume, which I think is patently ridiculous.  They will no longer sell it.  Their statement said: “The team behind ‘Moana’ has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific Islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some. We sincerely apologize and are pulling the costume from our website and stores.” Translation:  We have no backbone.  Or testicles.  Or common sense. Please add this to the ever-growing list of things that progressives insist on being total killjoys about. Way to let the SJW morons win, Disney. Gawd.",0,0,1
1427,"I love a story with a happy ending! When a Palestinian teenager attempted to lure an Israeli soldier into an ambush, the last thing he probably expected was to be shot down before he could carry out his fatal plan. It makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.  If there’s one thing you need to know about Israeli soldiers, male and female, it’s that they are trained to know the moves you are going to make before you even think about making them. They are faced with life and death situations every single day, because they live in the most dangerous area in the world and have been targeted by Palestinians and Muslims around the world for as long as anyone can remember. Apparently this 16 year-old didn’t know what you and I know, and it was the very last mistake he ever made. A surveillance camera captured the 21-second event where Issa Tarayra – as identified by the Palestinian Health Ministry – approached an IDF soldier before attempting to stab him. Forces responded to the threat immediately and put the young man down. Luckily nobody but Tarayra was harmed, as the soldier that was targeted had managed to duck out of the way of the knife just in time. Watch the video below, but be aware that while it’s not extremely graphic footage, it may be considered shocking to some. Viewer discretion is advised:   According to The Daily Mail, this is the ninth attack of its kind since the end of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha and ahead of October’s Jewish holidays. I can’t say I feel too terribly bad for the kid, who decided to risk his life on one stupid act. One less scumbag in the world and good riddance. ",0,0,1
72,"When Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump take the debate stage at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York tonight for the highly anticipated first presidential debate of the general election, Gary Johnson will be watching on television some 30 miles away in Twitter's Chelsea office in Manhattan — armed only with a Twitter handle. The campaign for the Libertarian Party nominee is hoping to interject his voice into the debate from the sidelines through an aggressive Twitter and media strategy. Both Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, will be live-tweeting throughout the evening. ""Govs. Johnson and Weld will be making themselves available to the media, watching the debate with great interest, and will be anxious to point out how a third voice, representing millions of independent voters disenfranchised by the Republican and Democrat parties, would better serve the American people,"" campaign communications director Joe Hunter told ABC News in a statement. He added, ""They will be respectful and not interested in any grandstanding for the cameras or inappropriate 'protests.'"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein will be challenging her exclusion from the debate by holding a rally outside the secured perimeter of the debate hall. However, her campaign says she will not ""risk arrest,"" given that there is an active warrant for her arrest because of her involvement in a recent protest against a controversial pipeline project in North Dakota. In 2012, she and her running mate were arrested outside Hofstra University when they attempted to enter the grounds during a presidential debate between President Barack Obama and then–Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Instead, she plans to be live on Periscope during the debate, answering the same questions that are lobbed at Clinton and Trump on the debate stage. Johnson failed to qualify for the first presidential debate after he fell short of the 15 percent polling threshold for for inclusion set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. His recent national polling average stands at 9 percent, with the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll published over the weekend putting him at 5 percent. Although he previously said it would be ""game over"" for his campaign if he failed to qualify for the debates, he now says that it is ""an ongoing process"" to try to reach the 15 percent threshold for subsequent debates this fall. In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Johnson criticized the Commission on Presidential Debates over its formula for deciding who is included in the debates, saying that the panel is ""made up of Republicans and Democrats that just have no intention whatsoever in seeing anyone other than a Republican or Democrat on the debate stage."" Johnson's campaign is touting an online petition that has garnered over 1 million signatures in support of Johnson's inclusion in the debates. ABC News' MaryAlice Parks contributed reporting. ",1,0,0
1361,"FBI Director James Comey warned Tuesday that the increasing success of the military campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq carries an ominous downside: a wave of terrorist fighters who will spread across the globe as the group loses control of its territory on the ground. ""The so-called caliphate will be crushed. The challenge will be: through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of very, very dangerous people,"" Comey said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on the global terror threat. ""They will not all die on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq. There will be a terrorist diaspora sometime in the next two to five years like we've never seen before."" Story Continued Below ""We must prepare ourselves and our allies particularly in western Europe to confront that threat because when ISIL is reduced to an insurgency and those killers flow out they will try to come to western Europe and try to come here to kill innocent people,"" the FBI director said. He said the wave of fighters will be larger than the one that came out of Afghanistan after the war there in the 1980s. Committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) acknowledged that the territory governed by ISIL has decreased, but he said the campaign against the group has been so slow that the group is reconstituting elsewhere. ""We haven’t reduced their capability. The diaspora has already begun,"" Johnson said. ""We're poking the hive. We've done some damage to it but the killer bees are leaving the hive. They’re setting up new hives."" National Counterterrorism Center Director Nicholas Rasmussen said intelligence officials had long predicted the threat would metastasize as ISIL was squeezed. ""It’s not surprising. It puts us in a period of sustained vulnerability that I don’t think any of us are comfortable with. But I think it’s a reality,"" he said. Despite the fears of terrorist fighters flowing out of Iraq and Syria, some senators said a more urgent worry is that the FBI is missing opportunities to head off home-grown terrorist attacks like the shooting at an Orlando nightclub in June where 49 people were killed and the bombings earlier this month in New York and New Jersey. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) noted that FBI investigators looked at the suspects in those attacks long before the violence, but closed those inquiries without bringing charges. ""I'm also troubled the FBI is not even willing to admit they made some mistakes,"" Paul complained. ""These are judgment calls and the judgment calls were incorrect and I think we should just admit that and look at some of the facts."" Paul said the FBI failed to get video from a gun shop that could have shown shooter Omar Mateen buying a weapon shortly before the attack, but Comey said the FBI wasn't told about that visit promptly and by the time it was notified the video was already erased. However, Paul said the FBI should have kept an investigation into Mateen open longer because it might have exposed his plan to attack the Pulse nightclub. Comey said the FBI can keep such probes open indefinitely and repeatedly extended the one in Florida. ""We should keep them open longer...as long as the facts warrant,"" the FBI director said. ""We have the policies and the tools we need to do this well."" He added that agents have to make a ""judgement every day"" about whether specific cases merit further investigation. Ayotte questioned why agents handling the pre-shooting investigation of Mateen never looked at his social media or internet activity, even the publicly available information. Comey said the FBI had two people interacting directly with Mateen, leading the case agent to think he had ""a pretty good vector into [Mateen's] state of mind."" Ayotte said it still seemed odd that the FBI wouldn't also check his public online activity, especially as the FBI presses for more access to encrypted communications. ""It just seems surprising to me that there wasn’t some kind of online work done in something so significant,"" the New Hampshire Republican said. Comey said a review of the Florida probe is nearly done and another is in the works. He also said an assessment will be done of the handling of earlier inquiries into New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami, but that inquiry will be complicated by the pending prosecutions of the suspect who is currently in a Newark hospital being treated for a gunshot wound. ""We are going to go back,"" the FBI director said. ""You will find us being very candid about our shortcomings and our strengths.""",1,0,0
251,"(CNN)Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed. It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!"" McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is. ""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool."" The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control. Annie Nelson gave McAuliffe some wiggle room in her follow-up tweet, directed at the governor and CNN political commentator (and former Bill Clinton aide) Paul Begala.

294,"(CNN)It is incredibly difficult to overstate Donald Trump's influence on the 2016 presidential race. Unless, of course, you are Donald Trump. The billionaire building mogul and reality TV-star-turned-Republican nominee has a showman's talent for claiming attention -- and credit for just about anything he wants. For decades now, Trump has made an art of celebrating his lead role, real or imagined, in a laundry list of business and entertainment ventures. His entry into the political world has done little to curtail the habit. Here are a handful of Trump's most outlandish claims: That he pioneered the 'airplane rallies' politicians have used for decades For decades, barnstorming candidates have parked planes, headlined rallies, then flown off to their next stop on the hustings. Trump, too, is fond of pulling up a podium in front of his ""Trump Force One"" 757 jet and speaking to supporters at airfields and in hangars. Clinton did something similar on Monday, holding a brief news conference in front her own plane. A day later, Trump pounced. ""Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies(?)"" he asked in a tweet on Tuesday morning. ""She puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning."" But was Clinton really ""copying"" Trump? Mitt Romney, George W. Bush, John Kerry and John McCain (among so many others) might disagree. Even Ronald Reagan used his plane as a prop. In fact, candidates have been using their vehicles of choice (or necessity) as backdrops for campaign rallies for more than 100 years. In 19th and early 20th centuries, though, that usually meant a train and a ""whistlestop"" rally. That he 'finished' birtherism in 2011 Trump took credit last week for having ""finished"" the conspiracy theory he nurtured and promoted for so long. After falsely accusing Clinton of having ""started the birther controversy,"" Trump said: ""I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States -- period."" The basis for the claim? Another dubious assertion, from 2011, when President Barack Obama released his long form birth certificate in an effort to stamp out any remaining sliver of doubt about his birthplace. ""I am really honored frankly to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,"" Trump told reporters then, effectively claiming credit for the President's decision. ""We have to look at (the birth certificate), we have to see is it real, is it proper, what's on it, but I hope it checks out beautifully. I am really proud, I am really honored."" He would spend the next five years perpetuating the smear. That he brought the Republican convention to Ohio The timeline tells the story. July 8, 2014: The Republican National Committee awards Cleveland the party's 2016 convention. June 16, 2015: Donald Trump enters the Republican presidential primary. June 18, 2016: Trump tells Fox News, ""I wanted (the convention) to be in Ohio. I recommended Ohio."" ""I wanted it to be here,"" Trump told Fox's Bill O'Reilly in an interview as the convention got underway. ""And we had lots of choices. I wanted it to be in Ohio. I recommended Ohio."" Factcheck.org looked into the claim and found ""no evidence"" to support it. That he got Hillary Clinton to say 'radical Islamism' After months of being hammered by a variety of Republicans for being too politically correct, Hillary Clinton in June uttered the words ""radical Islamism"" in an interview on CNN's ""New Day."" But the context is relevant: Clinton was responding to a question about the criticism and explaining why she does not use the term regularly or in stump speeches. ""Whether you call it radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing,"" she said. ""I am happy to say either. But what I won't do, because I think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion. That plays right into ISIS' hands."" Undeterred, Trump tweeted his delight -- and took credit for what he described as Clinton's capitulation. ""I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!,"" he wrote. That he was being congratulated for 'being right on Radical Islam' after the Orlando attack Giving new meaning to the term ""Congrats Twitter,"" Trump on the morning after the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history tweeted his thanks for ""being right"" about the threat of domestic terror. ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance,"" he wrote. ""We must be smart!"" Trump never specified the source of those congrats and the comment was met with considerable and colorful -- see the responses to the tweet -- online backlash. That he broke 'the glass ceiling' for women On the same night Clinton, who in her 2008 primary concession speech famously lamented that ""we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling,"" became the first woman in American history to claim the title of presumptive major-party presidential nominee, Trump told Fox News not to discount his own appeal to female voters. After all, he reminded host Bill O'Reilly, ""I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry."" Trump has been credited -- by others -- for his hiring practices, but he's also been criticized for a litany of ugly public statements about women in all fields. That he inspired Budweiser to rebrand its beer as America' On May 10, reports first surfaced that Budweiser would temporarily rename its signature product. Instead of simply Budweiser, the beer will for the next few months be called ""America."" The next morning, Trump was asked by ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Steve Doocy if he thought his campaign ""had something to do with"" the decision. ""I think so,"" Trump replied. ""[Budweiser is] so impressed with what our country will become that they decided to do this before the fact."" That he forced Ford's years-old decision to shift some truck production to Ohio In October 2015, Trump declared that ""even my harshest critics gave me credit"" for Ford's decision to ""build a massive plant in the United States."" He also cited his ""constant badgering"" as the impetus for the automaker's scrapped plans for a new one in Mexico. One small problem: the claims were false, according to Ford. ""We decided to move the F-650 and F-750 medium-duty trucks to Ohio Assembly in 2011, long before any candidates announced their intention to run for U.S. president,"" Ford said in response. The construction of a $2.5 billion engine and transmission plant in Mexico is slated to go ahead as planned, the company confirmed. That he aided in the release of Americans in a prisoner swap with Iran When the U.S. and Iran agreed to a prisoner swap in January that brought home, among others, Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, officials said the agreement came after more than a year of tightly-held negotiations ""accelerated"" by parallel nuclear talks. Trump had other ideas. ""So I've been hitting them hard and I think I might have had something to do with it,"" he said at the South Carolina Tea Party Convention. ""You want to know the truth? It's a part of my staple thing, I mean, I go crazy when I hear about this, you go absolutely wild because how is it possible?"" That he caused planned federal raids on undocumented immigrants In response to the Washington Post's December 2015 report that the Obama administration had signed off on a federal effort to track down and deport undocumented families who had entered the country over the past year, Trump pounced. ""Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS,"" he tweeted. ""It's about time!"" In another tweet, sent less than 24 hours later on Christmas Day, Trump again credited himself for the decision: ""Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!"" That he had a role in Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's decision to withdraw his bid for House Speaker In October, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy abandoned his bid to move up a slot and replace John Boehner as speaker. The California congressman's campaign had been hampered by conservative holdouts in the GOP's tea party wing and effectively buried by McCarthy himself when had admitted in an interview that a House Benghazi probe was a vehicle for blunting Hillary Clinton's presidential ambitions. Enter Trump, who at a campaign rally in Las Vegas offered a slightly different narrative. ""They're giving me a lot of credit for that because I said you really need someone very, very, tough and very smart,"" he said. ""You know, smart goes with tough. I know tough people that aren't smart. That's the worst. We need smart, we need tough, we need the whole package. That he alone drove viewers to the first GOP debate The first Republican primary debate, held on Aug. 6 in Cleveland, drew 24 million viewers, a record-breaking figure that a Fox News spokeswoman said made it the highest rated telecast the network's nearly two-decade history. Trump took notice. At a rally a few weeks later, he touted the total, adding ""they normally have like 2 million people"" watching. (Note: the first primary debate four years earlier had 3.2 million.) ""I won't take credit for it,"" Trump told supporters in Iowa, ""but believe me, 100 percent it's me. A hundred percent. It's true. It's true!"" That he denied Jeb Bush the GOP nomination Jeb Bush entered the Republican primary race as the odds-on favorite to follow in his father and brother's footsteps. He exited, on Feb. 20, a defeated man -- or, as Trump explained to the New York Times, a man defeated by Donald Trump. ""I think Jeb would have been the nominee had I not gotten in,"" he said, ""but I was able to define Jeb early."" Indeed, Bush never seemed to come have an answer for Trump's unrelenting, mocking attacks. That he won the 2012 GOP primary in Nevada for Mitt Romney How exactly did Mitt Romney win the Nevada caucuses back in 2012? Donald Trump has an idea. In the aftermath of the eventual nominee's victory, Trump, who endorsed Romney days earlier, chalked up the result... to Trump. ""There was a lot riding on that particular race in Nevada and it was interesting, because the numbers were much, much greater than you thought,"" Trump said during a chat with ""Fox and Friends."" ""And a lot of people are giving me credit for that. And I will accept that credit. Always accept credit."" That he made Lady Gaga a star In his 2011 book, ""Time to Get Tough: Make America Great Again!,"" Trump took a bow for helping to launch the pop star's soaring celebrity. ""I really believe I had at least something to do with it,"" he wrote. ""She became a big star and maybe she became a star because I put her on the Miss Universe pageant. It's very possible, who knows what would have happened without it, because she caused a sensation."" ",1,0,0
1114,"Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has paid his family's businesses more than $8.2 million, according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance filings, which reveals an integrated business and political operation without precedent in national politics. The GOP presidential nominee’s campaign has paid his various businesses for services including rent for his campaign offices ($1.3 million), food and facilities for events and meetings ($544,000) and payroll for Trump corporate staffers ($333,000) who helped with everything from his traveling security to his wife’s convention speech. Story Continued Below In all, the Trump campaign’s payments to Trump-owned businesses account for about 7 percent of its $119 million spending total, the analysis found. That’s an unprecedented amount of self-dealing in federal politics. Even the wealthiest of candidates have refrained from tapping their businesses’ resources to such an extensive degree, either because their businesses are structured in a manner that doesn’t legally allow them to do it with flexibility, or because they’re leery of the allegations of pocket-padding that inevitably arise when politicians use their campaigns or committees to pay their businesses or families. Trump, on the other hand, appears to have structured his businesses in a way that lets the campaign use them without legal restriction. And he certainly doesn’t appear to feel any embarrassment about flouting political norms that typically compel candidates to distance themselves from their businesses during campaigns. Quite to the contrary, Trump — who in 2000 predicted “I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it” — has used the campaign itself as a marketing platform to promote everything from the difficult-to-find Trump Steaks to his golf courses and a new Washington hotel. Trump’s tangle of businesses has raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest should he win the presidency, while the Trump-branded campaign has drawn mockery and allegations of pocket-padding from Trump’s critics. His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in July accused Trump of “spending his meager campaign resources on … himself.” In a statement, the Trump campaign said: ""Mr. Trump has largely self-funded his campaign and continues to make significant contributions which far exceed the amounts the campaign is required to pay. The campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.” The degree to which Trump or his corporations may be benefiting from his campaign is unclear, partly because the financial and legal structures of his businesses — and their relationships with his campaign — remain opaque. Trump has stubbornly refused to release his taxes, which could shed light on the issue. Additionally, the campaign’s payments to Trump-owned businesses are dwarfed by the $54 million Trump has pumped into his campaign. In fact, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show that more than $500,000 in services such as rent, software and staff from Trump-owned businesses were donated to the campaign — including some of the salary paid to Trump’s head of security Keith Schiller, who travels everywhere with the candidate. In those situations, Trump likely either wrote off the cost of services rendered by his companies to his campaign, or he personally reimbursed the campaign for the costs of the services. While federal election law prohibits corporations from donating cash, goods or services to campaigns, the regulations do include an exception — and it’s the one that election law experts interviewed for this story say Trump is most likely using. It allows people who own certain types of companies — including LLCs or sole proprietorships — to donate from those entities to campaigns and have those donations be considered to have come from the person. It’s unclear precisely how Trump’s various businesses are structured, but he likely would have to be the sole owner of the ones that are donating services to the campaign in order for those donations to pass legal muster. “Most wealthy candidates separate their businesses from their campaign organizations, and that’s partly because their companies are either publicly owned or owned by multiple people,” said GOP election lawyer Jason Torchinsky. He represented Rudy Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign, which paid the former New York mayor’s companies for office space, security and legal consulting, but finished the campaign owing money to them. “It’s unique to have somebody who is independently wealthy and is able to so thoroughly integrate a privately held company into their campaign,” Torchinsky said of Trump. Regardless of how Trump’s corporate entities are structured, the campaign is legally required to charge them fair-market rates for goods or services received, even if Trump ultimately writes off the bills as donations. There have been allegations that the campaign failed to pay Trump’s companies fair-market value for some services, including for the Trump corporate staffer who helped write Melania Trump's convention speech (the campaign paid her $356.01 through Trump Tower Commercial LLC), and the corporate lawyer who penned threatening letters to a donor and PAC supporting Jeb Bush. Among the goods and services that Trump has paid his companies for are $34,500 for lodging and event staging at Trump National Doral golf course, $48,200 for room rental and catering from the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, N.Y., and $142,000 to Trump Restaurants for rent, utilities, meals and office supplies. It paid more than $1 million to Trump Tower to rent office space for its main campaign headquarters. Trump Ice, his bottled water company, got $1,300, while his son Eric Trump's Virginia winery was paid almost $5,000 for catering and event space. The bulk of the spending, almost $6 million, went to a company called TAG Air for use of Trump’s private plane. The campaign has also paid $432,000 to Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla., for lodging, facility rental and catering. And Trump continues to simultaneously use and promote facilities he owns, even sometimes using misdirection to do so. One of Trump’s primary election victory speeches in March, held at Mar-a-Lago, was widely lampooned as an infomercial for Trump-branded steaks, water, magazines and wine. And last week, he lured the political press corp to his new Washington hotel by promising a revelation about his longstanding allegations that President Obama was born overseas, which he finally disavowed. Before getting to that, though, he took the opportunity to promote the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in the Old Post Office. Whatever the campaign paid to use the ballroom in the Old Post Office that day won’t be disclosed until next month’s FEC report. But back in January, the campaign spent $5,000 to rent space in the hotel. During a March tour of the hotel, Trump boasted to the press that the hotel would have “one of the biggest ballrooms in Washington, and by far the most luxurious ballroom."" He also quipped that the completion of the hotel would mean he will wind up with a presence on Pennsylvania Avenue “one way or the other.""",1,0,0

1563,"For many Americans, the choice they make on their ballots in November has everything to do with the role the next president will play in shaping our Supreme Court. Conservatives have emphasized how important it is that we elect someone who will fight for and preserve our constitutional rights by nominating justices who follow in the footsteps of the late Antonin Scalia. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have laid out their plans for the country if elected, but, as pointed out by conservative evangelical leader Franklin Graham, only one candidate has released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees — Trump. “The public needs to recognize that this presidential election is not about personalities the way the media is trying to make it sound,” Graham wrote in a Facebook post Monday. The prominent religious leader argued, instead, that this presidential election is about filling the Supreme Court vacancy with someone who will follow the U.S. Constitution. “This court and their rulings on issues of religious freedom, marriage, abortion, and much more will impact this country for our lifetime and the lifetime of our children and grandchildren,” Graham wrote. “There’s so much on the line here.” Pointing out that the next president would nominate at least one justice — and potentially several more — over the next four years, Graham asked his friends to “pray about who to vote for.” But, he also challenged us to educate ourselves on the candidate’s potential Supreme Court nominees, so we will know where they stand on the future of the nation’s highest court — something that is possible with only one candidate, Trump, because Clinton has not released a list of names she would consider.  On Friday, Trump released his most recent update to a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, and it included a highly qualified and diverse field of candidates that is sure to satisfy conservatives and freedom-loving voters across the country. Meanwhile, we’re left to simply speculate about which anti-gun, anti-life and anti-religious freedom justice Clinton would nominate. That’s a scary thought, folks, and a risk not worth taking.

1502,"Charlotte has seen some of the worst rioting over a cop shooting in a while and regardless of what the liberal media labels these people, they are not protesters. Protesters have a right to protest. They are protected under the Constitution. No. These folks we have here are rioters. They have burned, smashed, looted and now murdered each other over the latest police shooting (by the way, the officer was black).  Justin Carr, 26, passed away on Thursday after being critically wounded during the riots over the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a black police officer. Carr was shot as rioters fought with police in riot gear lined arm-in-arm standing guard at the Omni Hotel at about 8:30 pm. City officials say Carr was not shot by an officer, but some protesters have claimed that he was wounded by a cop. No arrests have been made in Carr’s death, but a homicide investigation has been launched.  Police Chief Kerr Putney has put detectives on the case to try and find out who it was that made the shot, while the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice have other plans… ‘I saw the man go down on the pavement,’ Minister Steve Knight of Mission gathering Christian Church in Charlotte said. ‘It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.’ Of course. Rioters are burning, looting and beating people, and it’s the cops. These people are pathetic. Knight also claimed: ‘We would like to see surveillance video from the surrounding area that may have captured the shooting to determine who was responsible for the shooting.’ Justin Carr is dead. Shot in the head. Does this sound like a peaceful protest? Well, it’s not one I’m familiar with. Is there any reasoning or waiting for the facts anymore?   ",0,0,1
1488,"Dang… and I thought our Social Justice Zealots were insane (I mean, they are. But this is NUTS). In this video, a Muslim woman from Perth, Australia, is having an unholy fit when she sees someone wearing a Pauline Hanson shirt. If you don’t know, Pauline Hanson is a right-wing senator in Australia who has proposed a ban on Muslim immigration in her country. Oh, and this confrontation took place on a university campus, which doesn’t surprise me – Well, she’s got the special snowflake screeching down. I’ll give her that much. According to this, the man with the shirt said he was a former student coming to meet with someone on campus and he has every right to be there, even though the Muslim woman demanded he leave. Just because he was wearing a shirt. Listen lady – maybe that’s how they do things in Islamic countries where you aren’t even allowed to THINK anything that goes against Muslim beliefs, but in first-world civilizations, we welcome ALL KINDS of opinions. Well, that’s the theory, at least. Maybe not much longer if the Cult of Social Justice gets their way.",0,0,1
190,"The epidemic of black men being killed at the hands of police officers in America has not gone unnoticed on the international stage. According to a According to a report by a United Nations working group, which will be debated at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday, this situation constitutes a full-blown “human rights crisis” that is reminiscent of the days of lynchings. “Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching,” said the report by the U.N. Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. The U.N. report draws a stark comparison between modern day fatal shootings at the hands of law enforcement and the lynchings of blacks that swept the nation in the 19th and 20th centuries. The report comes as racial tensions in America have boiled over yet again in the wake of more deadly shootings that have rocked the country. Historically, the majority of African Americans killed in lynchings were hanged. The Equal Justice Initiative released a report in 2015 which said that between 1877 and 1950, an estimated 3,959 black people were murdered in “racial terror lynchings” throughout the country’s southern states. The U.N. report follows a January visit to the U.S. by a five-member group, which was chaired by Filipino law professor Ricardo A. Sunga III. The group says that despite efforts at reform, they still remain “extremely concerned” about the “human rights crisis” facing blacks living in the U.S., and this is especially true considering protesters are once again flooding the streets of American cities to protest the killings of still more black men in recent days. “In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent. “Impunity for State violence has resulted in the current human rights crisis and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.” The experts’ group pointed out that these killings go unpunished because the investigation is biased and tainted from the beginning since police departments are investigating their own. Adding to this is the fact that prosecutors have discretion when it comes to presenting charges and U.S. law enforcement officers are not held to international standards for use of force. To address the situation, they recommended that the U.S. institute a system to reliably track police killings nationwide and instances of excessive use of force. They also said that racial profiling must be brought to an end, which is “a rampant practice and seriously damages the trust between African-Americans and law enforcement officials.” The group also said that improving race relations will also require education that must be “accompanied by acts of reconciliation” in order to successfully overcome the bigotry that plagues the U.S. and the past injustices that have been perpetrated against black people on American soil. The report added that the lasting negative effects caused by enslavement and racial injustice must be recognized by both federal and state laws. ",0,1,0

926,"Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s media team went to work tonight on Donald Trump and the torrent of offensive statements, lies, and delusions that he said during tonight’s debate. Cataloging all of the most egregious offenses, it’s a laundry list of reasons – any one of which should be a disqualifier – of why Trump would be a catastrophe as the President of the United States. 1.Trump mocked former Miss Universe Alicia Machado’s weight and heritage, calling her names like “Miss Housekeeping” and “Miss Piggy.” Huffington Post, May 23, 2016 2. Donald Trump: “Pregnancy is never–it’s a wonderful thing for the woman. It’s a wonderful thing for the husband. It’s certainly an inconvenience for a business…And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.”  5. In the 1970s, Trump’s real estate company was sued by the Department of Justice for discriminating against minority applicants in both New York and Virginia–in New York, their applications were marked “C” for colored. The Washington Post, January 23, 2016 6. Trump falsely accused Hillary Clinton of starting the “birther” rumors about President Obama. He promoted the conspiracy for years after his campaign says he “ended” it. 7. Trump is wildly misleading when he says violent crime is on the rise. 8. Trump claims he’s the “law and order” candidate, but he opposes gun-free zones and supports Americans owning assault weapons. 9. Part of a history of stiffing his contractors, Trump refused to pay an architect what he was owed after designing the clubhouse for one of Trump’s golf courses. Trump offered just one-sixth the original invoice, and then bullied him with a “take-it or you’ll have to sue me” approach. 10. In the words of his campaign manager, Trump “built a lot of his business on the backs of the little guy” and has a history of “not paying contractors after [they have helped him] build something.” 11. Trump regularly lies and misleads when it comes to Hillary Clinton’s emails. 12. Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, breaking a decades-long precedent of transparency for presidential nominees. 13. Donald Trump said he’s doing “almost 120 deals” outside the U.S., but since he hasn’t released his tax returns we don’t know with who or for what. 14. Donald Trump is proposing a tax plan with a “Trump Loophole” that gives the wealthy a backdoor tax cut, establishing a 15% rate for business owners like Donald Trump. 16. Trump’s economic plans will add $5.3 trillion to the national debt, according to a non-partisan analysis. 17. According to a nonpartisan analysis, Donald Trump’s plans would cost the economy 3.5 million jobs. Hillary Clinton’s would create 10 million jobs. 19. On Libyan intervention: 21. Trump said that Hillary Clinton wants to create “totally open borders,” a claim Politifact rated “false.” 22. Trump likes to say that Hillary Clinton is the founder of ISIS. She’s not.
