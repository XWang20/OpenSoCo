These organizations are huge, professional, and know what they're doing. They are constantly at the Visa offices working to get their new players the right paperwork. They have millions to spend to make sure everything is perfect. They are representing highly visible and public organizations. You tell a visa office you are going to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates they'll probably know what you're talking about. Tell them you're going to play for Team Liquid they might get a little more confused.

Even if there is a legally available visa for ""Esports"" players, they have to prove they qualify. They have to prove they're employed by who they say they are, that the tournament they're going to exists, that they have been invited, and that, most of all, that when their visa is up, they will leave the country and return back to where they came from, after having paid all the necessary taxes for the money they earned, legally, here in the United States.

I don't mean explosions and gunfire - I mean strategical thought and foresight being critical to success. Gamers aren't idiots, and the clearest lesson the COD franchise has shown is that continuously catering to them makes for a terrible game. DICE should thank COD for increasing the multiplayer FPS market as those millions are ripe for the picking.

But if you are going to do it, it must be done will full awareness and display of the fact that this will be a deliberate, cerebral experience. BF3 is where wit defeats twitch, but not without excitement, and yes, bullets and explosions - and of course all those important battlefield moments that define the series. This game will balance the fun of firing with the considerations of reality.

I say start with the chatter. Military-esque communication between players, if carefully thought out and delivered, (and preferably not just realistic, but almost instructive to would-be players), could in one fair swoop show that gaming has grown beyond team deathmatches and subtle, incremental improvements at full price, to teamwork, coordination, and even planning in order to succeed.

I would highly suggest getting some type of swaddle transition that allows little one to roll over and not feel so free. It's most likely he still hasn't lost his moro reflex entirely and that coupled with the sleep regression can be what's causing it. I got my son a [zipadee zip](http://www.sleepingbaby.com/collections/zipadee-zip/products/its-a-bugs-life). Unfortunately we didn't start my son in his until he was 7 months old, because we tried the Merlin Suit and swaddling when his sleep got really bad. He didn't roll while swaddled or in the suit, and I think that since he didn't have that freedom, his sleep was pretty bad. Right now I think we're going through the 8 month sleep regression. He's taking crap naps and waking up at 4 am, and teething on top of it all.

Just wanted to add that I too had a bad day today. I was feeling like a failure, being sick on top of it all doesn't help either. So I totally understand how you feel.

2933,"Take a look at what /u/nrgins posted below, he's explaining the concept of a relational database.

Your goal when designing a database is to avoid duplicating data whenever possible.  All your employee roster info should always stay in the roster table, and if you want to link an employee to another item, like a task or a timesheet, you use their employee_id.  Then, you tell the database to use that employee ID and go back to the roster table and get any info you want on-the-fly.

Let me whip something up in Access real quick, I'll show you what we're talking about.  I'll post it a little later today.

Side Note: Be super careful about storing SSN in your database, that's protected data and if your really don't need to there, just don't store it.  Adds a lot of potential headaches for no real upside.  Just my 2 cents, my office deals with SSN all day and we try to avoid storing it in our own databases wherever possible.",1,0

that make it sound like you're just covering your ears. I list stats and discussion and you just say nope you're wrong I'm laughing.

You keep saying over and over that you wanted Evans and McCoy. Not once have I said you were wrong for wanting that all I've *ever* said was asking you *WHY* you want those guys so much. If it's just a hunch then fine so be it just say that, but I've presented actual stats and trends and discussion on why I would think differently and all you've rebutted with was that I was wrong and a slave to ADP or something.

You haven't tried to explain anything. Your only explanation has been ""I don't follow ADP"" or ""I just liked those guys."" That's fine, but when I ask for actual, logical reasoning you continue to ignore the request and try to play it off like I'm just a rankings drone (ignoring all the facts and stats I presented to support my ideas).

You can be happy with your pick and I never said you shouldn't be.

We should be focused on real problems like water pollution and over fishing instead of trying to combat carbon to save marine life. And the polar ice caps are NOT melting. As I said before they can detect the size of the ice pack with satellites. Since the 60's the polar caps have been growing! And emissions of CO2 have never been higher.

I'm sorry, then you're going to be alone. Because you literally cannot date unless you put yourself out there and risk the rejection. Everyone gets rejected. Everyone. Sure, there are women out there who are really confident and will walk up to guys and ask them out. But a lot of us (me included) aren't comfortable doing that. What possible advice could you get other than to -- try. You can't just magically get a girlfriend without making an effort. So your anger here is ridiculous and unwarranted. So yeah, if you never get the nerve to approach a girl, you're going to die without ever kissing one/having sex/having a relationship. That's the cold, hard truth. You absolutely CAN do it. You just won't. The guys who can don't have some magic secret that allows them to do it. They just do it. There's no fate or no special trick to it, it's just a matter of finding the courage and asking.

The upside? Plenty of shy guys get the girl. My husband was really shy. Nerdy, even (I happen to like that, that's my type). He jokes that if we hadn't wound up together he'd have died alone because he doesn't have ""game"" but he didn't need it. He talked to me. He made me laugh, he showed me what an awesome person he is. Eventually, he made a move. And that was that. I knew we'd wind up together. He still says if it weren't for me he'd be alone but he's so much fun, everyone loves him and someone would snap him up in a heartbeat. You don't need to be particularly smooth or clever to get a girl to like you. You just talk to them like they're people (because they are) and show an interest in them and if you find a girl you like, you ask her out. I'm shy and awkward as hell (my husband thinks the awkward, weird shit I say is funny, luckily for me) too but I wasn't about to sit in my house and rot because I'm too scared to talk to people.

If you're truly so cripplingly shy that you cannot possibly approach a woman or ask someone out, then you need to talk to a professional about that.

I also saw this in another comment here:

&gt; I'm shy, too. When I say that to people, they laugh, because I no longer SEEM shy to people.

This is what my husband is like. To talk to him now, you'd never know that when he was your age, he was painfully shy, because he trained himself to talk to people (literally just by forcing himself to do it). Now he's that fun, laid back guy that everyone loves because he just forced himself until it became second nature. I knew him when we were teenagers/early 20s and you could barely get 2 words out of him for the longest time. Now he'll chat up total strangers (if I leave him alone at a bar or something I'll come back and he'll be talking to random strangers and making them laugh by the time I get back). By nature he's a really quiet guy but when he needs to be he can be really gregarious, funny and engaging.",0,1

957,"\&gt;The conspiratorial part of me thinks we might be getting half-baked expansions every other time

Oh no, this is absolutely the case. I attribute this in part to Activision obtaining Blizzard.

Vanilla - good game

TBC - good game

WotLK - good game

Activision obtains Blizzard from this point on

Cata - bad game

MoP - good game

WoD - bad game

Legion - good game

BFA  - ?

I picked up on this trend a while ago. I remember playing WoD and less than a year after launch Blizzard pretty much publicly said they were stopping development on WoD and beginning Legion. I was so pissed. I believe Activision hurt WoW's resources to continue developing expansions in 2 year cycles like they did up to WotLK in some way.

I would much rather wait 6 months for a full expansion to be released and just play Legion with smaller updates than rush into a shitshow.

Either provide updated content or don't expect us to pay a subscription (see: WoD)

Release fully finished expansions or don't expect us to pay a AAA price for them (see: Cata, maybe BFA)

Blizzard does neither and expects both. This is why MMOs are dying in the era of Fortnite and LoL, which provide a game AND updates FREE OF CHARGE.",1,0

3909,"Respectfully, I disagree.

Why would they distract from skill? Is it not considered skill if you can deal with, say, Palkia flipping the stage in Spear Pillar? Skill, in my opinion, is the ability to play the game period. If you can't deal with crazier stages, it suggests you aren't so much skilled at the game as you are skilled at a few particularly simple stages. Using the map around you to your advantage is just as much of a skill as your ability to juggle someone by dashing around with Fox.

More than that, if ""the better players would still win anyway"", then what's the problem? Let's get longer matches and crazier deaths, that's what makes the game fun. Watching the same people use the same moves over and over in a few quick matches isn't fun, it's boring. Longer matches suggest that players are more evenly matched, resulting in a more dynamic battle.

I can respect your opinion if you don't like the stages, but I don't think simplifying the stages inherently makes players more skillful.",1,0

2)It depends on the speed the camera can write to both cards, but more often than not, writing to a CF and SD card will slow down the buffer, because SD cards are always going to be slower than CF (due to less contacts/ pins). Another contributing factor is often times the manu. will use a slower buffer for the SD slot. Writing jpegs only to SD may help, but any use of the SD along with the CF slot will slow down your buffer (albeit, not always considerably).
